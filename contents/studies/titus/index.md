TITUS “PREVIEW”
===============

A reference book that is an essential in any study that involves the
Apostle Paul, whether his epistles or his activities and speeches in the
Acts of the Apostles, is the masterful history “The Life and Epistles of
St. Paul”, written in the 19th Century by the Rev. W. J. Conybeare, MA,
and the Very Rev. J. S. Howson, DD.

For what it's worth, this is my all time favorite Christian publication!
I have studied the book twice and read parts of it many times.

From the first paragraph of Conybeare and Howson’s introduction: “The
purpose of this work is to give a living picture of St. Paul himself,
and of the circumstances by which he was surrounded.”

Actually, they did far more than that modest sentence indicates. Either
Conybeare or Howson (or both of them) personally walked and sailed
everywhere that the Apostle traveled! Their account is a great
travelogue, an historical tour-de-force, and an insightful Christian
analysis and examination of Paul's ministry. Included in the book are
the authors' own translations from the Greek of Paul's inspired
writings! The excerpt below will give you an indication to the depth of
thought and careful consideration that went into all their writing.

The book used to be published by Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. of Grand
Rapids, Michigan, USA. They have published both hard cover and paperback
editions, but they tell me now that it’s out of print.

The following is from “The Life and Epistles of St. Paul”, by W. J.
Conybeare and J. S. Howson, Appendix II

Introduction to the Study of Titus
----------------------------------

I can't do better than to start off with the brief introduction of
Conybeare and Howson to the Epistle to Titus.

From “The Life and Epistles of St. Paul” by W. J. Conybeare and J. S.
Howson.

“From Ephesus he [Paul] soon afterward made an expedition to Crete. It
can scarcely be supposed that the Christian Churches of Crete were first
founded during this visit of St. Paul; on the contrary, many indications
in the Epistle to Titus show that they had already lasted for a
considerable time.

“But they were troubled by false teachers, and probably had never yet
been properly organized, having originated, perhaps, in the private
efforts of individual Christians, who would have been supplied with a
centre of operations and nucleus of Churches by the numerous colonies of
Jews established in the island.

“St. Paul now visited them in company with Titus, whom he left in Crete
as his representative on his departure. He himself was unable to remain
long enough to do what was needful, either in silencing error, or in
selecting fit persons as presbyters of the numerous scattered Churches,
which would manifestly be a work of time.

“Thus, Titus was left at Crete in the same position which Timotheus had
occupied at Ephesus during St. Paul's recent absence; and there would,
consequently, be the same advantage in his receiving written directions
from St. Paul concerning the government and organization of the Church
... Accordingly, shortly after leaving Crete, St. Paul sent a letter to
Titus, the outline of which would equally serve for that of the
preceding Epistle [1 Timothy].

“But St. Paul's letter to Titus seems to have been still further called
for, to meet some strong opposition which that disciple had encountered
while attempting to carry out his master's directions. This may be
inferred from the very severe remarks against the Cretans which occur in
the Epistle, and from the statement, at its commencement, that the very
object which its writer had in view, in leaving Titus in Crete, was that
he might appoint Presbyters in the Cretan Churches; an indication that
his claim to exercise this authority had been disputed.

“This epistle seems to have been dispatched from Ephesus at the moment
when St. Paul was on the eve of departure on a westward journey, which
was to take him as far as Nicopolis (in Epirus) before the winter.”

[End of Conybeare and Howson quotation.]

One of the most interesting and useful features of the Epistle to Titus
is what it teaches about the Christian way of life. The letter serves as
a succinct outline of the obligations for holy living, devotion to God,
and love and graciousness toward other people. The examples of the
spiritual character of godly church leaders, gracious and grace-filled
Christian senior citizens, and serious and motivated young people, are
as clearly drawn here as anywhere else in the Bible.

This epistle is a good place to learn a great deal about God's plan for
your life, and why the Lord requires certain thinking and behavior from
believers.

For example, the young woman of chapter 2 is to be taught certain
specific things (by the older woman). The things she learns will
certainly help her in her daily life with her husband and children. But
the most important thing is that her life be such a testimony that “the
word of God be not slandered”!

Titus himself is told to be an example, that “he that is in opposition
have no evil thing to say of you”. Not that you can keep people from
talking, but the idea is not to give them ammunition.

They the servant is given commands about his work for his master, to be
obedient, not to talk back, not to steal. Why? Not just that he may be a
good witness to his employer, but that he may “adorn the gospel” of the
Lord!

So, “how then am I to live, Lord?” If I follow these three principles,
that my life brings no disrepute on the Lord, gives enemies no evil
thing to say, and decorates the Gospel - well, that's pretty hard to
slide around!

And suppose you have a decision to make about some activity that you are
planning, whether it is in the Lord's will. Just apply the principles of
Titus 2 to help make the decision. Does the activity bring slander on
God, does it give enemies of the Gospel something to criticize, does it
“adorn the Gospel”? This makes it a lot easier to make decisions in gray
areas.

In this study we will take a close view of each word and statement. But
there is a “near field” and a “far field” approach to the Word of God.
We must study microscopically; but we must then zoom out, use our
peripheral vision, to see the landscape of the whole context of
Scripture. And the memory work I suggested was aimed at helping us keep
our minds on the overall context.

Here are some of the aims of this Titus series:

To learn how Christians are supposed to operate in the Christian life.

To see some things about the operation of a local church, such as how
church leaders are identified and qualified.

To observe how certain serious church problems are handled, particularly
involving false teaching and sins of the tongue.

To gain an insight into the character, background, and motivation of
Christian Jews of the 1st Century, who were struggling mightily with how
to correlate their ancient Judaic teachings and practices with the new
Christian doctrines they were being asked to consider.

To examine the relationships between Jewish and Gentile Christians in an
environment of polar extremes in culture. This study will help in
understanding other New Testament books (such as Romans and Galatian\~)
where the Jewish and Gentile cultures collide.

Titus, Chapter 1
================

Titus 1:1
---------

**Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is
after godliness;**

“Paul”: the Apostle, author of this letter. This in one of the pastoral
epistles written late in Paul's ministry. He had recently been on the
island of Crete with Titus and had departed, leaving Titus with a
difficult but a very necessary mission, to begin the establishing and
building up of local churches on Crete.

### Topic: Paul

“a servant of God”: (**doulos theou**) “a slave belonging to God”
(genitive of possession). Paul was bent to God's authority and basked in
His sovereignty. In the preamble of several of his epistles Paul calls
himself the servant of Christ; only here does he write “servant of God.”
There doesn’t seem to be any particular reason for the difference; he
undoubtedly understood that to be a servant of Christ was to be a
servant of God, in any case.

### Topic: Servants

#### “and an apostle of Jesus Christ”

The word “apostle” (**apostolos**), means “an ambassador; a delegated
authority; envoy; messenger; the commander of a naval force” The word
was used for high-ranking naval officers in classical Greek times.

From **stolos** , “military equipment or armament; military expedition;
journey or voyage.” Comes from the idea of a tail of an animal; so the
military equipment caravan or convoy follows the troops as they move
forward. So **apostolos******is a stronger form of this word.

I Kings 14:5,6. God sent the prophet Abijah to Jeroboam’s wife, with a
message, “for I am sent to thee (**apostolos**). This is the only noun
form in the Septuagint, but the verb form **apostello** is used
extensively. The concept throughout the Greek is that the apostle was a
passive envoy for a higher power; that is, he did not carry his own
message and he was not proactive in directing the military forces. He
was like a naval officer who is carrying out the battle plan of a higher
headquarters.

Herodotus V.XXXviii, “Coes, when the Mytilenaeans received him, was
taken out and stoned, but the Cymaeans, as well as most of the others,
let their own man go. In this way, then, an end was made of tyrants in
the cities. After doing away with the tyrants, Aristagoras of Miletus
ordered all the peoples to set up governors in each city. Then he went
on an embassy (**apostolos**) in a trireme to Lacedaemon, for it was
necessary for him to find some strong ally.”

An apostle of Jesus Christ was the highest ranking official among the
Christian churches of the first century, 1 Cor. 12:28.

Apostles of Jesus Christ were appointed by God the Father for the
purpose of establishing churches and spreading new truth, Eph. 3:1-10.

There were both the spiritual gift and office of apostleship. The
spiritual gift was the divine enabling to function as an apostle, Eph.
4:11, 1 Cor. 28,29.

The office of apostleship was the authority to function as an apostle,
Rom. 1.5, ACTS 1:25, GAL. 2:8.

#### The Qualification of an Apostle

An apostle had to have the spiritual gift of apostleship. The gift was
provided by Jesus Christ after His ascension into Heaven, Eph. 4:8-11.
The gift was imparted by the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, 1 Cor.
12:11; Acts 2.

The apostle received his gift and office by the sovereign decision of
God the Father, 1 Cor. 1:1; 12:18; Eph. 1:1; Col. 1:1.

The apostle had to have been an eyewitness of the resurrected Lord, Acts
1:22; 1 Cor. 9:1.

#### The Credentials of an Apostle

An apostle was endowed with miraculous powers of miracles, Heb. 2:4; 2
Cor. 12:12.

An apostle had success in evangelism, 1 Cor. 9:2; 2 Cor. 3:1-3; Gal.
2:7-9.

An apostle had the capacity to suffer patiently, 2 Cor. 12:12.

#### The Function of an Apostle

Apostles received and communicated new revelation, Eph. 3:2-6.

Apostles communicated the gospel effectively and people accepted Christ
in response to their preaching, 1 Cor. 9:1; Gal. 2:7-9.

Apostles helped organize local churches and appointed officers, Acts
14:23; Tit. 1:5.

Apostles trained new believers in doctrine, 1Thess. 1:5 to 2:12.

Apostles had the authority to administer discipline to believers, Acts
5:1-10; 1 Tim. 1:20; 1 Cor. 4:21; 2 Cor. 13:2.

“according to the faith”: (**kata**), a preposition of criterion or
standard, followed by (**pistis**), “belief; faith”. “Faith is the
substance of that in which we have complete confidence (hoped for), the
evidence of things not seen.”

[Faith and Hope (confidence) are closely linked. See the topical study
on Hope.]

“of God's elect”: The elect are those who are chosen as the recipient of
special privilege”. [An English cognate is “eclectic”, from Greek
(**eklektos**)].

Note carefully Eph. 1:3-11. We are chosen in Him and united with Him.
These verses in Ephesians show the privileges and responsibilities of
our union with the Lord Jesus Christ.

“and the acknowledging”: (**epignosis**), A better translation, seen in
the NAS and NIV, is “and the knowledge”, not just a simple
acknowledgement, but full and applied knowledge in the believer's soul.

As Christians, we just not only understand the gospel academically, we
must also make it a part of our lives by accepting Christ by faith. And
the Holy Spirit has given us spiritual discernment regarding the facts
of the gospel.

(**epignosis**) is the result of a process which begins when a Christian
learns academically (**gnosis****)** a principle of Scripture. Then,
when the person accepts the truth of what he has learned and makes
application of it, spiritual growth, or edification, takes place.

Application is a matter of believing Scripture, obeying the commands,
and claiming the promises, which God has put in His word.

In this manner, over a lifetime of learning Bible truth, a Christian is
edified, “line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, there a
little.”

For a contrast, see Rom. 1:28 ff on the results of negative volition to
(**epignosis****)**.

“of the truth”: (**aleitheia**), the Greek grammar indicates that the
believer's applied knowledge is from the source of truth. Full and
applied knowledge comes from the source of the Word of God. This refers
to Bible teaching learned accurately and categorically under the
unhindered teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit to provide spiritual
discernment.

The Word of God is TRUTH!

The Lord Jesus said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, no man
comes unto the Father but by me” (John 14:6) Any desire to be occupied
with Christ, and to serve Him, must be accompanied by a great desire for
the truth, the Word of God. The acquiring of truth must be the highest
priority.

There are many Bible passages that deal with the concept of truth; here
is a sampling:

Psalm 86:11, “Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth; unite
my heart to fear thy name.

Psalm 119:72, “The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of
gold and silver.” Also Psalm 119:127,162.

Prov. 23:23, “Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and
instruction, and understanding.”

Examples of eagerness for truth:

The temple worshippers:

Luke 21:37, 38 “Now during the day He was teaching in the temple, but at
evening He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called
Olivet. And all the people would get up early in the morning to come to
Him in the temple to listen to Him.

The Samaritans:

John 4:39-42, “And from that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him
because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all the
things that I have done.” So when the Samaritans came to Him, they were
asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. And many
more believed because of His word; and they were saying to the woman,
“It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have
heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of the
world.”

Cornelius:

Acts 10:30-33 And Cornelius said, “Four days ago to this hour, I was
praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood
before me in shining garments, and he said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has
been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. Send therefore
to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he
is staying at the house of Simon the tanner by the sea.' “And so I sent
to you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we
are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded
by the Lord.”

The Bereans:

Acts 17:10-13, “And the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by
night to Berea; and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of
the Jews. Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica,
for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the
Scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so. Many of them
therefore believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and
men. But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God
had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there likewise,
agitating and stirring up the crowds.

Other passages to read:

Col. 1:9-23; 2:1-8

Eph. 1:17-23; 3:14-19; 4:11-16.

“which is after godliness”: or “according to a standard of godliness”,
(**kata eusebeia**), “inner piety; spirituality”.

Robertson, A. T.: “with a view to godliness”, which ATR says is a common
idiom in the use of **kata**. Similarly, Gill. So that the truth of God
“produces” godliness, or “promotes piety toward God.”

### Topic: Godliness

Summary:

Paul carried out his duties as an apostle according to the standard of
the faith of Christian believers, according to the full and applied
knowledge which he had of the Word of God. And from that standard for
truth he ministered according to a character of inner piety.

Translation: Paul, a servant of God, and a messenger of Jesus Christ,
according to the standard of the faith of God’s elect, and the applied
knowledge of the truth.

Titus 1:2
---------

**In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before
the world began;**

“in hope” : (**elpis**) - “utmost confidence; expectation” This phrase
fits with the preceding verse. There is confidence in eternal life --
there is confidence in the plan of God -- this confidence springs up in
the life of the believer who has a full and applied knowledge of the
Word of God, the Truth.

“Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.”

Read Rom. 5:1-5 (growth in confidence)

Read Titus 2:11-15 (confidence supports authority)

### Topic: Hope

“of eternal life”: life everlasting.

“which God that cannot lie”: (**ho apseudeis theos**), “the non-lying
God”

This phrase deals with the Veracity of God. God never lies. God always
deals honestly with people, He always speaks straight. We may not like
the information we get from God, but we can have confidence in what He
says.

The Veracity of the Godhead:

Veracity of the Father - Psa. 31:5; Isa. 65:16; Jer. 10:10; John 3:33;
17:3; Rom. 3:4

Veracity of the Son - John 1:14; 8:32; 14:6; 1 John 5:20; Rev. 16:7;
19:11

Veracity of the Holy Spirit - John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6

Application of God's Veracity to the Christian - Prov. 6:16,17; Matt.
5:37; 2 Tim. 2:15; 1 John 4:6

Why would Paul tell Titus that God does not lie? After all, this is the
man whom Paul appointed troubleshooter in Crete, so he was as well
trained and doctrinally informed as any of Paul's colleagues. Answer:
“The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons...”

Lying was the way of life of the Cretans. They were the world's best
story tellers. They were habitual, congenital liars -- so much so that a
Greek word (**kreitimadzo**), “to Cretanize”, meant “to lie like a
Cretan”, to tell a whopper.

Imagine trying to teach the Bible to a Cretan. Habitual liars have one
thing in common; they don't believe anyone else. They would have thought
that a teacher was lying to them. And they were already being lied to by
false teachers who were out for their money (see later in chapter 1).

So it was necessary to emphasize the fact that God is perfect Veracity.

“promised”: (**epavggellw**), a Greek verb for a contractual promise;
hence, “to promise to undertake something, to underwrite something”

Read Romans 4:20-25

“before the world began”: This is provision for every detail of life,
which God planned completely in eternity past.

Eph. 1:3, We are “...chosen in Him before the foundation of the world.”

So, Paul is saying that his ministry is according to faith,
characterized by godliness, and from a mental attitude of complete
confidence in eternal life, which an absolutely truthful God had
promised from before man was even created.

Titus 1:3
---------

**But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is
committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Savior:**

This verse shows that the method for communicating the “truth” of verse
1 and the “promise” of verse 2 is by means of “preaching”.

“But hath manifested”: (**fanerow**) “to reveal; to make known; to show;
to teach; to pass on by word of mouth”.

In the Greek of 100 A.D. this word was used both for written and oral
communication.

“in due times” (**kairois idiois**): “his own time”, referring to God's
own time, a technical phrase used to mark differences in divine
administration.

“his word”: (**logos**), the Word of God, the Truth the Bible, the Mind
of Christ.

“through preaching”: (**keirugma**), “by means of heralding; public
teaching; inculcation”

### Topic: Preaching

“which is committed unto me”: (**pisteuo**), aor. ind. pass., from the
same root as “faith”. Here it means “entrusted”. The word of truth, the
preaching ministry, is entrusted by God to Paul.

Compare: Gal. 2:7 \*\*; 1 Thess. 2:4; 1 Tim. 1:11

“according to the commandment” (**kat’ epitagei**) This word is used in
ancient Greek to refer to a divine command. Here it is meant that the
one who preaches is strictly accountable to God and operates under
strict rules in his teaching.

“of God our Savior”: a reminder that the basis of our stability is Jesus
Christ seated at the right hand of the Father. He represents us in
heaven; our position is “in Christ”.

The Lord revealed His word to Paul at the proper time and entrusted to
him the task of preaching the truth, holding him accountable to Himself
as God and Savior.

Titus 1:4
---------

**To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and
peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.**

“to Titus”: the recipient of the epistle.

Facts concerning Titus:

He was a Gentile, Gal. 2:3.

In Galatians 2:3, Titus is called a Greek, and it is certain from that
passage that he had not been circumcised. The probability is, that up to
the time of his conversion he had lived as other Gentiles, and had not
been converted to the Jewish faith. His father and mother were,
doubtless, both Greeks, and thus he was distinguished from Timothy,
whose mother was a Jewess, but whose father was a Greek; Acts 16:3. If
Titus had been a proselyte of the Jewish faith, it is to be presumed
that he would have been circumcised.

Paul introduces this case of Titus (Gal. 2:3) undoubtedly to show that
circumcision was not necessary for salvation. It was a case in point. He
had gone up to Jerusalem with the express reference to this question.
Here was a man whom he had admitted to the Christian church without
circumcising him. He claimed that he had a right to do so; and that
circumcision was not necessary in order for salvation. If it were
necessary, it would have been proper that Titus should have been
compelled to submit to it. But Paul that says this was not demanded; or
if demanded by anyone, the point was yielded, and he was NOT compelled
to be circumcised.

It is to be remembered that this was at Jerusalem; that it was a case
submitted to the apostles there; and that consequently the determination
of this case settled the whole controversy about the obligation of the
Mosaic laws on the Gentile converts. It is quite evident from the whole
statement here that Paul did not intend that Titus should be
circumcised; that he maintained that it was not necessary; and that he
resisted it when it was demanded; Galatians 2:4,5.

Yet on another occasion he himself performed the act of circumcision
upon Timothy, Acts 16:3. But there is no inconsistency in Paul’s
conduct. In the case of Titus, it was demanded as a matter of right and
as obligatory upon him, and Paul resisted the principle as (being
contrary to Grace). In the case of Timothy, it was a voluntary
compliance on his part with the usual customs of the Jews, where it was
not pressed as a matter of obligation, and where it would not be
understood as indispensable to salvation. No danger would follow from
compliance with the custom, and it might do much to conciliate the favor
of the Jews, and he therefore submitted to it. Paul would not have
hesitated to have circumcised Titus in the same circumstances in which
it was done to Timothy; but the circumstances were different; and when
it was insisted upon as a matter of principle and of obligation, it
became a matter of principle and of obligation with him to oppose it.

He was a beloved friend and helper of Paul, 2 Cor. 2:13; 7:6,13.

Paul had led Titus to Christ, so that he could call him “my own son
after the faith.” It is not know how or when this occurred.

He was a messenger of the church of Corinth, 2 Cor. 8:16-18.

He was a companion of Paul and Barnabas on a journey to Jerusalem, Gal.
2:1

Titus went with Paul to Jerusalem when he was deputed by the church at
Antioch with Barnabas, to lay certain questions before the apostles and
eiders there in reference to the converts from the Gentiles; Acts 15;
compare Galatians 2:1. It is not known why he took Titus with him on
that occasion. Possibly he was taken with him to Jerusalem because his
was a case in point in regard to the question which was to come before
the apostles and elders there. From an expression which Paul uses in
describing his visit there - “neither was Titus compelled to be
circumcised “ - that the case probably came up for discussion, and that
strenuous efforts were made by the Judaizing (legalistic) faction there
(cf. Galatians 2:4), to have him circumcised. Paul and Barnabas,
however, so managed the affair that the principle was settled that it
was not necessary that converts from the heathen should be circumcised;
Acts 15:19,20.

He was assigned as missionary pastor to Crete by Paul, Titus 1:5

He was in Rome with Paul during Paul's second imprisonment, 2 Tim. 4:10

Titus was a man of sturdy character, a very mature believer. He was
tough in his mental attitude, indicated by the nature of the task he was
assigned.

On Crete there are some traditional recollections of Titus. One Greek
legend says that he was the nephew of a pro-consul of Crete, another
that he was a descendant of King Minos. The cathedral of Megalo-Castron
on the north of the island was dedicated to him. Titus's name was the
watchword of the Cretans when fighting against the Venetians during the
Dark Ages.

In one of the prayers in Latin in the Greek Orthodox church on Crete
there is the phrase “*Sancte Tite, tu nou adjuva*”, “St. Titus, pray for
us.”

“my own son”:

This phrase sparked some debate in times past as to whether Titus was
the natural son of Paul. Some have stated that Paul was married and
Titus was his son. Others say that Titus was the illegitimate son of
Paul. We can lay this to rest by reference to Gal. 2:3, which states
that Titus was Greek and was criticized for not being circumcised as an
adult in order to avoid offense to Judaizers. If he had been Paul's son,
he would not have been Greek; and he would already have been circumcised
as an infant.

The phrase refers to Titus position as the spiritual son of Paul.

“after the common faith”: (**kata koinein pistin**), “according to the
faith common” to all believers. Titus was Paul's spiritual son in the
sense that Paul led Titus to Christ (probably) and discipled him.

“grace and peace” (**charis kai eireinei**): a common greeting in
letters of all sorts in Roman times.

Some manuscripts have, “grace, mercy, and peace”. These later
manuscripts are used by more modern versions such as the NAS and NIV,
but majority of the texts seem to support the KJV.

But grace and peace is ...

“from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.”

Titus 1:5
---------

**For this cause I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the
things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had
appointed you.**

“for this cause”: (**toutou charin**), “because of this grace”, the
grace mentioned in verse 4. Titus is to operate on grace principles in
dealing with the most ungracious mob of Christians in the known world.
(The Greek has the word “grace”, while the KJV leaves it out, probably
because the translator thought the reference to v. 4 was obvious. I
think it should have been re-emphasized in English. wd ]

“left I thee”: “I left you behind”

Paul was Titus's last link to the rational society of grace believers,
and now this link was being cut. He was a missionary in the truest sense
of the word.

“in Crete”:

### Topic: Crete

“that you should set in order”: (**epidiorthovomai**), “to set right; to
correct; to mend a situation”

This is a situation requiring the exercise of authority. Paul has
delegated apostolic authority (authority over more than one local
church) to Titus to deal with people who acknowledge no authority. And
Titus is to get things started in the right direction.

“the things that are wanting”: (**leipw**), “the things that are
deficient, lacking, that fall short”.

NOTE WELL:

The discussion in this Epistle, of the methods that Titus is to use to
correct the problems among the believers in local churches on Crete, is
one of the most important in the New Testament with regard to solving
problems among believers.

There were many problems on Crete requiring authoritative action: false
teaching, maligning and gossip, cultural clashes, Judaism, etc. The
first chapter uses some extreme language to describe troublemakers and
those whose “mouths must be stopped”. As we will see, stopping the
mouths of those who were against sound teaching was equivalent to
putting a bit in a horse's mouth and hauling back!

What is “wanting” on Crete? Everything! And how is Titus going to go
about putting things in order? By Bible teaching -- every day in the
towns and villages of Crete. And he is going to find men of godly
character who would “hold fast the faithful word as they have been
taught”.

The people lack knowledge and application of Bible principles.
Therefore, there is no faith-rest (trust leading to peace), no
orientation to grace, no knowledge of how to use armor of God, and so
forth.

Added to this were the cultural problems peculiar to Cretans, along with
religious problems associated with both false teachers and Judaism.

“and ordain”: (**kathisteimi**), “to appoint, to put in charge, to set,
to approve”

“elders”: (**presbuteroi**), literally, “old men”; however, here
referring to maturity from the standpoint of both experience and wisdom.
The next few verses of Titus make plain what type of person is meant.

(**presbuteros****)** is used in general language to refer to “the older
of the two”, or the older of two generations.

Used with definite article (**presbuteros****)** refers to “the
ancestors”. However, this group of words did not carry any negative
implications such as loss of powers, etc.

Officials at local city or village councils were called
(**presbuteroi**). They had administrative and judicial functions. The
members were not necessarily older men. Various texts refer to
(**presbuteroi**) of 45, 35, and even 30 years of age.

Officers of Jewish synagogues before 70 A.D. were known as
(**presbuteroi**).

Certain members of the Sanhedrin were called (**presbuteroi**).

The English words “presbyter”, “Presbyterian”, and “priest” derive from
(**presbuteros**).

(When I was in my early forties, I had to get new eyeglasses. The doctor
said I had “presbyopia”, old man's eyes! Tsk.)

Comment: Christian leadership emerges from the ranks. Most churches in
the New Testament times found their pastors within their own ranks; and
the gift was recognizable by the people in the congregation. This can be
compared with the manner in which deacons were chosen at first. Seven
men were chosen who were obviously controlled by the Holy Spirit; by
their fruit they were known.

“in every city”: (**kata polis**), “according to each city”

Titus's job was to go from town to town, appointing pastors to take care
of the need for “feeding” in each city. He had to identify those who had
the communication gifts and enough doctrinal background to be ready for
training. Then, he had to train them and assign them to their posts.

Note that Titus is not commanded to import pastors. He must find the
best man in each locality, train him, and appoint him.

“as I have appointed thee”: (**diatassw**), “to arrange; to prescribe;
to direct; to command”.

Paul had given Titus detailed orders concerning church policy and
organization - a precise and detailed set of plans which took into
account the character of the people. Titus was directed to carry out the
plans for organizing the churches on Crete.

Titus 1:6
---------

**If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children
not accused of riot or unruly.**

Titus 1:6-16 contain Paul's directions to Titus regarding basic church
order and discipline. Note the need for firm and authoritative
management of the affairs of the church in Crete.

1:6-9, character and qualifications of elders and bishops

1:10,11, the duty of suppressing those who would teach for money

1:12-14, the evil character of the Cretans which demands stern treatment
and steadfast adherence to the truth

1:15,16, the condemnation of inward defilement and hypocrisy

“if any”: In the Greek, a first-class conditional statement, meaning
that the conditional statement is assumed to be true.

Paul assumes that Titus will be able to find those who qualify as
elders. Paul may already have been somewhat acquainted with the people
during his own stay on Crete and noticed that there were some emerging
leaders.

The churches on Crete were not necessarily new ones. There had been
Christians on Crete since the Day of Pentecost, some 35 or so years
previous.

“blameless”: (**anegkleitos**), the negative prefix with the adjective
meaning “chargeable; open to accusation in court”. Hence, this means,
“not chargeable with offense”, or, simply, “irreproachable”.

Col. 1:21,22, “and you...now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh
through death, to present you holy and \*blameless\* in his sight.”

1 Tim. 3:10 -- deacons are also to be blameless.

“the husband of one wife”: (**mias gunaikos aneir**), “a one-woman man”

The pastor must be monogamous. The pastor, if he is married, needs a
godly woman at his side.

“having faithful children”: or, “having children who are believers”,
children of Christian faith, rather than, simply, loyal or respectful
children.

Unbelieving children, in their older childhood and teenage years, can be
a source of pressure and great suffering in a pastor's life. They can
even force him out of the ministry; or, as here, keep him from starting
it.

Well-behaved, godly children are a great example of the power of the
Word of God. They are evidence that the pastor and his wife have taught
the word in the home consistently and have lived for the Lord before
their children.

“not accused of riot”: (**kateigoria**), “accusation” “categorization”,
plus (**asoteis**), “dissipation, excess, reckless living”. Hence, “not
accused of reckless living; not profligate, dissolute, disorderly”.

Eph. 5:18, “Be not drunk with wine, wherein is \*excess\* ...”

READ 1 Peter 4:3-5

“or unruly”: (**anupotaktos**), “insubordinate”.

There are quite a number of warnings to children to “honor” their
parents, from the ten commandments to Ephesians 6. The commands to
children are accompanied by a promise “that it may be well with you and
that you may live long on the earth”.

This sound rather benign, but it carries some very serious overtones.
You may recall that in Old Testament times among the Jews, older
children who “cursed” their parents or were otherwise implacable were
liable to death by stoning!

And notice in Romans 1, right in the middle of that long list of
terrible sins of those who reject God, is “disobedient to parents”.

In the Bible, proper response to parental authority is extremely
important. Keep in mind that the transmission of Bible doctrine and the
Christian way of life from one generation to the next is possible only
in stable families.

If parents go astray, they will fail to communicate the Word of God to
their offspring, and there will be serious reverberations in their
progeny, the “sins of the fathers being visited upon the third and
fourth generation.”

Likewise, if children are negative, disobedient, implacable, they will
fail to receive good teaching and will interrupt the process of the
communication of divine truth to future generations.

Both negative parents and negative children are the worst kind of
stumbling blocks. And there are plenty of examples in Scripture of the
Lord taking swift and severe action against those who hinder the gospel
or who cause unbelievers or weaker brethren to be offended.

Examples are Ananias and Sapphira and Herod, among others. And remember
Christ's admonition not to prevent the little children from coming to
him, and warning that “it would be better that a millstone be hanged
around his neck ... than that he should cause one of these little ones
to stumble.”

All of this emphasizes how important it is in a pastor's family that
both the father (the pastor) and the children be yielded to God's
authority.

Titus 1:7
---------

**For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God, not
self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, not a striker, not given
to filthy lucre.**

“for a bishop”: (**episkopos**), “overseer”.

This is a word denoting authority; used for someone who is functioning
as a leader; used of persons who have a definite office within a group.
This word was quite commonly used in Greek to refer to temple officials,
for example

Acts 20:28, “Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
over which the Holy Spirit hath made you \*overseers\*, to feed the
church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know
this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you,
not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking
perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch...”

Therefore, in the local church, the bishop was a man with official
duties including teaching and shepherding; in our own parlance, the
pastor.

### Topic: Shepherds of the Flock of God

READ 1 Tim. 3:1-7

“must be”: “it is necessary”. Therefore, “It is necessary for a bishop
to be...”. All of the characteristics below are necessary qualifications
for the overseer.

“blameless”: (**anegkleitos**), [ see above in verse 6 ]

“as the steward”: (**oikonomos**), “an administrator with authority; the
manager of an estate”

“of God”: the possessive case, “a steward belonging to God”

“not self-willed”: (**authadeis**), “stubborn, arrogant”. See 2 Pet.
2:10.

The pastor cannot allow self will, stubbornness, or antagonism toward
people to move him to the place where he is unfair. He is to express
grace, even to those who deserve condemnation. He must be oriented to
grace.

The pastor must maintain objectivity. A stubborn, implacable man cannot
do so. The pastor will be criticized, sometimes justly, sometimes not.
The criticism does not necessarily constitute judging or maligning. But
criticism cannot be allowed to cause antagonism on his part, so he must
have grace orientation. Personal feelings or prejudice must never
destroy his fairness in dealing with a situation.

“not soon angry”: (**orgilos**), “not quick tempered” Anger from a quick
temper is mental attitude sin. The pastor must have a relaxed mental
attitude which leads to a quick recovery from anger.

Prov. 14:17, “He that is soon angry deals foolishly...”

Prov. 15:18, “A wrathful man stirs up strife; but he that is slow to
anger appeases strife.”

### Topic: Anger

The elder who is to be appointed to a church on Crete must turn matters
over to the Lord and maintain a non-judgmental, objective outlook.

“not given to wine”: (**paroinos**), “not addicted to drunkenness”. This
refers to using alcohol as a form of sublimation. The edified man,
mature in Christ, has such happiness (+H) and peace every day that he
doesn't need to sublimate or forget it all.

There are several reasons given in the Bible not to drink wine. First,
one is not to drink in order to get drunk, Eph. 5:18. A person's mind
must be unclouded and always open to the controlling and teaching
ministry of the Holy Spirit.

Then, a person is not to drink if it would be offensive to others, 1
Cor. 10:31; Rom. 14:21. This is the Law of Love superseding the Law of
Liberty; the outworking of impersonal love and burden for the lost and
untaught.

Prov. 31:4,5 “It is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong
drink: lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of
any of the afflicted.”

It is apparent that any person in a position of social or spiritual
responsibility is not to be given to wine or strong drink, including
elders, deacons, and mature women (Titus 2:3)

“not a striker”: (**pleikteis**), “bully, pugnacious man, brawler”

This is not a reference to self defense. A bully is a man who seeks out
fighting and brawling. But an elder can ruin his ministry by starting a
fight.

“not given to filthy lucre”: (**aiscrokerdeis**), “not eager for
dishonorable profit; not greedy for material gain.”

This is a reference to Mastery of the Details of Life by the mature
believer who is no longer part of the “Rat Race” for this world's goods.
When a Christian is a master of the details of life (rather than a slave
to them), he can enjoy the things in his life when he has them, but when
they are taken away, his happiness (joy) is not disturbed, because his
joy depends on God's faithfulness, not on personal possessions, social
life, or status.

The pastorate is not a career. It is not a salaried position (although
he might receive a salary). It is not a job for yuppies, those who are
upwardly mobile, status conscious, world-changers. It is not a track to
national prominence or even local prominence. It is not a position from
which a man can satisfy his ambition, or stroke his lust for
approbation, or solidify his power base.

Titus 1:8
---------

**But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,
temperate.**

“but”: a conjunction of contrast: there is a change here, from dealing
with negative characteristics to be avoided, to the positive aspects
that are characteristics of the edified believer, and that must be found
in church leadership.

“a lover of hospitality”: (**philozenos**), literally, “having a love
for strangers”

This word carries the connotation of hospitality, of doing something for
someone who does not earn or deserve the good treatment, because there
has been no previous acquaintance. This word reflects a Grace attitude
toward people who have not yet earned your consideration.

This is a word of impersonal love - the type of attitude that is free of
arrogance, envy, hatred, or even disdain for other people, even if there
is sharp disagreement about doctrine or practice. This is the type of
love that permits a Christian to love even his enemies or people that he
doesn't like.

This is the type of love that is the fruit of the Holy Spirit. It does
not come from emotion, although it may cause emotion. This is the
“professional” love of the mature Christian believer, analogous to the
Love of God, the quality of which does not depend on the behavior or
character of the one being loved, but on the character of the one who
loves.

“a lover of good men”: (**philagothos**), “one who loves good”.

The idea of “good men” probably derives from the fact that sometimes
adjectives are used by themselves to indicate a class of people. We say
“the rich” when we mean “the rich people”, or “the infirm” when we mean
“the infirm people”. Here, the adjective is “good”, which could mean
“good people”, hence, “one who loves good people”.

But the meaning could well be limited to only the adjective itself,
without regard to a class of people. In that case, the meaning would
change quite a bit. “Good” then would refer to that which has intrinsic
good, good in itself, and in this context it would refer to “divine
good”, and the translation would be “one who loves good”.

I've read various discussion on this, and I choose the latter meaning,
probably because the idea of love towards mankind (stranger\~) is
already paramount in the previous word.

[ If you are aware of studies that shed more light on this point, I
would appreciate hearing from you about it. wd ]

“sober”: (**sofron**), “prudent, thoughtful, discrete, self-controlled”.

When used of women in Titus 2:5, (**sofron**) is translated “discrete”
or “modest”.

This is a mental attitude of care for one's reputation, one's character,
a consideration of appearances. The verb form, (**sofroneo**), means “to
be of a sound mind”, so there is the connotation of mental stability.

READ Rom. 12:1-3 The transformation leading to mental stability.

“just”: (**dikaios**), “righteous; fair; equitable”

The pastor must be fair, even-handed in all his actions. He must exhibit
the righteousness of God in the human life. He knows that the source of
righteousness is the Lord and is imputed without merit. Therefore he is
relaxed, not judgmental.

### Topic: Judgment, Justice, Judging

“holy”: (**hosios**), “kind, gracious, holy”.

This is NOT (**hagios**), “set apart, or sanctified”, which is a result
of our union with Christ.

This word for holiness has to do with an experiential inner result of
the work of the Lord in the life.

The candidate for Christian leadership must have an observable holiness.
He must be known for the fruit of the Spirit, just as the original seven
deacons were chosen for their obvious spiritual qualities and fruits.

These qualities are difficult to fake. Many people can put on a facade
of “holiness” or morality; but Titus is a discerning Christian, and he
has the responsibility to judge men in these matters.

He could tell whether a man loved the Word of God and was occupied with
Christ (viewing everything in life with Jesus Christ in mind). He could
observe a man who was going through some testing (minor or major) and
determine whether he knew how to trust God in situations and maintain
peace and joy in the midst of trials. He knew what to look for, and
could size someone up very quickly.

“temperate”: (**egkrateis**), “self-restrained”; a master of the details
of life.

You either have control over the details of life, or they control you.

Examples: Jer. 35:6; Dan. 1:8

Titus 1:9
---------

**Holding fast the faith word, as he has been taught, that he might be
able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and to convince the
gainsayers.**

In this verse there are some operational standards for the man appointed
to the office of pastor (elder, bishop), the new recruit that Titus will
ordain. This verse shows how rebellious and unruly Christians are to be
handled.

Note that it is not Titus's job to come into town with a big stick to
personally chastise the lying, rioting, deceiving, subversive believers.
In fact, he's not going to do the job at all, because he will not stay
on the island long enough.

The new recruit is to be the teacher. Month after month, year after
year, the man who has emerged as a community spiritual leader will
patiently instruct, encourage, exhort, convince -- by using the Word of
God either to convince those with positive volition or to close the
mouths of the implacable. The principle is that Bible teaching is the
instrument of bringing change into people's lives. The opposition will
either capitulate to doctrine, or they will be forced to leave.

“holding fast”: (**antecomai**), “to cling to something; to hold fast
to; to be devoted to”

That which is “held fast” is sound doctrine. The verb is in the Greek
middle voice, which is reflexive, that is, the subject acts upon itself.
Thus, the believer is holding something fast for himself.

Heb. 4:14 “Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast (**antecomai**)
our profession.”

Heb. 10:23 “Let us hold fast (**antecomai**) the profession of our faith
without wavering.”

“the faithful word”: (**pistos + logos**), “the trustworthy word; the
dependable word”, that which inspires trust, The Word of God.

“as he hath been taught”: (kata tein didascei), “according to the
instruction; teaching; doctrine”.

“that he might be able”: (**eimi + dunatos**), “might be capable”.

Strength after the flesh, that is, human strength, is not enough. The
teacher's ability is the result of clinging to doctrine.

1 Cor. 1:26 “For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise
men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:”

“by sound doctrine”: (**didaskalia + hugiaino**), “by means of
uncorrupted doctrine” .

(**hugiaino**) “uncorrupted” is repeated in 1:13; 2:1; 2:2; with
(**hugiaino**) in 2:8. It is used in the physical sense for good health;
in the Gospels and in 3 John v.2.

The doctrine the new pastor is to teach is uncorrupted, sharply
contrasted with other comments in this chapter about false teaching,
myths, commandments of men.

“both to exhort”: (**parakaleo**), “to exhort, to push, to stimulate”.

The Holy Spirit is called the Paraclete, and the Greek verb here has
several meanings in the Bible, including “to exhort” and “to comfort”.

Exhortation requires authority; Titus 2:15 “These things speak, and
exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.”

Exhortation requires great patience. 2 Tim. 4:2 “Preach the word; be
instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
longsuffering and doctrine.”

Exhortation requires persistence. Heb. 3:12,13 “Take heed, brethren,
lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from
the living God. But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today;
lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.”

Exhortation takes place in the local church environment. Heb. 10:23-25

“and to convince”: (**elegko**), “to bring to light; to expose; to
demonstrate; to convince; to reprove; to rebuke. Translated “rebuke” in
1:13 and 2:15; but even rebuking is by means of convincing argument from
the Scripture.

“the gainsayers”: (**antilego**), literally, “those who speak against;
those who contradict”; therefore, “those who are in opposition”.

Note the use in 2:9, servants are not to contradict or speak against
their masters.

READ Luke 2:34; 20:27

READ Romans 10:21 !!

Titus 1:10
----------

**For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially
they of the circumcision:**

“For there are many unruly”: (**anupotaktos**), “insubordinate;
undisciplined; rebellious; independent; not subject to authority”

There were many believers on Crete living in a state of spiritual
anarchy. These types are insubordinate to every type of authority and
are not used to the authority of God's Word and the pastor's teaching.

Three characteristics of revolt against doctrine are covered in this
verse;

​1. the unruly, or “the undisciplined”

​2. the vain talkers, or “those with empty arguments, and

​3. the deceivers, or “those who mislead others”.

The noun (**anupotaktos**) is translated “lawless” in 1 Tim. 1:9
“Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the
lawless and disobedient.”

Heb. 2:8 “Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in
that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put
under him . But now we see not yet all things put under him.”

There will be no insubordination to Jesus Christ!

“vain talkers”: (**mataiologos**), “empty argument; words without
content”. A combined word in the Greek, from (**mataios**) “empty” and
(**logos**) “word”. The old King James here, “vain”, referred to
“emptiness” (a few generations ago).

Solomon spoke of “vanity of vanities” in describing the empty life that
has all this world has to offer but does not have God.

Here, these people are expressing viewpoint from empty souls. These are
babes in Christ commenting on spiritual issues with which they are not
familiar either in principle or in practice.

People who would never think of criticizing an engineer or doctor or an
accountant, because they don't know those professions, seem to think
nothing of making judgment as experts in the plan of God. So you have
hundreds of opinions on child training, education, marriage, politics,
how to run a church. Imagine a person who can't add fractions telling a
mathematics professor that his explanation of a calculus problem is
wrong.

Prov. 29:11 “A fool utters all his mind; but a wise man keeps it in
until afterwards.”

1 Tim. 6:20 “O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust,
avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of sciences falsely
so called.”

READ 1 Tim. 1:6,7 for reference to “vain janglings”, the old King James
word.

“and deceivers”: (**frenapateis**), “deceiver; misleader” The verb form
appears in Gal. 6:3 “For if a man think himself to be something, when he
is nothing, he \*deceives\* himself.”

READ Eph. 4:11-15 for the defense against being deceived.

The deceiver is a person that thinks that every man is king and that
what he thinks is correct. This category includes the legalist, the
moralist, the humanist, the one who is disoriented to the grace of God,
who, therefore, communicates false doctrine in opposition to the truth.

“specially they of the circumcision”: a reference to the Christian Jews
who were adamant about including the keeping of the Law as part of the
salvation package. Some of them were associated with the congregations,
but they insisted on mixing Law and Grace.

(Lest we criticize, however, remember that neither Titus not any other
believers in the 1st Century, Jewish or Gentile, had a copy of the
completed New Testament canon. Titus may have had some parchment copies
of some of Paul's writings, and there may have been one or more Torah
scrolls on the island. But imagine trying to understand the Christian
way of life with so little help!)

The Jew is very proud to be a Jew, and rightly so in many respects. But
he may also feel superior to Gentile believers, possibly because Jews
were among the earliest believers on Crete, some of them having been in
Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. Jews generally considered themselves
better than Gentiles, and the name “The Circumcision” was borne proudly.

READ Eph. 2:11-22. Christ has joined together the Jew and Gentile; but
the Judaizer wants no part of this. The Judaizer is not a Grace
believer, and he clings to his traditions with a grip of steel.

READ Rom. 2:17-29

There is an obvious need on Crete for crash programs of straight,
thorough teaching on Salvation, Grace, Positional Truth, and a hundred
other doctrines.

### Topic: Circumcision

### Topic: Union With Christ

Union with Christ (Positional Truth) is the title of the categories of
teachings about the Christian's union with Christ. I am including the
study here, even though this is not a passage dealing with union with
Christ. But union with Christ, and many aspects of the teaching of
Positional Truth, would have been understood by Titus, and could easily
have been used by him to point out to Jew and Gentile that both have
been united in Christ.

Titus 1:11
----------

**Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching
things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.**

“whose mouths must be stopped”: (**epistomizo**), “to stop the mouth; to
silence someone; to bridle; to muzzle”.

Hence, “whom it is necessary to silence”. It is imperative to teach
those who are negative. Believers who are in revolt against God's
authority, who will not obey, will only cause trouble among the
congregation. These types must be silenced. They must either keep quiet
and grow under the authority of the one teaching, or they must be
required to leave.

Matt. 22:34, Jesus Christ put the Sadducees to silence.

READ Titus 2:7,8

READ 1 Pet. 2:11-15

“who subvert”: (**anatrepo**), “to cause to fall; to overturn; to
destroy”

The colloquial meaning of the word is seen in the Oxyrhyncus Papyrii, P
Oxy I 69:2, “they broke down a door leading into the public street.” Or
in P Oxy VI 902:11, “I have been reduced to complete ruin .”

In this verse, the word is used in the sense of overturning something.

READ 2 Tim. 2:15-18 for the sense of turning something upside down
spiritually.

“whole houses”: (**holos oikos**), “entire households; whole houses”

This may be a reference to the fact that churches met in people's homes.
Hence, “they corrupt entire local churches”. Or, the phrase could refer
to “families”, households in the familial sense. Then this would say
“the corrupt entire families”. I have read discussions of both ideas,
and I have no objection to either.

Phil v.2 \*; 1 Cor. 16:19; Rom. 16:3-5; Col. 4:15

False teaching destroys a local church when it remains unchecked. The
false doctrine doesn't have to be something obviously heretical, such as
denying the deity of Christ, His resurrection, or the virgin birth. It
can simply be any human viewpoint about any doctrinal topic.

All believers have human viewpoint ideas; but when someone starts
promoting some such idea publicly in the congregation, it becomes
subversive.

Legalism, false teaching, human viewpoint, are the leaven which leavens
the whole lump. There must be strong emphasis from the pulpit to protect
the congregation from those who are vocal with false ideas.

“teaching”: (**didasko**), “public instruction”

“things which they ought not”: “things that are not proper”

...such as, giving advice from the human point of view from a platform
of pseudo-authority.

There will be believers who have been around a while and have built up a
following, a mutual admiration society. A mutual admiration society is a
group, small or large, who agree in some area of mental attitude sin,
usually associated with some form of sinful judging. These people will
pump each other up, using sins of the tongue, evil speaking, to try to
tear down the character or work of someone else not in the group.

Or, a vocal older believer will teach false ideas from a platform of
authority which the others in the group have allowed him to exercise.
This teaching may involve outright lies. Or it may involve partial truth
using scriptures outside of context. These will be mini-sermons which
sound good but which are false or lack content. So you get all types of
teaching on how to run the church, marriage, child training, law
keeping, legalism, along with every form of behavioral control from the
platform of a “busybody” (**allotroepiskopos**).

“for filthy lucre's sake”: “for the sake of dishonorable profit” There
were those on Crete who taught for money, dishonestly.

It seems that the Cretans had at least one thing straight; they paid the
Bible teachers for their time. “...money is held in such high honor
among them that its acquisition is not only regarded as necessary, but
as most honorable.” Cretans were very money oriented; they would not
think of asking someone to do some work without being paid well for his
efforts. Of course, this led to abuses...

Now, we know from scripture that those who minister might be supported
financially in their work. This concept is originally based on the
congregation in the wilderness, and in the promised land, caring for the
Levitical priesthood. For example, the meat offerings belonged to the
priests as part of their sustenance.

Titus 1:12
----------

**One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, “The Cretans are
always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.**

“One of themselves”: that is, a Cretan.

“a prophet of their own”:

The following quotation is thought by some scholars to be from the
Cretan poet Epimenides who lived in about the 6th Century B.C. He was
reputedly a prophet, or an oracle, and the author of political and
historical works. However, of all the works ascribed to him by
archaeologists, not one is certain to be his. Therefore, it is not
entirely certain that the line in this verse of Titus is that of
Epimenides.

Epimenides' life is mostly legend, anyway. According to Diogenes, he was
supposed to have fallen asleep in a cave and waked up after 57 years.
Later, the Athenians sent for him to purify their city from the plague
which was said to have been sent by the gods because of the murder of an
important person. Epimenides is credited with having lived a long life,
either 157 years or 299 years, depending on the source; and he is in a
list of seven ancient Greek wise men.

Plato called him “a divinely-inspired man”. Plutarch calls him, “A man
dear to the gods.” It is curious and unique to find a Greek writer
quoted here in the canon of Scripture. However, since divine viewpoint
is expressed, there is no reason to exclude this quotation. At any rate,
in 1:13 Paul corroborates the truth of the statement by saying, “This
witness is true...”

“said, The Cretans are always liars”: (**pseusteis**), “liar”.

The word here indicates the condition of mental sin which produces
habitual lying. An example of this is the systematic lying which
develops out of a person's desire for the praise of others, such as
bragging, tall tales, exaggeration. Lying includes the teaching of false
doctrine.

“evil beasts”: (**kakos thurion**), “an evil and brutish man”.

This Greek word was used in ancient times to refer either to an actual
wild beast or to a man with beastly tendencies. There are many things
which can cause a man to become brutish: alcoholism, drug addiction,
fornication, certain ingrained patterns of mental attitude sin, hatred,
revenge tactics, etc, all of which, it seems, were problems on Crete at
one time or another.

“slow bellies”: (**gastereis + argai**), “glutton who is averse to
labor; a lazy glutton”. Refers to a person with little or no
self-discipline. This is characteristic of some people without Bible
teaching.

“Slow bellies?” This old KJV verse rings with diction, anachronistic to
be sure, but this sort of language forces one to go to the Oxford
English Dictionary, to the certain joy of one who loves his language.

I have one of those editions of the OED which has all the material of
the previous edition squeezed into two volumes of microscopic, that is
to say, Lilliputian, text, for which I paid \$25 in some book club
introductory offer. I use a magnifying glass to read it. The latest
edition is about \$2,200 U.S., but I'm saving my shekels for the CD-ROM
version (about \$900).

Anyway, for an etymological adventure, look up “belly” in the OED, and
try to find out why the 1611 KJV translators used this phrase! I'd type
it out for your from my volume, but I have presbyopia (remember).

This verse shows that there is instability in every area of life on
Crete, such as can be seen in many areas of modern society as well.

Titus 1:13
----------

**This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be
sound in the faith;**

“This witness”: (**marturia**), “testimony; witness” [English cognate:
“martyr”] The apostle Paul is affirming the truth of the statement in
verse 12.

“is true”: (**aleitheis**), “true”.

This is the unqualified appraisal of the apostle Paul who speaks from
education, experience, and doctrinal orientation. Paul places the stamp
of approval on the Cretan poet's statement, even though the statement,
when originally written in about 600 B.C., was not inspired scripture.
The statement is divine viewpoint even though uttered by a pagan.

“wherefore, rebuke them”: (**elegko**), “to put to the proof; to refute;
to detect; to lay bare; to expose; to reprove”.

This statement, in context with v. 14, is directed at church members, at
the false teachers who are in the church and upsetting things. The elder
is the protector, the shepherd, of his own flock. Sometimes he will have
to confront those who are a direct threat to his congregation.

The teacher's weapon is the Word of God; he uses truth to refute lies.
In so doing he protects the flock.

“sharply”: (**apotomia**), an adverb, “cut off abruptly”

“that they may be sound in the faith”: (**hugiaino**) . Literally, “to
be in good health” In this context, however, it is their faith which is
to be uncorrupted. The stated purpose, them, of the very straightforward
teaching, the reproof, the rebuke, is the restoration of the errant
believer.

Titus 1:14
----------

**Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn
from the truth.**

The phrases which follow describe the doctrine of the false teachers, as
the previous verses have spoken of their character.

“not giving heed”: (**proseco**), “to apply the mind to; to consider; to
adhere to; to give one's self up to; to follow”

“to Jewish fables”: (**muthos**), “myths; tales; fables; figments”

This refers to the vast body of speculative or fictional literature
which exists in the apocryphal and pseudepigraphical writings of
Judaism. Some of this writing contains wise and helpful teaching. But
much of it tends “to minister questions rather than godly edifying which
is in faith”

To an uninformed group of Christians, very young in the faith, the
“fables” might well have seemed to be deep, esoteric truths. Sects that
build on such fictions have been with the church throughout its history,
intriguing and exciting the unstable and leading them astray.

Sayings like “the Lord helps them who help themselves” or “Everyone has
a divine spark in him” sound good, but they are not only not in the
Bible, but they are utterly false doctrine.

“and commandments of men”: (**entolei**), “an injunction; a precept; a
commandment”

Refers to human viewpoint admonition, exhortation, advice, taboos.

This passage is often used wrongly to excuse civil disobedience.

We are reminded of the Lord Jesus rebuking the Pharisees by quoting
Isaiah in Mark 7:7,8. “In vain do they worship me, teaching for
doctrines the commandments of men. For laying aside the commandments of
God, ye hold the tradition of men...”

It is part of human arrogance that we insist on adding our own rules and
regulations to the Word of God. Our intentions may be good. But our
uninspired extensions of the law often hinder the effectiveness of the
Word. The danger is very great in a situation like that on Crete where
the teachers were men who had turned from the truth, and what they teach
theoretically by their myths and fables they bring to bear practically
by means of their precepts.

“that turn”: (**apostrepho**), “to turn away; to remove; to incite to
revolt; to replace; to reject; to repulse; to desert”

READ 2 Tim. 4:2-4

“from the truth”: (**aleitheia**), “truth”; in this context, divine
viewpoint. “They that worship him must worship him in spirit and in
truth.”

When the Christian turns away from truth, he will naturally turn to
something. Usually that will be some pattern of thinking that is
non-biblical.

READ Heb. 2:1-4 a warning against letting go of the things we know to be
the truth.

READ 2 Pet. 1:16-19

READ 1 Tim. 4:1-7

We are great followers of fads. We have an insatiable desire for
entertainment, for amusement, for sublimation through occupying
ourselves with some activity. Some fads are harmless, like hula hoops or
pet rocks. But the unstable person is intrigued by something that is
new, exciting, and which appeals to his emotions.

So, religious fads, or hobbies, come in many varieties, depending upon
the group of people to which they appeal. In some religious fads there
is great pageantry, ceremonialism without content. In others, there is
emotionalism and mass psychology, the ecstatics of participation, such
as is found in music, politics, and religion. There are religious hobby
horses that are designed to make people emote rather than think.

But fads get boring. A person always wants to move on to new things. So
each religious fad or hobby burns itself out in the light of day. The
reality is that life continues on with its routine, drudgery, boredome,
suffering -- and the hobbies do not hold up. We can't live on the froth
of life.

The only sustaining commodity in life is the Truth of the Word of God.
“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out
of the mouth of God.

### Topic: Jewish Religious System

Titus 1:15
----------

**Unto the pure all things are pure; but unto them that are defiled and
unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is
defiled.**

“Unto the pure”: (**katharos**), the usual Greek word for purity,
referring to ceremonial purity of a physical object such as a vessel in
a temple, or of a person who is a worshipper, or of the spiritual nature
of a person.

Modern examples of ceremonial purification are Hindu purification rites
and washings when touched by someone who is inferior, such as a Moslem.
Lady Mountbatten examined the ring of a Maharajah; and he carefully
washed it before putting it back on.

Here, the word refers to a person who has been cleansed by some means.
In ancient Greece, the cleansing would have been by some ritual. In the
New Testament, there is a deeper meaning; it refers to the cleansing of
the soul by God. In this context, “purity” is a characteristic of a
believer in fellowship.

“all things”: refers to the things in life towards which it is possible
to have some sort of mental attitude; in other words, almost anything.

“pure”: again, (**katharos**). See ...

### Topic: Purity

At this point the cynical person may draw the wrong conclusion, namely,
that a totally pure person can touch anything, do anything, think about
anything, and remain pure as the driven snow.

But this thinking involves lifting this phrase out of the whole context
of the Bible and misinterpreting it so that it becomes both meaningless
and false.

This does not mean, “All things are pure in the judgment of the pure.” A
pure-minded man will not usually put evil constructions or
interpretations upon things, but for him to say that something is pure
because he judges it to be so, or because he cannot be defiled, is
false. The context indicates that Paul is referring to matters of
Judaistic practice, ceremonial purifications, among other things, that
have been misconstrued by the false teachers.

READ Luke 11:37-44 Christ's warning of the Pharisees.

READ Acts 10:9-21, 34, 35 Peter's vision on the housetop.

Christ exalts purity to the realm of the spirit, which automatically
does away with ceremonial purity. A pure mind cannot be contaminated by
physical contact; and the purest minds will have no relish in seeking
defilement.

READ 1 Tim. 1:4-7

This is love out of a pure heart, the fruit of the Holy Spirit. This is
not a ritual love; nor is it a labored love or a love gained by striving
for it. “Good conscience” means “cleansed; in fellowship”.

1 Tim. 5:22 :...keep thyself pure...” Refers to physical morality and to
mental attitude purity, the most important and the most difficult.

READ James 1:25-27

How does one keep himself unspotted from the world? By staying out of
bars? By giving up booze and drugs? By turning over twenty new leaves
and cleaning up one's act? Answer: the sin problems in life are attacked
in the area of the mind.

Yes, we are to flee lusts. 2 Tim. 2:22 “Flee also youthful lusts: but
follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the
Lord out of a pure heart.”

How often just the first part of the above verse is quoted, so that the
believer never learns how to have victory over areas of weakness! Lust
is desire; and desire is a mental attitude. So to “flee lusts” is to nip
the sin problem in the bud, while it is still only in the mind. Confess,
isolate, and forget the sin. Then, enjoy one more measure of victory.

READ 1 Tim. 6:9-11

These things are the product of Christian growth, of edification, of
applied knowledge of doctrine in the human spirit, of conformity to
Jesus Christ.

Recognize sin, confess it, and turn away. Prov. 1:23; 2 Chron. 7:14

READ Job. 11:13-20

READ 1 Pet. 1:18-25

Salvation is not by ceremony, but by the sacrifice of Christ. Morality
is not by ceremony, but by the purification of the soul through the Word
of God.

Eph. 5:25,26 “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
church, and gave himself for it; That he might sanctify and cleanse it
with the washing of water by the word.”

This purity is required as a qualification for the following people:

The elder Titus 1:6

Older men Titus 2:2

Older Women Titus 2:3

Young women Titus 2:4,5

Young men Titus 2:6

The word “defiled” is the perfect passive participle of (**miaino**)
which means “foul pollution”.

Mental attitude sins are the polluters of the mind. Sin, human
viewpoint, religion, false teaching -- these things destroy the capacity
to enjoy life. They destroy the important things in life such as the
capacity to love, the capacity to serve. These types of mental attitude
problems are corrupters of good things. Many believers tear down their
own happiness through mental attitude sin and never develop the capacity
for the happiness that belongs to them as Christians.

### Topic: Mental Attitude

Titus 1:16
----------

**They profess that they know God; but in works they deny Him, being
abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.**

READ Matt 7:15-23

“They profess”: (**homologeo**), “to declare publicly; to acknowledge;
to confess.”

This word is translated “confess” in 1 John 1:9, where it refers to
making a statement regarding personal sin. Acknowledgement of personal
sin is made to God in order to receive temporal cleansing.

Here, the context indicates a public declaration.

Acts 23:8 “For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.” The word simply
refers to public acknowledgement or statement.

Romans 10:9,10 “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord
Jesus, and shall believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the
dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believes unto
righteousness; a with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”

In the Romans verse, confession of sin is not the issue. There the word
refers to open declaration of faith in Christ.

1 Tim. 6:12 “Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,
whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good confession
before many witnesses.” Here the word is used in both noun and verb
forms, both meaning the making of a public testimony.

In the context of Titus 1:16, it is the false teachers who are making a
false profession -- a hypocritical show of religious fervor.

“that they know God”: “to know; to understand; to be acquainted with”

Hence, “They profess that they are acquainted with and understand God.”

This is a profession of some kind of knowledge of God. But we have seen
that they are essentially unbelieving people, either at the point of
hearing the Gospel, or at the point of doctrinal teaching .

There are many types of pseudo-religions exposed in the Bible.

READ Isa. 65:1-5 Pharisaical separation

READ Matt. 6:5-8 Religious display for public consumption

READ Matt. 7:15-23 False religion that does not honor Christ

Prov. 20:6 “Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness, but a
faithful man who can find?”

Prov. 30:12 “There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes and
yet is not washed from their filthiness.”

2 Cor. 10:12 “Wherefore, let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he
fall.”

“but in works”: (**ergon**), “a deed; an action; a work; the product or
result of activity”

“they deny him”: (**argeomai**), “to disclaim; to disown; to deny”

Isa. 29:13,14 “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw
near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have
removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by
the precept of men: Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous
work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men thall perish, and
the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.”

This is a word of negative volition. The false teachers have
deliberately disclaimed the Lord; they have disowned Him.

The word is used in Matt. 26, and other passages, to refer to Peter's
disclaiming any knowledge of Christ during His trials. Peter's denial
was by word of mouth. In our context, the denial is by actions or deeds.
That is, the public can tell by observation that the actions, or works,
of the false teachers show their testimony to be false.

The Bible, from beginning to end, insists upon a harmony of faith and
works, a correspondence between profession and practice. The false
teachers were acting as if the Creator, the Father, was some kind of
metaphysical abstraction which had no moral relationship to human life.
They behaved, and taught, as if He were neither Savior or Judge.

There are many ways by which an individual can deny Christ:

By word of mouth; saying “I am not a Christian”, such as Peter's denial.

By hypocritical life and speech:

READ Eze. 33:30-33

By a display of covetousness. Any activity which indicates that one is
covetous shows a denial of Christ, His Person and Work, and of the Plan
of God.

Covetousness is a denial of Grace provision; taking, rather than not
taking, thought for the morrow.

Covetousness is a denial of Grace promotion; seeking for status, fame,
prominence.

Covetousness is a denial of God's sovereignty, rulership; one covets his
own rights.

Covetousness is a failure to claim promises, failure to be occupied with
Christ.

Every mental attitude sin is an example of denying Christ by means of
works -- worry, jealousy, guilt complex, implacability -- with all these
the Lord is disclaimed, disowned, while we try to work out our own plans
and schemes to get what we want.

“being abominable”: “detestable; loathsome”

With these three words, “abominable”, “disobedient”, and “reprobate”,
the apostle brands the works of the false teachers. “Abominable” is used
in the Septuagint of Prov. 17:15 to describe the man who “perverts moral
distinctions.” Another form of the same root is found in Matt. 24;15 and
Rev. 17:4,5 to describe that culmination of all ungodliness and evil,
the Anti-Christ and Babylon. The word signifies that these works are
abhorrent to the purity and perfection of God.

Isa. 64:6 \*\*

Luke 16:15

“and disobedient”: (**apeitheis**), “disobedient; not submissive to
authority”

John 14:23 “...if a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father
will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.”

Note that true love for the Lord Jesus Christ comes from a love for His
Word and a desire for His rulership.

Luke 6:46 “And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
say?”

READ 2 Timothy 2:17-24

“and unto every good work”: this refers to work that is good from God's
viewpoint; divine good; gold, silver, and precious stones.

“reprobate”: (**adokimos**), “not approved; untested; unqualified; not
esteemed”, hence, “unqualified, worthless, or unfit for any good deed.”

This individual is unqualified because he lacks divine viewpoint, a
categorical knowledge of Bible truth. Two things hinder his production
for the Lord.

First, his life witness is bad, so he has no appeal as far as attracting
people to Christ is concerned.

Then, his verbal witness is useless because it comes from human
viewpoint. He does not have the gospel straight, so he cannot
evangelize. He doesn't have life doctrines straight, so he cannot help
members of the Body of Christ.

For a contrast, READ Titus 2:1-5. These qualities of mature believers
are built up over years of study, devotion to the Lord and His Word, and
positive volition to truth.

READ James 3:8-18

In spite of all this, we are amazed at Paul's faith and the magnitude of
God's grace. Remember that this exhortation has as its goal the
restoration of the false teachers. They can be transformed, by the
renewing of their minds, from being defiled in conscience and mind to
spiritual soundness and uncorrupted faith.

Titus, Chapter 2
================

Titus 2:1
---------

**But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:**

“But” : This word is a conjunction which introduces a sharp contrast
with what was written in the previous chapter.

The conclusion of chapter 1 was a description of false teachers and
heretics and the troubles they cause in a local church. By contrast,
chapters 2 and 3 contain some very direct applications regarding good
works. Sound teaching and a holy lifestyle are the antidotes for the
problems in these local churches.

Some people claim that Paul's doctrine, which emphasizes the inner man
and the work of the Holy Sprit, differs considerably from James' writing
because of James' emphasis on good works. The Epistle to Titus lays
these arguments to rest because it has very strong teaching regarding
Christian living.

“you speak”: (**laleo**), “to communicate by speaking”.

This word refers to Titus's function as a teacher of the Word. Titus is
commanded to speak as becomes the true minister of God, in contrast to
the false teachers described in the previous chapter.

Compare this verse with the last verse in the chapter.

“the things which become”:

The verb “become” is (**prepei**), meaning “it is fitting, it is proper,
it is suitable”. The doctrine which Titus is to teach is to be suitable,
proper for sound, uncorrupted messages.

“sound”: (**hugiaino**) “uncorrupted, healthy, correct, accurate”.

[See discussion on Titus 1:9 for a discussion of the use of this word.]

“doctrine”: (**didaskalia**) “teaching from an authoritative source”

2 Tim. 4:2-4 “Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;
reprove (**elegko**), rebuke (**epitimao**), exhort (**parakaleo**) with
all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will
not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to
themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their
ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.”

Again, compare with Titus 2:15.

The content of the Word of God reveals the lies and unspiritual conduct
of the false teachers. By contrast, the conduct of true believers gives
evidence of the reality in the claim to be a “new creation”, to have
been “born again”, and to have “Christ living in me.” And it is the Word
of God, “sound doctrine”, which produces a life that is pleasing to the
Lord.

A great orator can captivate people without much content; so can a
consistently entertaining person or someone with great charisma.

In a Bible class, however, the only way to keep an audience of thinking
people is to teach from the text of the Word of God.

One easy way out of all the work of scholarship is to play to the
audience - to “tickle their ears”. To tell them what they already agree
with and are enthusiastic about. That produces more pats on the back,
more recognition.

The false teacher on Crete would be tempted to pander to his audience,
for the sake of money. He might find out what political or religious
party the congregation liked, and find he could please the people by
bashing their opponents. Or he might discover what crusade the people
were on, and become a “caped crusader” himself, striking out against one
issue or another.

The Bible teacher must be the edified, mature, grace-oriented person the
Bible demands, before any teaching is done! You teach from the text; and
your life backs it up!

To apply sound doctrine, you must understand what the Bible says! You
grow in grace only from the doctrine that you understand and place your
faith in!

The teaching of (**didaskalia**) is teaching from an authoritative
source. And this command, to teach doctrine, is for the protection of
both the teacher and the congregation. It has the following benefits:

Staying with the text lifts a great burden from the teacher; God's Word
is the source of all comments and applications, not the teacher's
personal opinion.

Staying with the text reduces the temptation to “play to the crowd”, to
engage in personality dynamics.

It eliminates the “Pied Piper” effect in which the teacher becomes the
charismatic leader of the flock on some great quest.

If the teacher can stay with the text, he can resist the temptation to
preach, to scold, to bully, to pontificate, to sermonize.

He is much more likely to succeed in presenting God's point of view
rather than his own.

Sound doctrinal teaching can eliminate emotional responses to the
speaker or to his words. Sometimes what is called “motivating” is just
such an emotional response; and as such it is not lasting.

That which endures in any believer's life is that portion of the Word of
God which actually gets applied. Edification will still be there when
all emotional responses are gone.

Titus 2:2
---------

**That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in
charity, in patience.**

“That the aged men”: This is (**presbuteis**), a man mature in years, as
opposed to (**presbuteros**), meaning mature, or senior, in rank.

Philemon v. 9 “For love's sake I rather beseech you, being such a one as
Paul the aged (**presbuteis**), and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

Paul clearly does not think of himself as decrepit or elderly. He
considers himself a senior believer who can make a claim for some
respect from Philemon. This word is a reference to older men - older not
only in age but also in Christian experience. These qualities of
maturity are desirable in older people.

Note here the great practicality of Bible doctrine. Bible study is not
some arcane practice which gives its practitioners a mystic inner
quality. Rather, the Word of God transforms the inner life and outer
life, for the practical benefit of the believer and of all those who
know him.

The Word of God makes old age the crowning glory of a person's lifetime.
Old age can have promise, productivity, vitality, confidence, and a
great deal of happiness, providing that spiritual preparation has taken
place during the younger years.

The older one becomes as a believer, the more his life should improve!
God's Plan has answers to any problem that life can produce; but God's
Plan is one of preventive maintenance. A young person must prepare now
for a happy, productive old age.

Coming into old age, the mature believer has great assurance:

He is assured of his redemption

He understands salvation and spirituality by grace.

He knows how to claim promises and avoid depression and anxiety.

He understands suffering, testing, and has lived victoriously through a
lot of it.

He is ready for both suffering and happiness in his old age.

He has applied the Word of God to his experience.

### Topic: Old Age

“be sober”: from (**neiphalios**), “temperate in all areas of life.”

This is from the verb (**neipho**), meaning to be well-balanced,
self-controlled, restrained, alert.

It is not the same word which is translated “sober” in 1:8 or 2:12. That
word is (**sophron**), meaning of sound mind, mentally stable,
thoughtful, although translated sober in the KJV.

There seems to be some confusion in the translation of the KJV (at least
\*I\* am confused!). The English language is not so poor that a proper
translation could not have been made of both words, (**neipho**) and
(**sophron**), so as to show off the differences between them. We should
not have been allowed to believe that they mean the same thing.

The verb (**neipho**) had an extensive connotation in the ancient world.
In the listing of Greek inscriptions there is an indication that
(**neiphalios**) was used to describe the proper state of mind for
temple worship.

1 Thess. 5:1-8 - for an example of the extended use of (**neipho**)

2 Tim. 4:1-5. - for the connotation in (**neipho**) of watchfulness.

1 Pet. 1:13 “Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober
(**neipho**), and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought
unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;”

1 Pet. 5:8,9 “Be sober (**neipho**), be vigilant; because your adversary
the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
whom resist steadfast in the faith...”

“grave” : From (**semnos**), meaning “honorable”, “noble”, “dignified”.

Little meaning is carried into modern American English from the word
“grave”, but we still speak of the “gravity” of a situation, meaning the
seriousness of it.

The mature man is to be established in the Lord to the extent that the
Lord has given him victory over the obvious defects in his soul. He is
to have the characteristics of good character and personal integrity -
in short, nobility and dignity.

In his youth, the man's vitality, good looks, his strength, and his
youthful energy often covered up defects such as bitterness, envy,
hatred, immorality, etc. However, if these characteristics are present
in old age, they become highly visible. An elderly “babe in Christ” is a
sorry sight, and is not regarded as honorable, noble, or dignified.

Old age strips the body of its glamor in order to emphasize the beauty
of the soul. The greatest beauty can been seen in old age, it is the
beauty which is more than skin deep.

The mature believer can be a library of divine viewpoint, of stable
thinking. And a mature man's wisdom, discernment, prudence are great
assets to his community and to the local church.

“temperate”: From (**sophron**), “prudent, thoughtful, discreet.” When
used of women in Tit. 2:5, “discreet, modest.”

You begin to see what I mean about the translation. Here is
(**sophron**), translated “sober” elsewhere in Titus, but “temperate”
here and “discrete” later on. Yet \<**neiphalios**) is translated
“sober” earlier in this verse! I grant that words in translation can
take on different meanings depending on context and colloquial usage,
but this is confusing.

The word (**sophron**) does not mean temperate in the sense of
self-restraint. That word is (**egkrateis**), which we saw in Tit. 1:8.
To be temperate means to have mastery over the details of life and
self-control in all areas of life.

To be (**sophron**) means to have a mental attitude of care for one's
reputation, one's character, a consideration for appearances, along with
a connotation of mental stability. To be sure, the ideas are related,
but in application, “thoughtfulness” or “prudence” are the mental
attitudes, therefore precede self-restraint, the practical outworking of
prudence. Here again, the meaning would have been clearer in the KJV
with a more consistent interpretation.

I leave it to you to examine these verses in the NASB, the NIV, and
other versions, to decide whether the translations are more consistent
and clear, in light of this brief explanation of the definitions.

“sound in faith”: (**hugiaino**), “uncorrupted” + (**pistis**), “faith”.

(**hugiaino**) is in the present participle of the Greek verb, and used
as an adjective, “uncorrupted”, “healthy”, “whole”.

(**pistis**) is a Greek noun in the instrumental case, indicating that
“faith” is the cause (instrument) of the “soundness”.

Therefore, a more accurate reading would be, “uncorrupted because of
faith”. The older man has spiritual maturity and integrity because of
his life of faith in God and His Word.

The mature man is to be experienced in the use of faith. He has years of
experience in using faith daily, adding to his life every day layer upon
layer of applied truth.

But it is not the intensity of the faith which he holds, but the
\*object\* of his faith which is valid. Even mustard seed faith is
enough when God and His Word are the objects of the belief.

The question here is, “Can I believe the Word of God?” “Can God's
promises be trusted?” “Are Christian life principles correct; do they
work?”

“Can I really build a marriage on the Bible?” “Can I really raise my
children properly using Bible principles?” “Can I function in society,
be productive, be successful, achieve great things, by placing my
confidence in the Word of God?”

The answer here is, “Look at the mature Christians, men and women. They
are the examples of what successful Christian living can be. They look
to Jesus as the author and finisher of their faith; you can do the
same!”

The mature believer's faith is uncorrupted with worldly opinions, human
viewpoint, religious semantics, or empty false doctrines. He stands like
a rock by means of his faith in Christ and His Word.

“in charity”: (**agapei**) - impersonal love, the fruit of the Holy
Spirit.

The characteristics of Christian love, which is the fruit of spiritual
growth, are amply detailed in 1 Cor. 13.

“in patience”: (**hupomonei**), “endurance, tolerance, fortitude,
patience”

Patience (fortitude) is the ability to endure toil, suffering, severe
disappointment, without falling apart, without getting depressed,
without striking out against enemies, real or imagined.

Patience is also the ability to delay gratification, to wait for God's
timing for everything - promotion, recognition, prosperity, rights.
Children want immediate gratification of every desire, every whim.
Mature people can wait as long as necessary to receive what they need or
want, knowing that the Lord will prosper in His own time.

This is Faith-Rest in action. And this is the answer to many sin
problems in life, such as those brought on by self-indulgence.

Romans 5:1-5.

Testing is designed to build patience; character is built up in this
manner. In these verses of Romans, a Christian is put to the test and
found to be of solid character. These things are a product of patience
and lead to great confidence.

Read 2 Cor. 6:4-10.

2 Cor. 12:12 “Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in
all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.”

Read Col. 1:9-11 - concerning the source of patience.

Titus 2:3
---------

**The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becometh
holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good
things.**

Greek students like this verse because it contains a rare triple (hapax
legoumena). That means that there are three Greek words in this verse
that appear nowhere else in the Greek of the New Testament. A word that
appears only once is much harder to interpret than one which appears in
many contexts.

“The aged women”: (**presbutis**). “older woman, senior woman” Again,
this is not a reference to elderliness but to seniority.

“likewise”: “in the same manner”. A reference to the previous verse and
qualifications of older men.

“that they be in behavior”: (**katasteima**) - “a state, a condition, a
manner of life”.

This is the only place this word is used in the New Testament. However,
we get some help from Josephus, Plutarch, and a few Greek inscriptions,
and learn that in the first century, the word “behavior” referred to a
person's condition or state.

In modern American, the word “behavior” refers to conduct or manners.
But in the older English of 1611, as in the Greek, “behavior” referred
much more to a life condition, to a person's inner characteristics,
which would, in turn, lead to an outward behavior. Here the KJV is very
close to the Greek when we use the colloquial English of the early 17th
Century (see Oxford English dictionary).

“as becometh holiness”: (**hieroprepeis**), from (**hiero**), “temple” +
(**prepeis**), “suitable”, thus, “suitable for the temple”, or “suitable
to be used in worship”.

This is the second singular occurrence (hapax legoumena) in this verse.
When this word was used to describe a person, it meant “worthy of
reverence or respect”. It was used in literature outside the Bible to
describe the conduct of a priest in the Greek temple.

While not found elsewhere in the New Testament, the word is seen in
Greek literature, in Josephus; and in IV Maccabees 9:25 (Septuagint
Greek translation), in the phrase, “...the revered (**hieroprepeis**)
youth let go his life”, referring to a martyr's death.

The older woman is to have a reputation or manner of life that is worthy
of respect as a mature woman of God.

“not false accusers”:

This is the plural feminine of (**diabolos**), “treacherous informers”.

The verb form is (**diaballo**), meaning “to throw through; to throw
over; to defame; to inform against; to bring charges with hostile
intent.” (English cognate, “diabolical”)

In the N.T., when this word appears in Greek with the definite article
(and in the masculine), (**ho diabolos**), it refers to Satan, the
Devil, “the accuser” of the brethren.

The godly woman is to have victory over sins of the tongue,
particularly, in this case, the sin of bearing false witness, that is,
of being a false accuser.

1 Tim. 3:11 “Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
faithful in all things.

The deacons themselves are to be “grave, not doubletougued, not given to
much wine...”

### Topic: Sins of the Tongue

“not given to much wine”:

This reads the same in English as Tit. 1:7, but the Greek is different.
In 1:7, the word is (**paroinos**), which means “drunk with wine”, or
“quarrelsome when in his cups”. There is a discussion in the notes for
1:7 regarding the use of alcohol by Christians.

Here the phrase is (**oinw pollw dedulomenas**), and it's interesting to
try to learn the meanings of the Greek words here. That word
(**dedulomenas**) is form of the verb (**douloo)**. You may remember the
noun form (**doulos**), “servant” or “slave”. In Titus 1:1, Paul calls
himself a (**doulos**) of God.

This phrase means “to be in bondage or slavery to wine” or “to be under
the restraint of wine”.

The KJV simply does not carry this meaning well at all. The phrase “not
given to much wine” is much weaker than the Greek original.

To be effective in her personal witness for the Lord, and as an adviser
and teacher of younger women, the mature godly woman must not be in
bondage to addictions of the flesh, in particular in this passage, to
alcohol.

Drunkenness was a big problem on Crete during this period; that's why
it's mentioned so prominently in this letter.

“teachers of good things”: (**kalodidaskalos**), “one who teaches good”.

This is the third (hapax legoumena) - [by now you know what I mean!]

The importance of the teaching ministry of the older woman is seen in
the next two verses. There are many young women who need the example and
godly wisdom of the senior women in the church. The older woman's advice
and teaching must be backed up with a consistent, holy lifestyle,
accompanied by the ability to teach doctrine that is consistent with the
production of divine good.

Titus 2:4
---------

**That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
husbands, to love their children,**

This verse begins with a purpose clause (beginning with “that”) that
points to the reason for the conditions set up in verse 3.

One of the purposes for having mature, knowledgeable older women is for
the teaching of younger women. These types of mature women are scarce.

Someone has to teach the younger woman how to love her husband and her
children. You can't get what you need from “Dear Abby”. That's like
leading a lamb to the slaughter!

“that they may teach the young women to be sober”:

Now, the words “they may teach...to be sober” are one word in the Greek,
the verb (**sophronidzo**) -- “to teach to be mentally stable; to bring
someone to his senses”. We have seen the adjective form (**sophron**) in
previous verses, so maybe even the Greek is becoming a little more
familiar to you.

Again, the translation “to teach to be sober” does not carry the weight
of the much more comprehensive Greek meaning.

This verb connotes sanity of mind and stability of thinking. There are
many enemies of sanity and mental stability. A young married woman has
great pressures of married life and exhausting work in child rearing.
There is great opportunity for depression and bitterness to creep in.
The older woman's counsel enables the young woman to be occupied with
Christ, to see life “with eternity's values in view”, to make decisions
from the wisdom of God's viewpoint.

### Topic: Mental Attitude

The mature woman will have sanity, clarity of thought, wisdom,
edification in the soul. She will be the picture of Grace. And she will
be able to communicate these things to young women. She is a jewel among
women and has an enormous task in her function as a teacher.

“to love their husbands”: (**philandros**), --\> “to be husband-loving”

This is the only use of this Greek Word in the NT, but this word was
common in the epitaphs of wives written on tombs.

A tomb inscription of the time of the Emperor Hadrian (3rd Cent.) read,
“Julius Bassus to Otacilia Polla, his sweetest wife. Loving her husband
(**philandros**) and loving her children (**philoteknos**), she lived
with him unblameably for 30 years.”

“to love their children”: (**philoteknos**) “loving one's children”,
having due parental concern.

You wonder why a young woman has to be taught to love her own children.
But for Christians, due parental concern goes far beyond natural
maternal love (which does not have to be taught). The idea in this verse
takes into consideration all of the child's life and concerns itself
with everything that is associated with bringing him up in the nuture
and admonition of the Lord.

This includes child training, education, teaching manners and decorum,
respect for privacy and property, respect for authority, especially the
authority of God, dependence on God, love for the Lord Jesus Christ and
the Word of God.

Titus 2:5
---------

**To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own
husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.**

“to be discreet”: (**sophron**) - “having a sound mind, sensible,
discreet”

Here, (**sophron**) is translated “discreet”, rather than “sober” or
“temperate”. But it carries the same idea of sensibility and stability
of thinking, one results of which would be discretion.

By the way, the NIV does a good service by consistently rendering
(**sophron**) as “sensible”. When you read the NIV with this in mind,
you become aware of the connotation of mental stability and sensibility
behind the thinking and actions of the people described.

“chaste”: (**hagnos**) - “pure, chaste, modest, innocent, blameless”.

Both men and women have to be taught about sin, about true love and
marriage, about proper behavior between sexes, so that they can avoid
sin and experience God's blessings in life to the maximum.

READ Ruth 3:1-11

“keepers at home”: (**oikourgos**) - “one who is occupied with domestic
affairs”.

Proverbs 31 is the best description of the godly wife in her daily life.

I don't even need to comment. The Scripture always provides better
examples and illustrations of doctrine, anyway, and that's always
preferable to an teacher's comments.

“good”: (**agathos**) - “good, profitable, generous, upright”.

This young woman will be a channel of blessing, to her husband and
family and to others. She will grow spiritually beyond the selfishness
of childhood. She will be a conduit of the Grace of God. Out of her
innermost being will flow rivers of living water.

“obedient to their own husbands”: “to be subject to their own husbands”

Notice the order in which counsel is to be given. First, LOVE. Then,
MENTAL STABILITY, then PURITY, then HOMEMAKER, finally, subjection to
husbands.

It takes spiritual preparation to be willingly submissive to authority,
of whatever type. When a Christian has actually grown somewhat in
Christ, submission is nowhere near so large an issue.

Many novice Christian young women are incensed by the idea of any type
of submission. Maybe they responded poorly to their parents' authority.
They certainly want their freedom now, and they don't want some man,
even a husband, lording it over them.

But the “sensible” Christian woman knows there is much more at stake,
that a much larger plan is involved.

Christian marriage is portrayed in Ephesians 5 as a picture of the
relationship of Jesus Christ to His church. The husband is commanded to
love his wife “as Christ loves the church”. The wife is commanded to
submit to her husband as the church does to the Lord.

God intends for Christian marriage to be an object lesson of this
spiritual relationship to an unbelieving and careless world. It is a
picture that must not be marred! If either the husband or the wife fail
to fulfill the commands regarding their responsibilities in marriage,
they become stumbling blocks of the worst kind, because they cloud the
Gospel picture.

How does Satan “blind the minds of them who believe not, lest the light
of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine unto them”? Well, one way
is by tempting Christians to have non-Biblical marriages. And this is
strikingly brought out in the next phrase...

“that the Word of God be not blasphemed”: this is (**blaspheimeo**), “to
slander; to dishonor”

This is the naked blade of the Word of God, the “two-edged sword”. The
issue is very clear. Marriage is a picture of the Gospel. Failure to
obey the commands regarding marriage brings slander on the Word of God.
If you bring slander on the Word of God, you are in for big trouble!
Jesus said that those who hindered little children from coming to Him
would have been better off if they had been drowned at birth.

“God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
repentance.” There is every indication in the Bible that the quickest
way to come under severe divine chastisement is to hinder some
unbeliever from receiving Christ!

All of the commands and principles of the Bible regarding marriage,
sexual promiscuity, homosexuality, divorce, are laid out by God for one
main reason, to convince the world to accept Christ as Savior. All other
reasons for chastity, integrity, fidelity, and love in marriage, while
important, are secondary to this.

Titus 2:6
---------

**Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.**

“Young men”: from (**neoteros**), “the young”. “likewise”: “in the same
manner; in the same way; likewise”

“exhort”: (**parakaleo**), “to exhort; to urge”

“to be sober-minded”: from (**sophroneo**), “to be in one's right mind;
to think sensibly; to be serious. Yet another use of this (now familiar)
word. Briefly, then, “all of the above” can be applied to young men. So,
without further ado ...

Titus 2:7
---------

**In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works; in doctrine
showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,**

“In all things”: (**peri panta**), “concerning all things; in every way;
by all means”

“showing thyself”: the verb is, “to exhibit; to present; to hold out
something”.

In this case, Titus is to exhibit himself as a model or example of good
works.

“a pattern”: (**tupos**), “a model; a standard; an example; a pattern”

Other scriptures where (**tupos**) is used:

Rom. 5:14 “Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is
the figure (**tupos**) of him that was to come.”

Rom. 6:17 “But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye
have obeyed from the heart that form (**tupos**) of doctrine which was
delivered you.”

1 Cor. 10:6 “Now these things were our examples (**tupos**), to the
intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.”

READ Phil 3:17-21

READ 1 Thess. 1:1-10; The testimony of the Thessalonian believers!

1 Tim. 4:12 “Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example
(**tupos**) of the believers, in word, in conversation, in love, in
spirit, in faith, in purity.”

1 Pet. 5:1-3; The example of elders.

“of good works”:

Eph. 2:10; We are “created in Christ Jesus for the purpose of good
works.”

2 Thess. 3:1-15; This is the Apostle Paul's personal testimony as to how
he was an example to other believers in good works.

“in doctrine”: (**didaskalia**), “teaching; learning; doctrine”.

Therefore, principles of the Word of God. The Word of God is “profitable
for doctrine ”

“showing uncorruptness”: (**aphthoria**), “purity; incorruption”.

Related to: (**aphthartos**), “uncorrupted, incorruptible” and
(**aphtharsia**), “incorruption, immortality”

Titus' teaching was to be from a background of uncorrupted learning,
which is only possible when it is the Word of God being taught.

1 Pet. 1:23 “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides forever.”

Rom. 1:23 “And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image
made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and
creeping things.”

1 Cor. 9:25 “Men striving for the masteyr but receiving a corruptible
crown.”

1 Cor. 15:42, 50-54; There is no mixing of corruption with incorruption
(**aphtharsia**).

2 Tim. 1:10 “But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior
Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and
immortality (**aphtharsia**) to light through the gospel:”

“gravity”: (**semnoteis**), “dignity, seriousness”.

1 Tim. 2:2 “For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may
lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty
(**semnoteis**).”

1 Tim. 3:4

See discussion of “grave” the notes on Titus 2:2

“sincerity”

This word did not show up in my version of the Greek New Testament. So
we are led to wonder why it was included in the English of the KJV.

Titus 2:8
---------

**Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you**

“Sound speech”: (**logos hagios**), “uncorrupted speech”.

To be able to have “sound speech”, you have to start with “sound
doctrine”.

“that cannot be condemned”: from (**akatagnostos**), “not able to be
condemned; irreprehensible”.

This is the only occasion for the use of this word in the negative, but
there are several references which use the positive “reprehensible”
(katagnwsto\~):

Gal. 2:11 “But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
face, because he was to be blamed (**katagnostos**).”

1 John 3:19-21 “And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall
assure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us
(**katagnostos**), God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all
things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
toward God.”

“that he that is of the contrary part”: (**ho ex enantias**), “he who is
opposed; an adverse party; a hostile individual”

Interesting scriptures where the same Greek word is used [words in
brackets]:

Matt. 14:24 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with
waves: for the wind was [contrary].

See also Acts 27:4, when Paul was aboard ship in a storm.

Mark 15:39 And when the centurion, which stood [over against] him, saw
that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was
the Son of God.

“Contrary” in the physical sense.

Acts 28:17 “And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said
unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing [against]
the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from
Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.”

1 Thess. 2:14,15

“may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.”: “ashamed” is the
verb (**entrepo**) in the aorist subjunctive passive, “to turn a person
back on himself; to be put to shame; to be embarrassed.”

1 Cor. 4:14 “I write not these things to shame you (**entrepo**), but as
my beloved sons I warn you.”

2 Thess 3:14 “And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note
that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed
(**entrepo**).”

A “contrary” person may say evil things of you, but if they are not
true, he is the only one who can be embarrased.

This does not mean that a contrary person will not badmouth you. It
means that the maligning will not be true, there will be no substance to
his stories.

To state the application in a different way, “Don't allow lapses in your
personal behavior or in your teaching provide ammunition to your
detractors.”

1 Peter 2:11-16

Note that three methods have become apparent by which the doctrinally
disorderly person can be reached:

​1. By the teaching of sound doctrine which zeros in on the problem with
divine viewpoint.

​2. By the consistent testimony of Christian believers.

​3. By the separation of believers from him or from his activities.

Titus 2:9
---------

**Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please
them well in all things; not answering again;**

### Topic: Servants and Slaves in Palestine

“Exhort” - no corresponding Greek word in this verse. The word “exhort”
is italicized in the KJV, indicating that it has been added by the
translators, probably because they wanted to indicate the continuation
of the idea of exhortation begun in verse 6.

“servants”: (**doulos**), “slave; servant”.

The word can be used to refer to servants (employees) or slaves.

Christian slaves often worked for unbelievers in the Roman Empire;
probably even on Crete. While slavery was a great evil; Paul did not
become sidetracked by condemning the practice of slavery. Paul declares
the greater issues of doctrine, of how God's plan provides for believers
who are categorized as slaves or laborers.

This goes along well with Paul's statement “for I have learned, in
whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.” (Phil. 4:11)

Even under conditions of slavery believers can have inner happiness and
other blessings compatible with their lives during the early church
times. Whether slave or free, every believer functions under all of the
techniques of the Christian Way of Life.

“to be obedient in all things”: (**hupotasso**), “to be subject to; to
obey”.

This word comes from a background of military usage and refers to
accepting orders under conditions of discipline and strict organization.

This is a command for all Christians. Every believer is in full time
Christian service. Regardless of what vocation a person follows, he or
she is working under orders from above. The concept of doing one's job
“as unto the Lord” is derived from this concept.

This means that orders are accepted and obeyed without regard for the
personality or character of the one giving the orders. If the Christian
doesn't like what he's being told, he keeps a poker face and says “Yes,
sir!”.

There is no excuse for a Christian of offer less that 110% of his effort
to the people who he works for. Jobs are provided by the Grace of God;
the U.S.A. with its capitalistic system is a product of grace.

Prov 25:13 “As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
messenger to them that send him: for he refreshes the soul of his
masters.”

Prov 27:18 “Whoso keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
that waits on his master shall be honored.”

Matt 24:44,45 “Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye
think not the Son of Man comes. Who then is a faithful and wise servant,
whom his lord has made ruler over his household, to give them meat in
due season.”

Eph 6:5,6 “Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according
to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as
unto Christ; Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of
Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;”

1 Tim 6:1,2 “Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own
masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be
not blasphemed. And they that have believing masters, let them not
despise them ...”

### Topic: Christian in the Workplace

### Topic: Servants of God

“unto their own masters”: (**despoteis**) - “an owner or master of
slaves; a despot”.

A despot was an actual slave owner in ancient times; in modern times, a
despot is a ruler whose subjects are in virtual slavery under his
government.

Acts 4:24 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God
with one accord, and said, LORD, thou art God, which hast made heaven,
and earth,and the sea, and all that in them is:

2 Tim 2:20, 21 “But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold
and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and
some to dishonor. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall
be a vessel unto honor, sancitified, and meet for the MASTER' s use,
prepared unto every good work.”

See also 1 Pet 2:18-24

“to please them well”: Actually, this is the adjective form,
(**euarestos**), rather than a verb. Therefore, “to be well-pleasing; to
be acceptable”.

Other uses of (**euarestos**):

Rom 12:1-3; Rom 14:16-18; 2 Cor 5:6-9; Eph. 5:6-10; Phil 4:16-19; Col.
3:20; Heb. 11:5,6; Heb. 13:15-21

“not answering again”: (**antilego**) - “contradicting; gainsaying”

See Titus 1:9 for discussion of (**antilego**) under the concept of
“gainsayers”, those who oppose the Word of God.

Here, the servant is exhorted not to be the type of subordinate who is
constantly talking back to his master, constantly contradicting in an
insubordinate manner.

Titus 2:10
----------

**Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the
doctrine of God our Savior in all things.**

“Not purloining”: (**nosphidzo**), “to put away; to remove; to abstract;
to steal; to appropriate for oneself”.

This word comes from a form meaning “furtively; secretly”. This is yet
another Greek word which appears only once in the N.T.

The following notes are from Moulton & Milligan, “The Vocabulary of the
Greek New Testament”:

In the Flinders Petrie Papyri (3rd Cent. AD) - an official swears an
oath, “I will not peculate (steal) (**nosphidzo**), and I will report
anyone who does peculate.”

In the catalog of the Greek Papyri in the John Rylands Library in
Manchester, England, someone writes of a woman, “oppressed by the
consciousness of what she had appropriated for herself (**nosphidzo**)
both of the furniture and stored articles.

Dishonesty was a way of life for the Cretans, just as it is for many
people today. Whenever discipline or personal integrity is even slightly
relaxed, honesty and productivity slip a lot. Most employees are in a
position to steal something: pencils, computer time, petty cash, working
time.

The honest Christian laborer stands out in a society like this. Honesty
and good character are two of the most important aspects of the
Christian's testimony. In any witnessing situation, these traits are
necessary before any verbal testimony can be successful. Lev 19:35,36;
Deut 25:13-16

Prov 11:1 “A false balance is abomination to the Lord: but a just weight
is his delight.”

See also Prov. 16:11; 20:10; Micah 6:9-14.

Rom 12:17 “Recompense no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the
sight of all men.”

2 Cor 8:20-24

Eph 4:28 “Let him that stole, steal no more; rather let him labor,
working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give
to him that needeth.”

1 Thess 4:11,12 “That ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; that ye may walk
honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of
nothing.”

“but showing”: (**endeiknumai**), “to display; to manifest; to give
outward proof; to display openly toward another.”

This is a Christian testimony word, a command to present a witness to
the world; the principle of “salt and light”.

Rom. 2:14,15; Rom. 3:21-26; 2 Cor. 8:24

Eph. 2:7 “That in the ages to come he might show (**endeiknumai**) the
exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ
Jesus.”

The Lord intends for us to be a testimony to His grace, both now in in
eternity.

2 Thess. 1:5; 2 Tim. 4:14; Heb. 6:10,11

“all good fidelity”: (**pistis**), “faith”

Gen. 39:1-6; 2 Kings 12:1-15; Neh. 13:10-13; Dan. 6:4; 1 Cor. 4:1,2

“that they may adorn”: (**kosmeo**), “to arrange; to set in order; to
decorate; to embellish; to prepare; to trim; to put in readiness; to
honor; to dignify”

Matt. 23:29 “Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you
build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish (**kosmeo**) the sepulchres
of the righteous...”

Matt 25:7 “Then all those virgins arose and trimmed (**kosmeo**) their
lamps.”

Luke 21:5 “And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned
(**kosmeo**) with goodly stones and gifts,”

1 Tim 2:9 “...women adorn (**kosmeo**) themselves in modest apparel...”
The adorning of the heart is to be given priority.

Rev. 21:2,19 “And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down
from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And
the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished (**kosmeo**) with
all manner of precious stones.”

One of the main goals of God's plan is that every Christian “adorn” or
“decorate” the doctrine of the Lord.

“the doctrine”: (**didaskalia**), “the teaching; the doctrine”.

“of God our Savior in all things”

Titus 2:11
----------

**For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,**

“For the grace of God”

It is because of what God has done in Grace that the Cretan believers
were Christians in the first place; and that the holy life which has
been described in 2:1-10 is possible.

It is as if God were saying, “Do this, because you can do it; my Grace
was given for this purpose!”

### Topic: Grace

“hath appeared”: (**epiphainoo**), “to show forth; to display; to shine
upon” [Eng: epiphany]

The whole favor of God is manifested in the “Epiphany”, the
“Manifestation” of Christ. Verse 3:4 uses other words to describe the
grace of God, “... the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared”.

The Grace of God, and the appearance of Christ, distinguish Christianity
from all religion. This is a historical reality which changes men's
lives.

Luke 1:78,79 “Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
from on high hath visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. And
the child grew...”

Acts 11:22-24; Col. l:6; I Pet. 5:12; Acts 13:43; Rom 1:5; Eph 3:2,7

“that brings salvation to all men”

Salvation is made available to all men.

Salvation is the most comprehensive spiritual concept in Christianity.
The mighty God performed a transaction that encompasses time and
eternity, and makes it possible for any person to take part in it,
because of the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ on the Cross.

The topical study, Salvation Doctrines, provides a detailed look at all
of the parts of what might be called the “salvation package”, those
things which God does for a believer at the moment he accepts Christ as
Savior.

### Topic: Salvation Doctrines

Titus 2:12
----------

**Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;**

“teaching us that”: (**paideuo**), “to rear or train (as a child), to
educate, to instruct”.

Examples of the use of (**paideuo**):

(**paideuo**) = “to train”

Acts 7:22 “And Moses was learned (**paideuo**) in all the wisdom of the
Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.”

Acts 22:3 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in
Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught
(**paideuo**) according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers,
and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.”

2 Tim. 2:25,26 “In meekness instructing (**paideuo**) those that oppose
themselves; if God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
truth; And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the
devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.”

(**paideuo**) = “to correct; to discipline; to chasten”

1 Cor. 11:32 “But when we are judged, we are chastened (**paideuo**) by
the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world”

See also 2 Cor. 6:9

1 Tim. 1:20 “Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered
unto Satan, that they may learn (**paideuo**) not to blaspheme.”

Here, (**paideuo**) is translated “may learn” (in the passive voice),
but it is clear that not just the impartation of knowledge but severe
discipline is intended.

Another use of (**paideuo**) is seen in Luke 23:16 and 22, in which
Pilate, since he had declared the Lord “not guilty” of the charge
brought against Him, and hence could not punish him, offered as a
concession to the Jews to “chastise (**paideuo**) him and let him go.”

The noun form is (**paideuteis**), “educator, instructor, chastiser”.

Rom. 2:20 “An instructor (**paideuteis**) of the foolish, a teacher
(**didaskalos** !) of babes, which have the form of knowledge and of the
truth in the law.”

Note the two types of teachers mentioned here - the connotation of
strict teaching, or chastisement, is used with the “foolish” but not
used with respect to “babes.”

Heb. 12:9 “Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline
(**paideuo**) us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be
subject to the Father of spirits, and live?

Another noun in (**paideia**), “discipline, instruction”

Eph. 6:4, “...but bring them up in the nurture and admonition
(**paideuo**) of the Lord.”

2 Tim. 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
(**paideuo**) in righteousness.”

There are also the words (**paideusis**), “training; education; a
school”, and paideuma (**paideuma**), “one who is trained; a pupil”

“denying ungodliness”: (**arneomai**), “to deny; disown; renounce.” plus
(**asebeian**), “impiety; unholiness”

Compare “godliness” (**eusebeia**) in 1:1 with “ungodliness” here.

Rom. 1:18 “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness (**asebeian**) and unrighteousness of men, who hold the
truth in unrighteousness.”

Good reason for Christians not to participate in ungodliness!

2 Tim. 2:16 “But shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase
unto more ungodliness (**asebeian**).”

One of the ways to avoid falling into ungodliness as a lifestyle. This
verb (“denying) emphasizes the firm decision of the believer who stoutly
refuses to participate in the world system.

“and worldly lusts”: **(tas kosmikas epithumias**), “an irregular or
violent desire for the things belonging to the universe”, “lust
accommodated to the present state of things of the world”.

Hence, lust patterns of the soul, such as a desire for approval and
recognition, materialism, sex, power, etc. We are commanded to “deny”
these things.

“we should live”: aorist active subjunctive of (**zao)**, “we should
live”

These verses are about what it really means to be grace oriented. Living
by grace depends on whether the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit
and is constantly growing in Christ. In Greek grammar, the subjunctive
mood of the verb here indicates potential, godly living depends on the
volition of the believer. We have to choose to be godly, to avoid
worldly lusts. The words “soberly; righteously; godly” are terms
relating to the outward grace life. These are the results of grace
orientation, living by grace, occupation with the Lord Jesus Christ.

“soberly”: (**sophronos**), “sensible; mentally stable”.

This word indicates that the Word of God is so well assimilated in the
soul that the Christian's standards of life are God's standards.

“righteously”: (**dikaios**), “righteousness”.

In practical Christianity, this refers to the production of gold,
silver, precious stones =\> the output of divine good through the
exercise of the Word of God in the life.

“godly”: (**eusebos**), an adverb from eusebeia (**eusebeia**),
“godliness”

2 Tim. 3:12 “Yea, and all that will live godly...”

2 Pet. 2:9 “The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of testing...”

References: 1 Tim. 2:1-3; 3:15,16; 4:7,8; 6:36 Titus 1:1; 2 Pet. 1:3-7.

### Topic: Godliness

“in this present world”: “in this now age”. Reference to the age in
which we now live, the age prior to the return of Christ.

Titus 2:13
----------

**Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
God and our Savior Jesus Christ;**

“Looking for”: (**prosdecomai**). This verb means “to receive” or “to
expect to receive”.

This word was used for receiving a gift, or receiving a guest into a
household. In every case, that which is received is a benefit or
pleasure. Therefore, this word has come to mean “to wait for something
with keen anticipation.”

Every believer looks forward to a time when he will have perfect
environment, a perfect body, perfect happiness. A Christian's present
condition may be one of frustration, unhappiness in details of life,
suffering; yet the Lord will returne and there is heaven over the
horizon.

“blessed”: (**makarias**), “happiness”.

This is the New Testament word for Joy, the happiness which is God
provides, the fruit of the Holy Spirit, a happiness which does not
depend on circumstances, people, or things.

Happiness is freedom from mental attitude sins, freedom from misery,
freedom from neurosis and psychosis, mastery of details of life, and the
accompaniment to many other benefits of the Christian life.

“hope”: (**elpis**), “confident expectation”.

The Christian's assurance is based on known facts concerning the future.
Heb. 11:1; Titus 1:2.

### Topic: Hope

“and the glorious appearance”: The KJV renders “glory” as an adjective,
but in the Greek it is a noun. The word “glory” is (**doksa**), used
throughout the NT to refer to the perfect character of God, or Christ,
in this case.

The word “appearance” is (**epifaneia**) (English: epiphany), and refers
to the second coming of Christ at the end of this present age.

The translation, then, is “the appearance of the glory” [which the NASB
gives], which is the substance of our keen anticipation.

“of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ”: a total description of
the joining of deity and humanity in Christ. The words “God” and
“Christ” refer to the deity of Christ. The words “Savior” and “Jesus”
refer to his humanity.

So there is a time coming when all believers will be totally happy in
every respect, when Jesus Christ will appear.

### Topic: The Rapture

Titus 2:14
----------

**Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.**

“Who gave himself for us”

The relative pronoun “who” refers to the Lord Jesus Christ. The verb
“gave” (didomi) refers to a point in time when Christ provided
salvation, the time of His death on the Cross.

The active voice means that Christ took this action upon Himself. That
is, God the Father did not sacrifice the Son without Christ's being
willing to go through with it. In the Garden of Gethsemane Christ said,
“Not my will, but thine be done.”

“for us”

This is a phrase indicating that Christ was our substitute on the Cross.
He paid our ransom price, to buy us out of the slave market of sin.

“that he might redeem us”, or “For the purpose of” redeeming us.

Redeem is (**lutroo**), which means “to release for ransom; to deliver
or set free for ransom”.

### Topic: Redemption

“from all iniquity”

Iniquity is lawlessness. The source of lawlessness is the Sin Nature
which we received as a result of spiritual death, at the time the fall
of the human race with Adam. We practice lawlessness when we commit
personal sin.

But we have been redeemed from that bondage. “Shall we sin the more than
grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we that are dead to sin abide
any longer therein.”

“and purify unto himself” (**katharadzo**). “to purify; to cleanse” An
English cognate is “catharsis”.

Refers to ceremonial or religious or moral purification. It was also
used in Greek to refer to healing from a disease which was considered
hopeless, such as leprosy (Mt. 8:2,3; 10:8).

In this passage the word refers to cleansing at the point of salvation
and at times during the believer's lifetime when he confesses his sins
and is “cleansed from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).

### Topic: Purity

READ Heb. 9:11-23; 1 John 1:6-10.

The subjunctive mood indicates that purification is potential and
conditional upon the faith of the individual in the work of Christ on
the cross.

READ James 4:4-8. Positional purification is to be followed by temporal,
or experiential, purification.

It is very important to compare the very similar idea of cleansing in
Ephesians 5:25-27.

“Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ loved the church, and gave
himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious
church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it
should be holy and without blemish”

Jesus Christ died for us to remove us from the sphere of “all iniquity”,
in order to put us through a cleansing process. This verse in Titus says
that He did it if “for himself”. The Ephesians passage shows that He
intends to present a spotless, pure church to Himself.

And the mechanics of the cleansing process are indicated in Ephesians -
“by the washing of water by the word...” Notice also that in Titus 3:5,
regeneration is said to be a washing process.

The words “washing”, “cleansing”, “purifying” indicate some of the most
important teaching of the Christian way of life, in terms of a
Christian's actual walk with the Lord.

And there is a direct relationship between New Testament teaching about
purification and the Old Testament Jewish rituals of sacrifice,
cleansing, and purification that took place on a daily basis in the
tabernacle and the temple. It is imperative that a Christian understand
these principles from the Word of God, and be able to correlate the Old
and New Testament teachings so that they have a single message.

“a peculiar people”

The word “peculiar” means “something that belongs to an individual as
distinct from others”, or “distinguished in nature, character,
attributes from others”. This is the meaning chosen by the KJV
translators here.

A sect in England from 1838 into the early 20th Cent. was called The
Peculiar People, or Plumstead's Peculiars. The assembled mostly in
London. They had no preachers, no creeds, no ordinances, no church
organization. The rejected medical aid or medicine, relying entirely on
prayer for healing.

An evangelical group at Oxford University in about 1839 was derisively
called “The Peculiars”, although they were not of that sect.

“zealous of good works.” (**zeiloteis**), “fanatical” for “honorable
works”

i.e., gold, silver, precious stones - divine good; the works which God
has “before ordained that we should walk in them.” Ephesians 2:8-10
states that good works are expected as a result of the salvation
received by grace.

Titus 2:15
----------

**These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no
man despise thee.**

This verse is a continuation from verse 1, verses 2 to 14 having been
parenthetical.

“These things” refers to the sound doctrine which Titus was commanded to
speak. And the rest of chapter 2 provides illustrations of the type of
teaching that is to be done.

“speak” the present active imperative of (**laleo**).

This is a continuous action imperative of the Greek verb. Titus's orders
are to keep on communicating Bible truth in order to straighten out the
problems on Crete. The content of his teaching is to be “these things”.

In fact, these three verbs are all imperatives, commands to speak,
exhort, rebuke.

“exhort”, (**parakaleo**) “to comfort; to admonish”

Here is one of the key words of the Christian experience. The Holy
Spirit is called the Paraclete, because He comforts, and He admonishes
and convicts of sin.

Christians are commanded to “exhort” one another. Sometimes that calls
for a comforting ministry, and sometimes it calls for straight talk.

In this verse, it is the meaning “admonish” that is meant. The Greek
scholars say that this is true whenever the word (**parakaleo**) is
followed by (**elegko**) “rebuke”, as it is here.

“rebuke”, (**elegko**), “to rebuke”

These are three approaches to making one point of doctrine.

There are several types of Christian. Some learn easily through teaching
and respond with faith as each principle is laid down.

Other require bracing, the pointed example, the warning, the
admonishment.

A few require serious rebuke, amounting to a verbal slap to wake them
up.

The sense of this verse is that, if speaking doesn't get the idea across
to the listeners, then move up to admonishment. And remembering that
some of the people Titus is dealing with are “gainsayers”, he may have
to increase the intensity to the point of offering “rebuke”.

Now this third method is not necessarily desirable, and it is the slow,
painful method of learning. But it is necessary in some cases,
especially with some believers who are already indoctrinated in some
system of legalism or emotionalism.

But we see in Titus 3:10,11 that the “heretic”, who does not respond to
any teaching, must be “rejected”, so rebuke is not too strong a
treatment if the alternative is to be made to leave the congregation.

Remember that it is Titus who is being commanded to “speak, exhort,
rebuke”.

It takes a very discerning and advanced believer to know how to admonish
or rebuke properly. It takes experience and training, or other believers
can be blown out of the water by misguided “admonishment”. When a novice
believer tries to “rebuke” someone, it is often no more than
self-righteous criticism.

“with all authority”

Titus's authority comes from God, so he can teach with dogmatic
authority.

### Topic: Authority

“let no man despise thee.”

The verb here is (**periphroneo**), literally “to think around”.
Combined with the negative the meaning becomes “disregard”, or “don't
let anyone disregard or reject what you are teaching with all authority.

This refers to anyone in the congregation. It would seem that the
teacher would find it impossible to obey this command, because there is
no way he can control the volition of all the believers in his church.
While the objective of the communication is to allow the Word to
motivate the volition of the Christians, the pastor does not have a key
to turn a person's volition on or off.

Anyone who teaches the Word of God must be as well prepared as possible
and be able to teach authoritatively. Authority, or regard, or respect,
is not a mantle one can put on. It is not a title that can be assumed.

People will listen and respond to the Word of God accurately and
authoritatively taught, because it \*is\* the Word of God, not the ideas
of men.

That is why the emphasis in Titus is on “sound doctrine”, “preaching”,
so that the teacher can “exhort and convince the gainsayers”. It is the
Word of God that is convincing, not the opinions, ideas, or sermonizing
of someone who just wants to hold an audience.

Titus, Chapter 3
================

Titus 3:1
---------

**Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, and to
obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work**

“Put them in mind”, (**hupomimneisko**) - “to remind someone about
something”.

Here, the Cretans are to be reminded - that is, taught - that their
obligation as believers is to be submissive to the authorities in their
communities.

The Cretans were implacable and rebellious by nature and culture. They
were a law unto themselves. Many Greek and Roman generals found them
ungovernable as soldiers except by offers of reward and booty in combat.

The Cretan society was not a society of grace, mercy, and peace - when
there were no foreign wars to absorb their energies, there were constant
skirmishes between the cities and fightin among the clans.

Here, the teacher is to stand before the people and “remind them”.

“to be subject”, (**hupotasso**) - “to be subordinate; to be obedient;
to submit to authority”

This word had an extensive military usage in the sense of obedience to
regimented command..

“to principalities”, (**arkei**) - “rulers; kings; commanding generals”.

In Greece, this word referred to principal leaders of the Greek
city-states, like Athens or Sparta. On Crete, the cities were rule by
the (kosmoi), the committees.

“and powers”, (**exousias**) - “rulers; people of power”

But this word was used more often of subordinate officials, hence, city
officials, police officers, judges, etc.

“and to obey magistrates”, (**peitharkeo**) - “to obey rulers”

The verb here is translated into the English verb and noun “to obey
magistrates”. In Acts 5:28,29, only a verb is used in English because
the one to be obeyed is God.

“Did we not straitly command you that you should not teach in this name?
And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine ... Them Peter
and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey
(**peitharkeo**) God rather than men.”

This speaks of respect for the authority of God, followed by obedience
to his commands.

“to be ready to every good work”

“Ready” is (**etoimos**), “prepared; in readiness”. The preparation of a
Christian to produce bona fide good works is outlined in chapters 1 and
2. The result of being occupied with Christ, growing in Christ, and
becoming a mature believer is “good works”.

The production of divine good in the Christian life (gold, silver, and
precious stone\~) stems in part from the proper response to authority.
Therefore, respect for authority is an essential part of a believer's
personal witness - it has the potential to save individuals and nations.

Titus 3:2
---------

**To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all
meekness unto all men.**

“to speak evil of no man”, (**blasphemeo**), “to injure someone's
reputation; to slander; to defame; to blaspheme; to malign”

Remember in Titus 2:3 the older woman was to be “not a false accuser”.
This is the same word, and the command is directed at all believers.

The Word of God has a lot of teaching about sins of the tongue. He seems
to know us very well.

The concept of sin in the Bible is actually put there for our benefit,
not God's. He is, after all, perfect in His infinite righteousness. And
he knows each of us individually and perfectly.

Because He loves us, God wants us to experience blessing and peace and
happiness in this life, and He knows what it takes to produce this. He
knows that sin interrupts His will for Christians, because it disturbs a
person's progress, growht, and prosperity, and that of others.

For example, sinful pride produces self-centeredness and blinds us to
worth in others. Envy, jealousy, and covetousness rob a Christian of
happiness.

Hatred and vindictiveness rule out real love for others. Drunkenness
destroys rapport with God and man. Fornication defrauds, steals, lies
because it does not deliver what it promises.

The slandering of other people is a symptom of deep mental hatred and
evidence of a lack of adjustment to God's will and plan for other
people. It is an act that is the direct opposite of the loving care for
others that leads to personal evangelism and Christian fellowship.

“to be no brawlers”, (**amaxos**) - “peaceable”, meaning “not to fight;
not to quarrel, not to wrangle.”

This is not the “brawler” of Titus 1:7. There, the Greek word is
(**pleikteis**), which refers to a bully or one who goes around looking
for fights.

In this verse the term is more general and more indicative of the
peaceable mental attitude of a person who is not looking for trouble,
and it could equally apply to non-physical confrontations.

We see examples of the \*lack\* of this quality all around us in the
world. In many people envy, hatred, venom is barely hidden behind a very
thin facade. We see it in debates between religious leaders, in
confrontations between politicians - the poorly concealed disdain and
hatred people have for each other.

The Lord expects the Christian to be moving away from this type of life.
This quality of peaceableness is commanded of all Christians.

“but gentle”, (**epieikeis**) - “fair; moderate; kind; forbearing;
forgiving; not insisting on strict justice”.

Phil. 4:5, “Let you moderation (**epieikeis**) be known unto all men.
The Lord is at hand.”

James 3:16,17 “For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and
every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
peaceable, gentle (**epieikeis**), and easy to be intreated, full of
mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and with hypocrisy.”

### Topic: Forgiveness

Some of the benefits of a gentle, forgiving spirit:

A great savings in emotional energy.

Minimum time living carnally, maximum time in divine production.

Relief from an assumed burden - a spin off of the prosperity package.

Protection from divine discipline (chastisement) for mental attitude
sin.

Leaves one in position to be of service to to offender.

Is a great testimony to those who would have acted differently.

“showing all meekness”

The word “showing” is (**endeiknumi**), “to demonstrate; to display; to
give proof of (in law)”.

The word “meekness” is (**prauteis**), meaning “courtesy;
considerateness accompanied by humility”.

Here, the Christian is commanded to “demonstrate consideration for
others in the frame of mind of true humility.”

The word “meekness” does not carry this meaning in modern American
speech. A Christian man or woman can have great self-confidence, can
walk erect, can be well organized and forceful, yet can manifest great
courtesy and consideration based on a Grace attitude in all things.

True humility is not in giving an appearance of humiliation. True
humility is the realization of God's gracious provision of everything
that we have, and that we have not earned or deserved even one good
thing.

“unto all men” - the evangelical imperative.

In order for us to have respectful listeners when we witness or teach
requires that we have these personal characteristics shown in our
outlook toward other people and in our responses to others.

Titus 3:3
---------

**For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived,
serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,
and hating one another.**

“For we ourselves also”

Here is Paul's description of his own life before salvation (and perhaps
he is reminding Titus of the same thing\~). These comments are a
description of relying on the pseudo-provision that the world offers.

Read Romans 6:1-23

The plea in the first two verses of this chapter, that Christians be
forbearing, merciful, considerate of others, is \*reinforced\* here by
pointing out that all of us are products of Grace, and recipients of
mercy, so we ought to remember where we came from and what God has
brought us out of.

St. Paul never forgets Grace and his own total dependency on the Lord.

Read Romans 7:19-25; 8:1-13 for a contrast of the old life with the new
life in Christ. These two chapters in Romans are a blueprint for exalted
living on this earth.

There is the paramount consideration of personal volition in all of
this; we choose every day whom we will serve, whether God or mammon.

Matt. 6:24, “No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the
one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise
the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.”

Joshua 24:14 ff, “Now, therefore, fear the Lord, and serve him in
sincerity and truth [volition plus doctrine]: and put away the gods
which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt;
and serve ye the Lord.

And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom
you will serve; whether the gods which you fathers served that were on
the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land
you dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.”

“were sometimes foolish”, (**anoetos**), “were once unwise”.

To be wise, a person must experience salvation through belief in Christ.
Wisdom is part of the salvation package.

Read Ephesians 1:7-12

But wisdom must be obtained. “ ... let him ask of God.”

Read Col. 1:9-13

“disobedient”, (**apeitheis**), “disobedient”.

Not obedient to authority, in this case, not responsive to God's
authority.

“deceived”, the \*passive\* voice of (**planoo**) - “to be led astray;
to be deluded”

This is characteristic of the naive, the immature, the child. This is
great gullibility.

Ephesians 4:11-15 shows that there is an antidote for gullibility. The
mechanism to counter deception, and to remove spiritual ignorance, is
set up. Those with spiritual gifts of communications teach believers so
that they “grow up into Christ” and so that the church operates as a
mature organization.

It takes great effort to become discerning, wise, “sophisticated” in
life. Satan is a great con man, a carnival barker, offering something
for nothing, but loading the dice “the sleight of men and cunning
craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive.”

“serving diverse lusts and pleasures”

Reference to slavery to the details of life, which may include quite
legitimate things which we desire, as well as the sinful things of the
world.

“living”, (**diago**) - “to spend one's life doing something” ...

in this case, wallowing in patterns of sinful mental activity, described
in the following words.

“in malice”, (**kakia**) - “ill-will; malignity; maliciousness”

This is from a word which, in the moral sense, means “badness;
depravity; wickedness.” Believers need to be warned about this, it is
not restricted to non-believers.

Read 1 Peter 2:15,16

“and envy”, (**phthnos**) - “jealousy”

A result of covetousness. This sin occurs in many of the catalogues of
vices in the New Testament, notably in Romans 1:29.

Comment: how easy it is to place great emphasis on the homosexuality
described in Romans 1, and ignore all of the other areas of weakness to
which we all are subject. The warnings of Romans 2 regarding
self-righteous judging are directed at this tendency to focus on the
sins of other people.

“hateful”, (**stugetos**), “filled with hate”

This could be considered a “spinoff” sin, or a sin resulting from a
chain of sinning. For example: pride leads to envy; envy leads to
bitterness; bitterness leads to hatred. A person can commit a lot of
sins in a brief period of time.

“and hating one another”, (**miseo**) - “active pursuit of hatred
towards another; detestation; abhorrence”

This word carries the connotation of venom toward others. This Greek
root is found in the English “misanthrope; misogamist; misogynist”.

This is the end of Lesson 11. In order to lift our eyes out of Satan's
world and the depressing sight of our own weaknesses, let us now read
Titus 3:4-7 as an uplifting exercise.

Titus 3:4
---------

**But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man
appeared,**

“But after that” - “but when”

Here is the contrast with our past life. What we have become, in
contrast to what we once were, gives a powerful motive for godly living.

What we are is no cause for celebration! Any change for the better is
the result of God's salvation given freely and to those who had done
nothing to earn or deserve His mercy.

In these verses we have the source (v. 4), the basis (v. 5a), the means
(vv. 5b, 6), and the result (v. 7) of salvation.

“the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man”

This is the historical starting point of our salvation. These are the
two aspects of the grace mentioned in 2:11.

His “kindness” is (**chreistoteis**) - “goodness; gentleness; kindness;
virtue”

Kindness, or gentleness, is the practical outworking of God's grace
thinking; He thinks grace at all times. In this case, “kindness” is
God's mental attitude of love toward the human race.

It is through His goodness that we see God's grace attitude.

Ephesians 2:7 “That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding
riches of his grace in his kindness (chreistotei\~) toward us through
Christ Jesus.”

But some people despise God's goodness.

Romans 4:4 “Do you despise the riches of his goodness (**chreistoteis**)
and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God
leads you to repentance?”

Through His goodness, God is always ready to bestow blessing and
forgiveness.

His “love toward man” is (**philanthropia**) - “love of mankind;
benevolence”

This word when used for a human being means “humanitarianism”.

On the part of God, (**philanthropia**) refers to His infinite divine
love for all people, out of His perfect divine character.

See John 3:16

John 15:13 “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
life for his friend.”

Contrast this divine attitude to the human disposition portrayed in
verse 3. We see that God hates the sinner's sin, but He loves the
sinner, and He longs to save him. God is the great Philanthropist.

And true human philanthropy is based on divine love.

“The goodness and love of God to man, on which our salvation is based,
should lead us to show benevolence and gentleness to all men.” (John
Huther, “Critical and Exegetical Handbook to the Epistles of St. Paul to
Timothy and Titus.”)

“appeared”, (**epiphaino**) - “has been revealed; has been caused to
appear” (the verb in the aorist passive indicative)

The noun form is (**epiphaneia**) - “appearance; manifestation; glorious
display”

Read 2 Tim. 1:9,10

Compare Titus 2:11

The implication here is that these characteristics of God were always
there but that there was a distinct manifestation of them in the coming
of Christ, leading to a proclamation of the Gospel.

Glimpses of these attributes of God are seen in the Old Testament,
certainly, but it was especially in the announcement to the world of
salvation in Christ that the kindness and love of God are brought fully
to the world's attention. He now stands revealed as our Savior.

### Topic: Essence of God (Divine Attributes; The Character of God)

Titus 3:5
---------

**Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the
Holy Ghost;**

“Not by works of righteousness which we have done”

The phrase “he saved us” in this verse states that the act of salvation
is an accomplished fact. The word “us” indicates all those who have
accepted Christ as Savior. Although salvation is not complete, and
awaits its total summing up at the return of Christ, it is the present
possession of all those who by faith have been united to Christ.

### Topic: Union with Christ

Paul states both the negative and positive of the salvation process.

Salvation IS NOT by our works of personal righteousness. We did no works
which merited or called forth God's salvation or which were acceptable
to God in the sphere of righteousness. “Not of works, lest anyone should
boast.”

Salvation IS by the grace of God through regeneration and renewal.
Salvation lies entirely in God. He was moved with compassion for us
sinners; He acted out of love to originate and bring about our
salvation.

“by the washing of regeneration”.

The word translated “washing” is (**loutron**) which appears only in one
other place in the New Testament, Ephesians 5:26. It means either “the
place or water in which a bath is taken” or “the act of bathing or
washing”.

In Ephesians 5:26, the Bible speaks of the cleansing of the church “by
the washing of water with the word.” The cleansing is brought about by
applying the Word of God to the heart and conscience.

There are other passages where the Word of God is said to be applied to
bring about salvation (1 Peter 1:23: James 1:18).

So, as the Word of God is applied to the heart, under the Holy Spirit's
ministry of revelation and conviction, when a person believes in Christ
regeneration is brought about by the Spirit. Regeneration is the initial
experience of salvation, brought about in a person at the moment faith
is placed in Jesus Christ and His work on the Cross.

Some commentators regard the “washing” as a reference to water baptism.
Even if this interpretation is allowed, then baptism must be interpreted
as the outward sign of the inner experience. Baptism is the consequent
testimony of the spiritual washing (by the Word) that has taken place.

In the New Testament, water baptism is the outward symbol of the inner
spiritual reality. Apart from the inner reality, the outward symbol has
no value. Paul asserts this truth in relation to circumcision (Rom.
2:25-29).

“regeneration” expresses a new state of things. The Greek word
(paliggenesia\~) occurs elsewhere only in Matthew 19:28, where it refers
to the rebirth of external nature and creation at the revelation of
Christ in glory. Here it refers to the rebirth of the soul, the “born
again” of John 3.

### Topic: Regeneration

“and renewing of the Holy Spirit”

The statement on this phrase comes from “Titus and Philemon” by D.
Edmond Hiebert, Moody Press, 1957. [with which I concur. wd]

“Grammatically, two constructions are possible of the words 'the washing
of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.' One view regards both
'regeneration' and 'renewing' as dependent on the word 'washing.' (See
the text of the American Standard Version.) On this view the
regeneration is further described as the renewing of the Holy Spirit,
both pointing to the same divine act.

“The other construction holds that the preposition “through” governs
both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.
This give us two facts instead of just one. The renewing work of the
Holy Spirit, begun at regeneration, is then viewed as continuing in the
life of the believer. We prefer this view. It is the reading given in
the margin, and implied by the comma, in the King James.

“In Ephesians 5:26 the mention of the cleansing of the church is
supplemented by the thought of the sanctification of the church till
there shall be no spot or blemish. In Romans 12:2 this renewal is
presented as a continuing experience. It is the development and
extension of the regeneration initiating the new life. It is the
continuing work of the Spirit.”

Titus 3:6
---------

**Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior;**

All three Persons of the Trinity are present and cooperating in the word
of Grace. Each Person has His function in the salvation of our soul.

Here, the Holy Spirit was made abundantly available to us to perform His
function in the regeneration and renewal process.

### Topic: The Holy Spirit

Titus 3:7
---------

**That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according
to the hope of eternal life.**

“That being justified”

Justification is God's act of grace by which He pardons a sinner and
declares him righteous on account of the atoning work of Jesus Christ on
the Cross. Remission of sin, absolution from guilt, and freedom from
punishment are part of justification.

Justification is an act of God's grace. It begins in His free, unmerited
favor, and it is given to us as part of our union with Christ by faith.

In order to be justified, a person must be given a righteousness
equivalent to God's perfect righteousness. Hence, imputation precedes
justification.

Imputation is the charging to the account of one person something which
properly belongs to another. The Lord Jesus Christ shares his perfect
righteousness with the believer, Rom. 3:22; 4:11; 9:30-32; 4:4,5 \*\*.

### Topic: Imputation

### Topic: Justification

Because righteousness has been imputed to us, God calls us “justified”.
“Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness.”
Hence, imputation of righteousness on the basis of faith brings about
justification.

The means of justification is redemption, Rom. 3:24. “Being justified
freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”

### Topic: Redemption

Justification produces reconciliation. Rom. 5:1

Because God the Father is satisfied (propitiation), we are freely
justified.

Justification occurs at the moment of a person's faith in Jesus Christ,
Rom. 3:28; 5:1; Gal.3:24.

Justification does not occur through keeping the Law of Moses, Gal.
2:16.

Justification during the believer's lifetime is described in James
2:21-25. This is the function of the Faith-Rest principle in living the
Christian Way of Life under grace.

The principle of temporal justification is found in Matt. 11:19 and Luke
7:35.

“we should be made heirs”

We are heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ. This is not only a future
hope, but it is also a present reality. We are heirs of eternal life,
but we are not entirely in actual possession of it. We will receive our
full inheritance when Christ comes for His Church.

Jesus Christ, as the Son of God, and as the victor in the spiritual
conflict, is the heir of all things. Heb. 1:1-4

Inheritance is based on sonship:

John 1:12, But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,

Rom. 8:16,17, The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we
are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and
fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him in order that we
may also be glorified with Him.

Gal. 3:26-29, For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves
with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in
Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's
offspring, heirs according to promise.

To inherit from God, a person must possess the life of God, that is,
salvation resulting in eternal life.

1 John 5:11,12 And the witness is this, that God has given us eternal
life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he
who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.

Therefore, salvation is the qualification for inheriting from God.

Col. 1:9-14

We have an inheritance because we share the destiny of Christ. The true
doctrine of predestination is that we share Christ's destiny.

Eph. 1:11 “also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined
according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His
will,”

As joint-heirs with Christ, we also share Christ's election.

Heb. 9:15, And for this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, in
order that since a death has taken place for the redemption of the
transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who
have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.

Our heritage is a Christian's permanent possession.

1 Pet. 1:3-5, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a
living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to
obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not
fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the power of
God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is the down payment on our
inheritance.

Eph. 1:14

Abraham's inheritance is the pattern and illustration of the heritage of
believers.

Rom. 4:9-16

“according to the hope of eternal life”

or, “according to confidence in eternal life”

See the discussion of hope (elpi\~) in Lesson 1, Titus 1:2

### Topic: Hope

Titus 3:8
---------

**This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm
constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to
maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto them.**

Paul draws a striking relationship between high spiritual doctrine and
the conduct that is expected.

First he says, “these truths are reliable and trustworthy.” Then he
urges Titus to “affirm them confidently.” The objective is that doctrine
clearly taught, and accepted by faith, will produce good works in the
lives of the hearers.

Right beliefs must result in fruit in the Christian life. Good works are
a logical and necessary result of true learning of the principles of the
grace of God. And this fact must be emphasized to those “who have
believed God,” the people whose faith has brought them into a personal
relationship with the Lord Himself.

Christians must give serious thought to this obligation and be
outstanding in the practice of good works. “These things are excellent
in themselves as spiritual truth, and as such they are valuable for good
and holy living.”

Titus 3:9
---------

**But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.**

“But avoid...” - “to shun; to turn oneself around”

Compare the idea of “profitable” in verse 8 with the “unprofitable”
things of verse 9.

The words “foolish questions, genealogies, contentions, strivings about
the law” indicate the content and spirit of the heretical Jewish
teaching on Crete which was the subject of Titus 1:14. This is not a
reference to the legitimate study of the Law and the Prophets, the Old
Testament scriptures which are so rich in content for all Christians.

The “gainsayers”, the false teachers, were concerned with silly
questions, with filling in the genealogies of the Old Testament with
fictitious people and spinning stories about them. Such teaching simply
promoted argument and strife.

These are “vain” activities, “empty” exercises which are useless,
morally fruitless, and not worthy of time and serious consideration.

Titus 3:10
----------

**A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition
reject:**

A heretic is a factious person (hairetiko\~). This is the only place the
word appears in the New Testament. It means a person who is quarrelsome
and stirs up factions through promotion oferroneous opinions. The
heretic is determined to go his own way and to take others with him, so
he forms parties, cliques, conspiracies. His self-chosen opinions are
outlined in verse 9.

It is not heresy to be wrong about doctrine, or to be in error.
Otherwise, we would all be heretics at one time or another. The heretic
in this verse is an activist who does not respond to careful and loving
teaching (speaking, exhorting, and rebuking). He is rebellious and is
trying to raise a following.

Titus is commanded to give the heretic every encouragement and
opportunity, “a first and second admonition.” He is to be reprimanded
once and again with straight talk. If this fails, then the heretic is to
be “rejected” that is, Titus is to “refuse” him, to have nothing to do
with him. He is to be left to himself.

Factious men are often pushed into prominence by the attacks of
Christians upon them, whereas, if they were left alone, they would of
themselves come to nothing.

However, remember, that a very different rule of action is called for in
cases where the error is not foolish, but vital and fundamental, or
where the offense involves immorality. See 1 Cor. 5:1-13; 1 Tim.
1:19,20.

### Topic: Heresy and Apostasy

Titus 3:11
----------

**Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
condemned of himself.**

“Knowing that” means that the heretic's refusal to listen has shown
Titus what the man is.

As to his character, he is shown to be “subverted”, or “perverted”, in
the process of “being twisted”, or turned out of the right way. His
refusal to heed strong teaching shows that his error is of the heart, as
well as of the mind.

As to his conduct, he “sins” and goes on sinning, both by his
divisiveness and his refusal to listen to admonition.

Therefore he is “self-condemned.” He may not be conscious of his
condemnation, but by his actions he passes judgment upon himself.

The following discussion of this passage has portions taken from “Titus
and Philemon”, by D. Edmond Hiebert, Moody Press, Chicago, 1957.

Titus 3:12
----------

**When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come
unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.**

The conclusion is devoted largely to personal matters. Paul indicates
his plans for the future activities of Titus, and he lays on him the
immediate obligation to assist Zenas and Apollos. The thought of
material assistance is related more generally to the Cretan Christians.

Artemas is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, so we have no
information about this man. He is obviously a trusted worker, in the
same class as Tychicus. Artemas and Tychicus were evidently available as
replacements for Titus on Crete, and were to be sent by Paul to relieve
Titus in his duties.

Tychicus was one of Paul's close associates. He was a native of the
province of Asia (Acts 20:4) and probably accompanied Paul to Jerusalem
on the third missionary journey.

When Paul was imprisoned in Rome the first time, he chose Tychicus to
carry the epistles to Ephesus and Colosse (Eph. 6:21; Col. 4:7). In
Colossians Paul calls Tychicus “the beloved brother and faithful
minister and fellow servant in the Lord.” From 2 Timothy 4:12 we learn
that Paul sent him on a subsequent mission to Ephesus.

The verb “shall send” is in the subjunctive, indicating an indefinite
clause, so that Paul had not yet decided when either of the two men
would be sent to Crete. Titus was to remain as his post until his
replacements arrived.

Paul requests Titus to join him at Nicopolis (“city of victory”). There
were a number of cities of that name in the Mediterranean region. The
city here is probably the one on the Ambracian Gulf in Epirus, built by
Augustus to celebrate the Roman victory at the battle of Actium. Paul
was not at Nicopolis when he wrote the letter to Titus, because he said
“I have determined there to winter.” We do not know where he was at the
time of writing, perhaps in Achaia or Macedonia. But Paul was at liberty
to go to Nicopolis, so we know that the letter was written after his
release from his first Roman imprisonment.

Titus 3:13
----------

**Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that
nothing be wanting unto them.**

“Bring” is actually “set forward”.

Here we get an impression of Paul as a great spiritual leader, moving
his “troops” into strategic position. And Titus is to have a part in
furthering that work. Zenas and Apollos are on a journey which has
evidently taken them by Crete; they may have carried the letter which we
are studying. Titus now is to “set them forward” on their journey and to
meet their needs for the travel.

We know nothing further of Zenas, except that he was a lawyer. His name
is Greek, so he may have been a practitioner of Roman law and was now
using his abilities in spreading the Gospel. He may have been a Jewish
Christian, however, with a Greek name, and expert in Jewish law.

Apollos was the eloquent preacher from Alexandria whom Aquila and
Priscilla instructed more fully in the way of the Lord at Ephesus.

### Topic: Apollos

### Topic: Aquila and Priscilla

Titus 3:14
----------

**And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses,
that they be not unfruitful.**

These are instructions concerning the Cretan Christians. I believe there
is a flavor here of Titus' turning to the local congregations to help
with the needs of Zenas and Apollos. It was a good opportunity to
cultivate a missionary spirit in the Cretan believers, and to learn to
practice Christian giving.

This is a further reminder to them, and to us, that the Christian life
is not in hearing only, but in doing the “good works which God has
before ordained...” (Eph. 6:10)

Titus 3:15
----------

“**All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the
faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.**

There must have been a number of others with Paul when he wrote this
epistle, probably fellow workers. As believers, the Cretans loved Paul
and the other missionaries and that love bound them together. It was a
love operating in the sphere of faith, so the reference is to the love
which is the fruit of the Holy Spirit.

Paul ends with a prayer that God's grace will be with all his friends
and associates on Crete.

Topical Studies
===============

Anger
-----

Everybody gets angry. (Well, I do, anyhow, and I suppose other people
do, too.)

We know that we all have sin natures that have areas of strength and
weakness. You may be strong where I am weak, and vice-versa. So it may
be that you would never think of committing a particular sin that I
might be having a great deal of trouble with.

But, in one way or another everyone has problems with anger. Sometimes
the anger is a quiet, seething resentment or indignation at some large
or small offense, real or imagined. Sometimes anger explodes into a rage
that can turn into retaliation, violence, or murder.

When we are angry we hurt people, usually those who are closest to us.
And we really hurt ourselves; an angry person is his own worst enemy, as
we shall see in this topical study.

But Christians can have victory over the sin of anger! This study is
written to lay out what the Bible says about anger and to answer
questions like the following:

What’s the difference between sinful anger and righteous indignation?

Does God get angry?

What causes me to get angry, and what can I do about it?

How can I have victory over the sin of anger?

**Definition**

The Bible describes anger as a sin - a sin of mental attitude. As a sin,
anger expresses antagonism, exasperation, indignation, resentment,
outrage. Anger often produces an emotional feeling, but the feeling is
not the anger. The thought pattern which produced the feeling is the
sinful anger.

In the Bible, the type of anger which is not sinful is more properly
called “righteous indignation”.

The Bible uses two Greek words for anger: orge, referring to mental
anger, and thumos, for mental anger. It’s possible, but not common, to
have mental anger without an emotional response. In Eph. 4:31, both
types of anger are related to bitterness.

Anger is a sin which promotes sins against other people, such as gossip,
self-righteous judging, maligning, complaining.

Both anger and righteous indignation are mental reactions to events or
circumstances. If the mental reaction is unjustifiable, it becomes an
emotional reaction such as irritation or exasperation, and may lead to
irrationality.

But if a reaction is justifiable, it is never irrational. An example
would be righteous indignation regarding heresy.

Righteous **Indignation**

**Righteous** indignation is not sinful anger. It is a clear
understanding of a bad situation because you have a clear understanding
(from the Bible) of what God thinks about. Therefore, there is no
reaction which leads to anger and sin.

In Mark 10:14, Jesus became opposed to the disciples when they forbade
the children to be brought unto Him. This was not anger, it was an
understanding of a wrong.

Jesus expressed righteous indignation in Matt. 23:13-36 when he
condemned the scribes and Pharisees. And He wasn’t angry when He told
Peter “Get behind me, Satan, you are a stumbling block to me. You have
not concentrated on the things of God, but on the tings of man.”

Another example of righteous indignation is a Christian’s mental
attitude toward criminal activity. You can pursue, prosecute, and
sentence a criminal without compromising such principles as grace,
forgiveness, or impersonal love. You are aware that the criminal’s act
is wrong and that he must be stopped. That is righteous indignation. But
you don’t hate the criminal or fall apart emotionally because of sinful
anger. Impersonal love is a result of Christian growth and allows
believers to have a regard for even the most obnoxious people that does
not depend on their character or behavior.

It is righteous indignation that allows God to be “angry” about sin but
to love us anyway. His love for us depends on His character, not on
ours.

**Characteristics of Sinful Anger**

Anger is sin from the sin nature. Gal. 5:19-21, “Now the deeds of the
flesh [sin nature] are evident, which are: immorality, impurity,
sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of
anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing,
and things like these...”

Anger is related to foolishness. Eccl. 7:9, “Do not be quick to be angry
in your heart, for anger resides in the bosom of fools.”

The Bible defines a fool as a person without divine wisdom. He may be a
genius, but his thinking is from human viewpoint. He thinks and acts
apart from God’s standards and controls. The paramount fool (and the
beginning of foolishnes\~) is the person who has “said in his heart,
There is no God.”

Look at Romans 1:18-31 for a detailed description of the results of
deliberately turning away from God. A fool is on a rapid downward slide
towards destruction, both in this life and the one to come. In the list
of terrible sins which characterize the ungodly are several which are
either causes or results of anger.

Anger is associated with grieving the Holy Spirit. Eph. 4:30-31, “And do
not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day
of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and
slander be put away from you, along with all malice. And be kind to one
another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ
also has forgiven you.” Notice the contrast here between conditions of
anger and the results of impersonal love.

Anger is a violation of the Christian’s code of conduct as a member of
the Body of Christ. Col. 3:8,9, “But now you also, put them all aside:
anger, wrath, malice, slander, {and} abusive speech from your mouth. Do
not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its
{evil} practices”

Anger hinders effective prayer. 1 Tim. 2:8, “Therefore I want the men in
every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and
dissension.”

Anger is always accompanied by other sins. Prov. 29:22, “An angry person
stirs up strife, and a hot tempered person abounds in transgression.”

Anger promotes the sins of gossip, self-righteous judging, maligning,
revenge, complaining, bitterness, and many others. Heb. 12:15, “See to
it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of
bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled.”

Anger makes a person his own worst enemy; he brings misery upon himself.
Prov. 22:8, “He who sows iniquity will reap vanity, And the rod of his
fury will perish.” The uphappiness comes from many sources: failure to
be occupied with Christ, failure to maintain a relaxed mental attitude,
failure to be controlled by the Holy Spirit, thus, failure to grow in
Christ. Lack of growth means lack of joy, lack of love, lack of divine
viewpoint.

Anger promotes jealousy and cruelty. Prov. 27:4.

Anger causes misery for loved ones, friends, and community. Anger
destroys a nation. Prov. 21:19; 22:24; 24:25; 29:22. Amos 1:11, “Thus
says the Lord, "For three transgressions of Edom and for four I will not
revoke its {punishment}, Because he pursued his brother with the sword,
While he stifled his compassion; His anger also tore continually, And he
maintained his fury forever.”

**Other Bible Teaching on Anger**

Eph. 4:26 says “Be ye angry, and sin not.” or “Although you may have
become angry, stop sinning.”

This verse is quoted from Psalm 4, which is about David’s righteous
indignation at the revolt of his son Absalom. He is resisting the
temptation to become angry. “Tremble with anger, yet do not sin.” He was
tempted to become angry at Absalom because Abaslom had used his position
to start a revolution against his father. but he didn’t become angry, he
trusted the Lord (Occupation with Christ), and he asked the army to
spare Absalom. 2 Sam. 18:5.

It is possible to respond to unfairness or offense without sin. A person
may sin against you, yet you can remain without sin. You can put the
matter in the Lord’s hands, stay in fellowship, and maintain a relaxed
mental attitude. Furthermore, because you stay in fellowship, you are in
the best position to be of service in the situation. You can forgive the
other person and be open to any reconciliation he might offer. You will
at least do your part to keep lines of communication open.

The Bible continually emphasizes righteousness maintained in the face of
unfair treatment.

You cannot build your happiness on someone else’s misery. This is what
retailiation tries to do. But you’ll never obtain happiness through
revenge or by straightening out the other person. To punish someone else
using verbal sins or violence is a revenge operation; worse yet, it
obstructs divine judgment and discipline. “Judge not, that you be not
judged” is intended to warn us to let The Lord handle matters of sins
against Himself. The angry person who arrogates to himself the position
of judge is in a position of compounded divine discipline himself, worse
off than the one who originally caused the trouble.

**The Anger of the Lord**

The Lord is said to have anger, or to be angry, in several places in the
Bible. The word “anger” is used as an anthropopathism, a word or phrase
that ascribes human characteristics or feelings to God, who is not
human. God never reacts emotionally. He is never surprised, shocked, or
outraged. But He does have an attitude of wrath or anger against some
things.

The phrase “the anger of the Lord” is used in the following passages:

Num. 25:4; 32:14; Deut. 29:20; Judg 3:8; 10:7; 2:14, 20; 2 Kings 24:20;
Lam. 4:16; Jer. 4:8,25,37; 30:24; 51:45; 52:3; Zeph. 2:2,3; Psalm 2:5.

The phrase “the wrath of God” is used in the following:

2 Chron. 28:11; Ezra 10:14; Psalm 78:31; John 3:36; Rom. 1:18; Eph. 5:6;
Col. 3:6; Rev. 14:10,19; 15:1,7; 16:1; 19:15.

Victory Over the Sin of Anger

Recognize the sin of anger and confess to the Lord when you become
angry. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us
our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” I John 1:9. This
will help you maintain your walk with the Lord and be controlled
(filled) by the Holy Spirit.

Continue to “grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ.” Forgiveness is an important part of grace being used by a
believer. The more you are oriented to God’s plan of Grace, the more
adept you will be at using the assets He provides.

Practice trusting God (or, using Faith). God says, “Cast your care on
Me, because I care for you.” When you are in bad situations, tell the
Lord about it and let Him handle it.

Apollos
-------

The New Testament character Apollos was a well-educated man from the
city of Alexandria in Egypt. He was well acquainted with the Old
Testament scriptures and was familiar with John the Baptist's teachings.
About A.D. 56 he came to Ephesus where he began to teach in the
synagogue "the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John".

Aquila and his wife Priscilla were at the church in Ephesus and heard
Apollos speaking. They took him aside and provided him with doctrinal
teaching to bring him up to date about Christ, the Cross, the
Resurrection, etc. After this, Apollos went to preach in Achaia,
especially at Corinth, having been highly recommended by the Ephesian
Christians. He was very effective in representing the claims of Christ
to the Jews.

Acts 18:24-28 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth,
an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures.
This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent
in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning
Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John; and he began to
speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard
him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more
accurately. And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren
encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he
had arrived, he helped greatly those who had believed through grace; for
he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the
Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.

Acts 19:1 And it came about that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found some
disciples,

In Corinth, Apollos was also very useful in "watering" the spiritual
seed which Paul had planted. He was obviously a skilled teacher of Bible
truth and much appreciated by the believers there. Unfortunately, many
of the Corinthian believers became so attached to him that they produced
a schism in the church, with some taking Apollos' part, some Paul's, and
some staying out of the conflict. But it is obvious that Apollos did not
encourage this party feeling, seen in the approving way Paul speaks of
him and in the fact that Apollos did not want to return to Corinth when
he was with Paul at Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:12).

1 Cor. 1:12 Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, "I am of
Paul," and "I of Apollos," and "I of Cephas," and "I of Christ."

1 Cor. 3:4-6 For when one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I am of
Apollos," are you not {mere} men? What then is Apollos? And what is
Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave
{opportunity} to each one. I planted, Apollos watered, but God was
causing the growth.

1 Cor. 3:22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or
death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you,

1 Cor. 4:6 Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to
myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to
exceed what is written, in order that no one of you might become
arrogant in behalf of one against the other.

1 Cor. 16:12 But concerning Apollos our brother, I encouraged him
greatly to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all his
desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.

Paul mentions Apollos again in Titus 3:13 and recommends him and Zenas
the lawyer to Titus, knowing that they intended to visit Crete.

Titus 3:13 Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so
that nothing is lacking for them.

Jerome (a church father) believed that Apollos remained in Crete until
he had heard that the divisions in Corinth had been healed, and that he
returned and became bishop of that city.

Aquila and Priscilla
--------------------

Aquila and his wife Priscilla were Jews and natives of Pontus. Their
occupation was tentmaking. They had fled from Rome to Corinth when the
emperor Claudius had commanded all Jews to leave that city. When Paul
came to Corinth, he found them and stayed with them for some time,
working with them at the trade of tentmaking.

Later, when Paul was opposed by the Jews, and perhaps to remove any
obstacle to his reception by the Gentiles, he left the house of Aquila
and dwelled with a man named Justus.

It is not clear when Aquila and Priscilla became Christians, but it was
certainly before Paul left Corinth, because they traveled with him to
Ephesus. Paul was able to teach them a great deal about Christ in a
short time, because we see Aquila and Priscilla giving instruction to
Apollos in Ephesus (Acts 18). They appear to have been zealous promoters
of the cause of Christ in Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:19).

Acts 18:2 And he [Paul] found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of
Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because
Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them,

Acts 18:18 And Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the
brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and
Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow.

Acts 18:26 and he [Apollos] began to speak out boldly in the synagogue.
But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and
explained to him the way of God more accurately.

Aquila and Priscilla later returned to Rome, and their home there was a
place of assembly for believers. See Romans 16:3 and following verses.

Some years after that they seem to have returned to Ephesus, because
Paul sends salutations to them there during his second imprisonment at
Rome (2 Tim. 4:19), as being with Timothy.

Authority
---------

Introduction

Authority: The power to influence or command thought, opinion, or
behavior. Persons in command.

The most important earthly influence in a person's life is that which
comes from his relationship with his parents. The newborn child enters
life completely dependent upon, and completely subservient to, an
all-powerful authority, his mother and father. As a child grows, he
adjusts continuously in his responses to that parental authority, for
better or for worse depending on the training he receives. He also
gradually becomes aware of other influences of authority in society;
those of his schools, of the various levels of government and law
enforcement, of the people for whom he works, of his church, and of the
authority of God Himself.

As an adult, a person often has two roles simultaneously. He is not only
subject to authority of various kinds all of his lifetime, but he may
also himself be in a position of power and influence over others,
perhaps as parent, military officer, executive, or judge. A person's
ability to respond properly to authority, and his ability to exercise
authority, depend on his orientation to divine principles of authority
categorized in the Bible. As least three things are necessary to the
proper response to authority. They are:

Careful training by parents in correct standards of submission to
authority

A consistent daily walk with the Lord

An ever-growing categorical knowledge of Biblical principles of
authority accompanied by personal acceptance of the teaching leading to
personal application in the life.

When any of these factors is missing, a person will accept non-Biblical,
humanistic principles of leadership, or the response to leadership, with
the usually bad results that derive from a poor understanding of
Scriptural standards.

This paper explores the subject of authority in several ways. First we
examine the source of all spiritual and temporal authority, God the
Creator. The Bible is the textbook for the study. God has delegated
authority to His Son, Jesus Christ, Who, in turn, has passed certain
leadership responsibilities to human beings, the apostles. The apostles
retained this mantle of authority as they were given the divine enabling
to write the Word of God for believers to read and understand.

The next consideration in this discussion is the Biblical teaching on a
variety of types of authority, including parental, governmental, and
ecclesiastical authority. Finally, the paper will describe some ways in
which children and young people can be trained in Biblical principles of
authority and in the proper responses to and uses of leadership. There
will be a few paragraphs in the final section about Chain of Command
which is intended to show believers the mechanics of a proper
relationship to both divine and human authority.

THE SOURCE OF AUTHORITY IN CHRISTIANITY

In all Christian activity some form of authority is exercised, either
the authority of one individual over others, or the authority of an
organization over individuals. The administration of leadership takes on
so many varied forms that believers often become confused as to what
constitutes legitimate Biblical authority. Some Christians in positions
of leadership exercise Biblical principles of authority, others use
human standards mixed with divine principles. Any Christian leader who
is not well versed in the Biblical doctrines relating to authority is
likely to use a combination of proper and improper authority.

All correct authority in Christian activity must derive from the
Christian system itself: that is, a Christian leader must find his
credentials of leadership in the Word of God. Authority is of two kinds,
primary and delegated authority.

Primary authority grows out of the relationship of those who have the
right to command and those whose duty it is to obey. The basis of all
primary authority in Christianity is the Person of God. We are His; He
made us. We are the creatures of His hand and the product of His
intelligence. He is our Maker, Preserver, and Benefactor. He, therefore,
has the absolute right to command; and it is our absolute duty to obey
Him. God has seen fit only occasionally to govern man by His personal
and primary authority. He usually delegates authority to others. He
rules by His representatives.

Delegated authority is a right to command and enforce obedience which
can be given to another by the party holding primary authority.

GOD’S PRIMARY AUTHORITY WAS DELEGATED TO THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

The first delegation of authority in Christianity was from God the
Father to God the Son. Hebrews 1:1, "God, who gave to our forefathers
many different glimpses of the truth in the words of the prophets, has
now, at the end of the present age, given us the truth in the Son." And
Jesus said, "The word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's Who
sent me." "No man knows who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom
the Son will reveal Him." Jesus closes His ministry on earth, and leads
off His great commission to the apostles with the statement, "All power
is given unto me in heaven and on earth."

The Son stands nearest the Father in delegated authority. He is the
"brightness of the Father's glory and the express image of His Person."
"It has pleased the Father than in Him should all fullness dwell." When
the Father acknowledged Christ after His baptism, He said, "This is my
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Christ was not only the
delegate of God on earth, he is also the "image of the invisible God,"
and He said to His doubting disciples, "He that hath seen me hath seen
the Father."

There are several important inferences to be drawn from the concept of
the authority of Jesus Christ. First, Jesus Christ is a manifestation of
the power of God. Whether His power is seen in the material world or in
the spiritual, our attention is arrested and our interest is challenged.
God's power is part of life itself. It is the agency through which God's
mind controls matter. It is the hand by which God's purpose takes form
in the world.

There is a difference between power and force. Force startles and
frightens us. Power, when directed by intelligent love, is always
pleasing to us. There is force in a lightning bolt. It shatters the sky,
can kill living beings, cleaves a tree in halt, or burns a building to
the ground. But there is power when an intelligent mind uses electricity
to drive a train or light a city. Jesus Christ, who is God himself, is a
manifestation of the power of God, not of the force of God.

AUTHORITY PASSES TO THE APOSTLES

THE TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY TO THE APOSTLES

As long as Jesus was on earth, He talked with men face to face. Men were
directly under His command, and could claim His promises directly. But
He has passed away from earth and does not rule anymore by His own
direct authority. Just as the Father delegated His authority to the Son,
so Jesus delegated His authority to the apostles.

In John 17 are the following statements:

God gave the Son power over all flesh.

This power was given that He might bestow eternal life on all men.

Eternal life is bestowed through the knowledge of the only true God and
Jesus Christ whom He has sent.

God gave the Son certain men out of the world, that He might teach them
all that God had given him.

All men should believe on Christ through the word of the disciples.

In the transfer of authority from God the Father to the Son there was no
danger of error or mistake. The Son, being divine, could receive without
misunderstanding all that the Father communicated. But the apostles were
human with all the weaknesses and imperfections of their humanity. There
was danger, therefore, that they might not correctly understand or
apprehend the communication which Christ made to them.

It became necessary, therefore, for some power or influence to be
exerted on their minds to preserve them from error either in taking in
or in giving out the lessons which they received. Therefore, Christ
promised them the Holy Spirit, who was to guide them into all truth in
the conveying of the Gospel to the world.

1 Cor. 2:9-13, "Eye has not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered
into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that
love him. But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the
Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. Now, we have
received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God;
that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which
things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but in
words which the Holy Spirit teaches."

THE APOSTLES' USE OF DELEGATED AUTHORITY

The Spirit-guided apostles are the representatives of God on earth for
the purpose of making known His will to the sons of men. Their teaching
is Christ's teaching. Their authority is the authority of the Lord. "As
the Father has sent me, so send I you." So, when the apostles completed
the revelation of the will of God in Jesus Christ, that revelation
became the perfect law of liberty to which nothing could rightfully be
added or taken away.

Anyone who teaches men to disobey the plain commandments of the apostles
cannot be guided by the same Spirit that inspired them to proclaim these
commandments. The same Spirit which led an apostle to proclaim truth
will not lead anyone else to ignore or to disobey that truth.

Any attempt to add to, or subtract from, the words of the apostles, or
to substitute other teaching in the place of their teaching, is not of
God. Satan had no opportunity to corrupt the truth as it proceeded from
the Father to the Son, or from the Son to the apostles. But his
opportunity arrived when the apostles began proclaiming the Gospel to
mankind as they preached. "Those by the wayside are they that hear; then
cometh the devil and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they
should believe and be saved."

THE APOSTLES' EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT

The apostles are administering the authority of God even today, through
the written Word of God which they wrote under divine inspiration. They
began administering that authority on the Day of Pentecost. Their first
judgment was, "These men are not drunk as you suppose, but this is that
spoken of by the prophet Joel..." The world's judgment, that "these men
are full of new wine", was wrong; the apostles' judgment was correct.

The apostles' second judgment was, "This same Jesus whom ye have taken
with wicked hand and slain, God has raised up and made both Lord and
Christ." Their third judgment was concerning convicted sinners, "Repent,
and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto
remission of sins."

Thus, in all their sermons and writings they delivered judgments for
spiritual Israel which stand as authoritative today as when first
delivered. There is nothing that is essential to the well-being of
Christian believers that has not been a subject for the apostles'
judgment. They are ambassadors of Christ. God acted through them and
they represent Christ. "As though God did beseech you by us, we pray in
Christ's place, be ye reconciled to God."

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY

In Dr. G. A. Jacob's book, Ecclesiastical Polity of the New Testament,
there are quotations worth repeating. This book is worth thoughtful
reading, and it shows the trend among some modern Christian thinkers to
get back to the principles of the apostles. From the book:

"The church of the apostolic period is the only church in which there is
found an authority justly claiming the acknowledgement of Christian
bodies in other times. And such authority is found in this church -- not
because it possessed a truer catholicity, or a purer constitution, or a
more primitive antiquity than belong to succeeding ages, for neither
antiquity, purity of form, or catholicity confers any right to govern or
command; but because it was under the immediate rule and guidance of the
apostles. And it is their infallible judgment alone, as exhibited in
this church, which has a legitimate claim to our submission. Of the
church of no other period can the same be said, because the apostles had
no successors to their office. They stand alone as the divinely inspired
teachers, legislators, and rulers in Christ's church and kingdom. They
stand alone as men appointed and commissioned by Christ Himself, and not
by man.

"I appeal, therefore, from the Nicene Fathers to the apostles of Christ;
from patristic literature to the New Testament; from ecclesiastical
authority and practice of post-apostolic centuries to the primitive
church of the apostolic age. To go back to that time, and to endeavor,
as far as possible, to reproduce the church of the New Testament, is
most needful for us now, if we would preserve a faithful and distinct
knowledge of Christian truth among our people. By realizing, as far as
we may, the ideal of that church in our own community, we shall best
maintain its liberty and purity, and we shall best meet the peculiar
dangers of the present time and prepare for the future."

FROM THE APOSTLES TO US - LINES OF AUTHORITY

In the previous section, the transmission of divine authority to human
beings is marked out in three phases: (1) God delegated all authority on
earth to the Son, Jesus Christ; (2) the Son delegated teaching authority
to the apostles; and (3) the apostles wrote authoritatively concerning
the uses of and submission to authority on the part of believers of the
Church Age.

Thus, every standard for the administration of authority over human
beings by other people is derived from the teachings of the apostles as
recorded in the Bible. Because the apostles wrote with the delegated
power of God and were divinely inspired and controlled by the Holy
Spirit of God, we are obliged to give absolute obedience to instructions
from the Bible.

Three types of delegated authority are described in this section: (1)
Authority in Human Society; (2) Ecclesiastical (Local Church) Authority;
and (3) Parental Authority. By careful study of the scripture passages
related to these topics, a believer should be able to gain a great deal
of discernment into the problems of proper response to authority.

AUTHORITY IN HUMAN SOCIETY

The teachings of the Bible indicate that established civil authority is
to be obeyed explicitly except where such obedience would cause the
believer to deviate from direct Bible teaching. That is to say, God does
not delegate any authority that would allow someone to overrule His
expressed commands or to compromise a divine principle. The statement of
Christ, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God
the things that are God's" bears out this principle.

BIBLE REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC TYPES OF AUTHORITY

The authority of the rulers of federal, state, and local government:
Rom. 12: 1 Tim. 2.

The authority of a judge on the bench: 1 Cor. 6:1-8.

The authority of a business owner or executive: Col. 3: Eph. 5: 1 Tim.
6.

The authority of an athletic coach: 1 Cor. 9:24-27.

The authority of the military chain of command: Matt. 8:8-10.

See the following passages also for references to the concept of
authority in many areas of human society:

Matt. 22:19-21; 17:25 27

1 Pet. 2:18

1 Cor. 7:21-24

Eph. 6:5-9

1 Tim. 6:1,2

1 Pet. 2:13-17

Deut. 17:12,13

Rom. 13:1-7.

CHRISTIAN LIFE PRINCIPLES RELATED TO AUTHORITY

Submission to authority means doing the unpleasant thing as well as the
pleasant. Therefore, there is a need for self-discipline. Gal. 5:23 and
2 Thess. 3:8-15 point out that self-control is a result of Christian
growth. The entire book of Proverbs deals extensively with this issue.
The believer can expect that as he grows in Christ his desire to be
submissive to the Lord will grow, as will his ability to be a faithful
servant.

A correct understanding of the concept of authority will cause a
believer to gain respect for the privacy of others. He will learn that
certain aspects of other people's lives do not fall under his
"jurisdiction". So he will be much less inclined to invade privacy,
judge, malign, gossip, etc .

The correct use of Biblical principles of authority also develops in the
believer a respect for other people's personal property. There are many
passages in the Bible about stealing, covetousness, and the protection
of property. Spiritual growth involves an acceptance of these principles
as the believer better understands authority.

Respect for the rights of others to function in their own place under
God's plan is a basic principle of authority. Other people have the
right to make decisions without interference. Mature believers do not
judge others, to not bully others into conforming, do not attempt to
exercise authority which has not been delegated to them. "...to his own
master he stands or falls...".

Ecclesiastical Authority

Scripture references to local church authority are found in Titus
1:4-16; 2:15 – 3:2; 1 Tim. 3:1-7; Matt. 16:16-19; 18:18,19.

Spiritual leaders are not elected, hired, or appointed. They emerge. As
the child of God experiences the development of his spiritual gifts,
these gifts are recognized by others in the Body of Christ. He will be
given a place in which to exercise his gifts.

In Acts 6:1-7, for example, it can be seen that the first deacons were
recognized as spiritually-minded - filled with the Holy Spirit. These
attributes of personal character, the results of years of growth as
believers, were evident in these men's lives. They emerged as leaders.
The vote taken was merely an agreement that the majority of the local
body recognized the mature lives of these men. There may have been
others who coveted places of leadership. But such others were not
recognized. The chosen deacons were selected to serve, not to be served.
Nevertheless, in serving they did great works.

In becoming part of a local church, a Christian tacitly approves of the
leadership structure of that church. By remaining with that
congregation, he signifies that he accepts the pastoral teaching
authority and the leadership of others in authority. The Bible commands
submission to local church authority.

1 Peter 5:5, "Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder.
Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility:
for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble."

To submit means to recognize the chain of command and to refrain from
undermining that authority. This is a command to all believers; and
nearly all trouble in local churches comes from the violation of this
principle. The troublemakers in a church are those who undermine
authority by criticism, by conspiracies, or by other methods. It is the
duty of the pastor-teacher to guard against this and to nip it in the
bud. The early Christians willingly placed themselves under the
leadership of the pastor and deacons because they were known to be
ordained of God and that one could profit from their guidance and
leadership.

PARENTAL AUTHORITY - CHAIN OF COMMAND

Case Study \#1

A twenty-one year-old girl returned home with an engagement ring and her
boy friend in tow. After meeting and conversing with the young man, the
parents told their daughter in private that they did not approve of her
marrying this person at this time and that she should wait for a year or
two. They stated their belief that "the marriage will not work" and that
"this fellow is not for you." The daughter argued that she felt that the
Lord had brought they two of them together and that since they were both
Christians it would be all right to marry right away.

What would be the correct answer in counseling with this young woman?
Should she:

​(1) Go ahead with her marriage plans if she thinks it is the Lord's
will for her, or

​(2) Follow her parents' wishes and wait until they give approval?

Case Study \#2

An eighteen-year-old Christian young man announced to his unsaved father
that the Lord had called him into the ministry and that he was thinking
of going to Bible school to prepare for the pastorate. The father was
strictly against such a move, and he advised his son to enter university
instead, to prepare for a vocation. He told his son that he should have
a profession to fall back on in case he should fail in the ministry. He
wanted his son to get his college degree first; then, if he still wanted
to be a pastor, he could pursue that career.

What advice should be given to the son in this case? Should he:

​(1) Follow his father's wishes and enter the university, or

​(2) Follow his own desires and go to Bible School?

Case Study \#3

A teenage girl wanted to attend a certain Bible-teaching church, but her
mother refused to allow this. So the girl began to attend secretly as
often as she could. Her mother found out and was very angry. She told
her daughter that she should be at home attending to her chores around
the house instead of spending so much time with "those kids."

Should the teenage girl:

​(1) Continue to attend Bible sessions secretly in order to get good
teaching, or

​(2) obey her mother's wishes?

The answer in all three cases above is: RESPECT THE PARENT'S WISHES! The
following section describes the reasons for this answer.

THE BIBLICAL BASIS FOR A CHILD'S ABSOLUTE SUBMISSION

The following commands from Scripture indicate the extent to which God
has committed Himself to working with children through their parents.
Notice that the spiritual condition and personality of the parent are
not listed as conditions to obedience of these commands.

Eph. 6:1-3 "The right thing for you to do is to obey your parents as
those whom the Lord has set over you. Honor your father and mother ...
that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth."

Col. 3:20, "Obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing
unto the Lord."

Prov. 20, "My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the
law of thy mother; bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them
about thy neck. When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest,
it shall keep thee; and when thou wakest, it shall talk with thee; for
the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; the reproofs of
instruction are the way of life."

THE FOCUS OF RESPONSE IS THE LORD, NOT THE PARENT

Part of God's purpose for placing parents in authority is to teach
obedience to Himself. God is able to accomplish His purposes in our
lives through those He places in authority over us, regardless of
whether they are good leaders.

The Lord has beautiful and significant plans for those who love and
respect Him (Mal. 3:16,17). We will be His jewels; we will be treated as
the sons of God. When a young person reacts against the tools of
authority that God has place in his life, he is reacting against God
Himself. Severe warnings are given in the Bible about this.

Prov. 30:17, "The eye that mocketh at his father and despises to obey
his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young
eagles shall eat it."

Heb. 12:5, "My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor
faint when thou art reproved of him: for whom the Lord loveth he
chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."

ESSENTIAL INSIGHTS IN IDENTIFYING GOD AS THE SOURCE OF AUTHORITY

In order to properly identify the hand of God in the authority which is
exercised over us, several insights are necessary.

We must learn to differentiate between position and personality. One of
the first objections to obeying authority is, "I can't respect the one
I'm supposed to obey." But it is possible to respect a person's position
of authority while at the same time being aware of character
deficiencies which need correction.

A teenager might way, "Why should I listen to my parents? They tell me
not to do certain things, but they go out and do the same things
themselves!" But this young person fails to distinguish between his
parents' position and their character. The young man would be quick to
see the error of his line of reasoning if his friend stated, "They other
day I got stopped for speeding, but the policeman has such a bad
personality that I tore up the ticket."

Some say, "My parents don't even try to understand me, so why should I
listen to them?" Here again, there is a failure to distinguish between
position and personality. It is more important that the young person
understand what God is trying to accomplish than that his parents
understand him. God knows that those He places in authority will have
character deficiencies? But He is able to work in spite of these
deficiencies.

Psalm 76:10, "Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee."

Prov. 16:7, "When a man's ways please the Lord, He maketh even his
enemies to be at peace with him."

See also 1 Peter 2:18-20.

God can develop mature attitudes through His use of authority. He can
use those who are the hardest to get along with to motivate us to
develop mature attitudes. In each of the three case studies which are
described above, the parent in authority detected an immature attitude
on the part of the young person.

In Case Study \#1, the marriage was disapproved because the parents
detected underlying attitudes in both their daughter and her fiancé
which would have made them incompatible in marriage. Each has a negative
attitude of self-will. Each expected to be the center of the stage.
Neither had learned submission to authority. They had no concept of
deference to one another or regard for the wishes of the other. Proper
attitudes could be learned by the young people, if they would follow the
advice to wait.

In Case Study \#2, the father detected in his son attitudes of
ungratefulness, stubbornness, and insensitivity to the feelings of
others. Even though he was not a believer, the father realized that
these attitudes would cause his son to fail in the ministry. The fact
that his father had some apprehension of his son's failure in the
ministry should have been a significant warning to the son that he might
be wrong.

In Case Study \#3, the teenaged girl, by responding properly to her
mother would allow her mother to see that her old attitudes had changed
as a result of attending the church, and she would be advancing the most
powerful argument for her mother to allow her to continue attending the
church.

God's concern is that our attitudes become consistent with those of His
Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus was subject to the authority of His parents as
He was growing up. Because of this response, He grew in wisdom, stature,
and in favor with God and man. He "humbled himself and became
obedient...".

DISCERNING BASIC INTENTIONS

The basic intentions of those in authority must be discerned. Daniel
"purposed that he would not defile himself with the king's meat." Yet
the authorities were not trying to make him violate his convictions;
they were genuinely concerned about his appearance before the king. So
Daniel was in the right frame of mind to help the officer in charge work
out a compromise.

In Case Study \#1, the basic intentions of the parents who disapproved
their daughter's marriage were not to restrict her happiness but rather
to help her achieve a lasting happiness. They intended to pass on to her
the insights and lessons which they had learned, sometimes the hard way.
They intended for her to avoid a lot of future complications which they
knew would occur if she made the wrong choice in marriage. They intended
to derive pleasure and joy from their daughter's happy marriage.

In Case Study \#2, the basic intention of the father for the son was not
to talk him out of the ministry but to provide him with the tools for
being successful in life. He intended to use the boy's college education
to build mature attitudes in his son. He wanted to be proud of his son's
achievements. He intended to rest in the fact that his son was building
security in his vocation. He intended that his son be grateful and
appreciative for what he had done for him. And he intended to keep a
channel of communication open so that his son would be responsive in the
future.

In Case Study \#3, the basic intentions of the teenage girl's mother
were not to stop the girl from going to church, but to develop obedience
toward her parents. This obedience involved assuming responsibilities
around the house rather than "running off all the time." The mother
observed that some of her daughter's friends were not obeying their
parents and often condemned their parents for not being "spiritual". She
did not want her daughter to develop these attitudes and practices.

Alternatives for the girl who wanted to get married:

Discuss with her parents the qualities she should look for in a husband.

Give her parents ample opportunity to become acquainted with the
boyfriend before there was any discussion of marriage.

Ask her parents to point out areas where both she and her boyfriend
could improve.

Request that her parents set up guidelines to help her discern whether
she has met the right life partner.

Be willing to show deference to her parents on the timing of the
marriage.

Alternatives for the young man who wanted to go into the ministry:

Accept the challenge of motivating new spiritual interest in his father.
This is the best preparation he could have for the ministry since this
is one of the most important functions of the ministry.

Work out with his father and his minister areas of training at the
university which would be useful in both the ministry and in another
vocation.

Develop a personal program of Bible study while at the university; and
use the university experience as an opportunity for a ministry with
students.

Alternatives for the teenage girl:

Ask forgiveness for her past attitudes and actions which were wrong.

Commit her mother to the Lord prior to her request to attend the youth
group, understanding that the Lord would be speaking through her mother.

Determine ahead of time that she would silently thank the Lord for
whatever answer her mother gave, and continue to develop right attitudes
in the home.

### THE RESULTS OF OBEDIENCE TO PARENTS

It is always right to obey God, even when that obedience interrupts or
disturbs our plans. Obedience to parents is one of the most essential
habits for young people to learn; and parents should insist on obedience
from the time their children are babies. A great deal of rebellion can
be prevented by parents using Biblical principles in training their
children. See Ex. 21:15-17; Lev. 20:9; Deut. 21:18-21; Matt. 15:3-6.

Divine discipline and other unpleasant results of rebellion are totally
avoidable. The great inner peace, the happiness, the wonderful blessings
of living the Plan of God for the life are unmistakably the greatest
experiences a person can have.

Christian in the Workplace
--------------------------

**Titus 2:9,10 “Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, and
to please them well in all things; not answering again; not stealing,
but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God
our Savior in all things.”**

These verses show in capsule form the principles which are to govern the
everyday life of a Christian who is an employee and who wants to be a
witness for Christ on the job.

A Christian operates on Grace principles. He is gracious. He gives
evidence of the fruit of the Holy Spirit. He uses Bible techniques such
as Faith-Rest, Walking in Fellowship, Occupation with Christ, to make it
through each day producing divine good.

A Christian does his job as though Christ himself were boss - “as unto
the Lord.” He does a more than a day’s work for a day’s pay. He is the
first to arrive and the last to leave. He takes sick leave only when
sick. He doesn’t cheat on break time, lunch, etc. He works diligently,
cheerfully, enthusiastically, without complaining.

Using Faith-Rest principles, a Christian trusts the Lord for salary,
promotion, status. He is aware that only God knows how much prosperity
he should have and when he should be promoted. He rejoices when others
get ahead as evidence of the grace of God in their lives (even when they
don’t deserve it.

A Christian is modest, self-effacing, sup¬portive of others,
cooperative. He realizes that he is there to be used by the Lord, not
only as an employee, but also as a witness for Christ.

The believer’s personal life, social life, family life are happy and
stable so that they enhance his work life rather than hinder him on the
job.

He exercises grace principles -- recognizes fellow workers as objects of
God’s grace, does not bear grudges, forgives readily. Every day is a new
day. He does not contribute to office gossip or politics, because he has
no need to build his success on someone else’s failure.

He waits patiently for the opportunity for verbal witness, which is
almost certain to pre¬sent itself. The stage has been set for a vital
witness by his life witness which others have been able to observe.

Circumcision
------------

One of the first acts of circumcision in the human race involved
Abraham.

Genesis 17:6-11 And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will
make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after
thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto
thee, and to thy seed after thee.

And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein
thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
possession; and I will be their God.

And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou,
and thy seed after thee in their generations.

This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy
seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a
token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

This initial act of circumcision was the seal of Abraham's faith in
God's promise of possessing the land. It was the indication that Abraham
believed God's word. Abraham separated himself unto the Lord and to the
Lord's promise.

Circumcision is, therefore, a sign of regeneration for the Jews. It was
to the born again Jew what water baptism is to the born-again believer
in the Church Age, a sign.

Circumcision is also used by God as a teaching mechanism, a visual aid
to provide a picture of regeneration by faith. The circumcision of male
children on the 8th day was an act of dedication by the parents. By this
means they declared that they would teach salvation by faith to their
children. They anticipated that their children would become believers.

Col. 2:11-13 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made
without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the
circumcision of Christ:

Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through
the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.

And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.

Circumcision is also a picture of positional truth, especially the
identification with Jesus Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection.

There can be no victory in the Christian way of life without victory
over the old life, over the sin nature. This is the application of
positional truth to experience.

The Lord also used circumcision as a picture of Israel's restoration to
fellowship and service.

READ Joshua 5:1-9

This restoration, by faith, was necessary for the victory the Israelites
were about to experience (Jericho) and for the time of rest they were
about to enter. There can be no victory over Canaan until there is
victory over carnality (Egypt). Circumcision denotes separation from the
world and the flesh, self-judgment, yieldedness, dedication, commitment.

Romans 4:9-13 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only,
or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to
Abraham for righteousness.

How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of
the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the
father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that
righteousness might be imputed unto them also.

And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision
only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father
Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.

For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to
Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness
of faith.

Circumcision is a sign of imputed righteousness; it is the sign that one
has believed and is cleansed by the blood of Christ and has God's
Righteousness credited to his account. Gen. 15:6; 2 Cor. 5:21.

The true significance of circumcision was not in the physical act being
perpetuated but in the reasons the ritual was begun in the first place.
Circumcision was a sign that something had already taken place, namely,
Abraham's salvation.

Circumcision was also a seal. A seal indicates the validity of the thing
to which it is attached. It has no significance apart from that which it
covers. Circumcision was a seal attached to something valuable,
salvation.

During the Church Age, water baptism is the outward sign of an inward
faith. Circumcision was the outward sign for the Jews before the Church
Age.

Religious Jews tried to make the seal valuable in itself. They attached
spiritual value to the act of circumcision, ignoring the substance. They
contended that circumcision was needed for salvation, which led to the
formation of a ritualistic religion.

Abraham was saved by faith, long before he was circumcised. He is,
therefore, the "father of all who believe" because he is the pattern of
those who were saved in status quo uncircumcision, whether Jew or
Gentile.

Crete
-----

**Crete** is an island which forms a southern boundary to the Aegean
Sea, and lies southeast of Greece. Crete is 156 miles long, seven to
thirty-five miles wide, and 3,189 square miles in area. It is the fifth
largest island in the Mediterranean Sea (after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus,
and Corsica), and is on the spine of an undersea mountain range thought
to have formed at one time a land bridge between the Greek Peloponnesian
peninsula and southern Turkey. In ancient times, Crete was the main
stepping stone (by sea) between Greece and Africa, and between Asia
Minor and Africa. The Philistines may have migrated to Palestine from
Greece, having been located on Crete for a time in the ancient past.

Homer attributes to this island only ninety cities, **ennhkonta
polhe**v, yet In other places he gives it the epithet of
**eJkatompoliv**, hundred cities. And this number it is generally
allowed to have had originally; but we must not let the term city
deceive us, as in ancient times places were thus named which would rate
with villages or hamlets only in these modern times.[^1]

Few places in antiquity have been more celebrated than Crete: it was not
only famous for its hundred cities, but for the arrival of Europa on a
bull, or in the ship Taurus, from Phoenicia; for the Labyrinth, the work
of Daedalus; for the destruction of the Minotaur, by Theseus; for Mount
Ida, where Jupiter was preserved 254 from the jealousy of his father
Saturn; for Jupiter’s sepulchre; and above all, for its king, Minos, and
the laws which he gave to his people; the most pure, wholesome, and
equal, of which antiquity can boast.

Their lawgiver, Minos, is said by Homer to have held a conference every
ninth year with Jupiter, from whom he is reported to have received
directions for the farther improvement of his code of laws; though this
be fable, it probably states a fact in disguise. Minos probably revised
his laws every ninth year, and, to procure due respect and obedience to
them, told the people that he received these improvements from Jupiter
himself. This was customary with ancient legislators who had to deal
with an ignorant and gross people, and has been practised from the days
of Minos to those of Mohammed.

According to ancient authors, Crete was originally peopled from
Palestine. That part of Palestine which lies on the Mediterranean was by
the Arabs called *Keritha*, and by the Syrians, *Creth*; and the Hebrews
called its inhabitants *Kerethi* or *Kerethim* which the Septuagint have
translated **krhta\~**. In Ezekiel 25:16, we find “I will cut off the
Cherethims”, translated by the Septuagint **kai exoloqreusw krhtav**, I
will destroy the Cretans; and Zephaniah 2:5: “Woe unto the inhabitants
of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites, Septuagint, “the
sojourners of the Cretans.” That these prophets do not speak of the
island of Crete is plain from their joining the Kerethim with the
Pelishtim as one and the same people. “Thus saith the Lord God, Behold I
will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and will cut off the
Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the seacoast;” Ezekiel 25:16.
“Woe unto the inhabitants of the seacoasts, the nation of the
Cherethites; the word of the Lord is against you: O Canaan, the land of
the Philistines, I will even destroy thee;” Zephaniah 2:5.

Accordingly it appears that the Kerethim were a part of the Philistines.
**The Kerethim in Palestine were noted for archery**; and we find that
some of them were employed by David as his life guards, 2 Samuel 8:18;
15:18; 20:23; 1 Kings 1:38; 1 Chronicles 18:17; in all which places they
are called, in our translation, Cherethites.

Idomeneus, who assisted Agamemnon in the Trojan war, was the last king
of Crete. He left the regency of the island to his adopted son Leucus,
who, in the absence of the king, usurped the empire; the usurper was
however soon expelled, and Crete became one of the most celebrated
republics in antiquity. The Romans at last, under Quintus Metellus,
after an immense expenditure of blood and treasure, succeeded in
subduing the island, on which he abolished the laws of Minos, and
introduced the code of Numa Pompilius.

Crete, with the small kingdom of Cyrene, became a Roman province; this
was at first governed by proconsul, next by a quaestor and assistant,
and lastly by a consul. Constantine the Great, in the new division he
made of the provinces of the empire, separated Crete from Cyrene, and
left it, with Africa and Illyria, to his third son Constans.

In the ninth century, in the reign of Michael II., it was attacked and
conquered by the Saracens. About 965, the Emperor Nicephorus Phocas, in
the following century, defeated and expelled the Saracens, and reunited
the island to the empire, after it had been under the power of the
infidels upwards of 100 years. It remained with the empire until the
time of Baldwin, earl of Flanders, who, being raised to the throne,
rewarded the services of Boniface, marquis of Montferrat, by making him
king of Thessalonica, and adding to it the island of Crete. Baldwin,
preferring a sum of gold to the government of the island, sold it to the
Venetians, A. D. 1194, under whose government it was called Candia, from
the Arabic (Arabic) Kandak, a fortification, the name which the Saracens
gave to the metropolis which they had built and strongly fortified.

In 1645, in the midst of a peace, it was attacked by the Turks with a
fleet of 400 sail, which had on board an army of 60,000 men, under the
command of four pashas, to oppose whom the whole island could only
muster 3,500 infantry, and a small number of cavalry; yet with these
they held out against a numerous and continually recruited army,
disputing every inch of ground, so that the whole Ottoman power was
employed for nearly thirty years before they got the entire dominion of
the island. In this long campaign against this brave people the Turks
lost about 200,000 men! [End of Clarke notes. wd]

Crete is centrally located, but very little was known of its history
prior to the Greek period. It was not until the archaeological
expeditions of Sir Arthur Evans in the late 19th Century that some of
the true facts of ancient Cretan history became known. Evans was an
out-of-work millionaire in England, so he took a position as the curator
of the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford University in Oxford, England. He was
an avid amateur archaeologist, but he was to achieve a reputation which
placed him among the most professional.

Evans was also a numismatist, and he heard about some very interesting
signet rings which had supposedly been left on the island of Crete by
some ancient Egyptians. Taking an extended vacation from the museum, he
sailed his personal yacht to Crete in 1894. He arrived in the harbor at
Knossos in that year, and he began an archaeological dig at a place
nearby called the Kephala site. On the very first day of digging, he
uncovered the top of a bronze age palace. He knew that he had found
something, but the property didn't belong to him; so he covered up the
hole and began negotiations with the Greek government on Crete to
purchase the site.

The place that Evans bought was the site of ancient Knossos; and the
palace he had found was that of King Minos, who had, up until that time,
been thought of only as a legend. Evans called the civilization of King
Minos the Minoan civilization. This civilization flourished from early
times up until about 1400 B.C., and its discovery has been invaluable to
the study of Greek and European history and languages, especially those
of the eastern Mediterranean area.

The Minoan culture is distinguished by the originality and high
development of its art and architecture. In fact, the Minoan culture is
considered to be a forerunner of the Mycenaean civilization of ancient
Greece.

Many examples of pictographic script were found at the palace site; and
two basic forms were identified, labeled Minoan Linear A and Linear B.
The work of decipherment began in the 1930's, but it was not until 1953
that the Linear B script puzzle was solved, by two men named Ventris and
Chadwick. They determined that Linear B is an archaic form of early
Greek. Linear A is still under examination.

Sir Arthur Evans was recognized with many honors: he was elected a
Fellow of the Royal Society of Archaeologists; he was knighted in 1911;
he was named president of the Society of Antiquaries from 1914 to 1919.
He died at Oxford in 1941.

The Minoan civilization was destroyed in about 1400 B.C. with the
eruption of the Santorini volcano at the island of Thera, about 70 miles
north of Crete. It is thought that first a huge tidal wave struck the
island, destroying coastal cities and populations, and that then
volcanic ash came down, burying the whole island. Arthur Evans uncovered
the buildings 3300 years later.

Of course, the island began to be repopulated immediately as people
migrated from the mainland. In about 600 B.C., Dorian Greeks came in
force and settled the island by conquest. Their cousins were the Spartan
Greeks from the Peloponnesus and the Philistine Greeks of Palestine.
Spartan Greeks settled on the western side of the island in cities like
Lyttus. All of the Greeks on the island were warlike, fierce fighters
who prided themselves on their independence and warrior qualities.
Island people have a tendency to be independent, and this trait was
augmented by their heredity.

There were Cretan Jews at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost, Acts 2:11;
and Paul stopped at least once at Crete, on his voyage to Rome, Acts
27:7ff.

The following excerpts are from the works of Polybius, one of the most
famous and prolific Greek historians of Roman times. The quotations are
taken from his Histories, Volumes II, III, and VI. The citations
indicate volume and page numbers as [II, 319], etc.

On the Cretan military [II, 319ff] - "The Cretans both by land and sea
are irresistible in ambuscades, forays, tricks played on the enemy,
night attacks, and all petty operations which require fraud; but they
are cowardly and down-hearted in the massed face-to-face charge of an
open battle".

On Crete's internal strife and civil wars [II, 429ff], "The city of
Lyttus met with an irremediable disaster. Knossians and Gortynians had
subjected the whole island, except for Lyttus (about 225 B.C.). Since
Lyttus would not surrender to them, they declared war against it. At
first, all the Cretans took part in the war against the Lyttans; but
jealousy sprang up from some trifling cause, as is common with the
Cretans. Several cities went over to the aid of Lyttus.

"Meanwhile, the city of Gortyn was having civil war, in which the elder
citizens were taking the side of Knossos and the younger were siding
with Lyttus. The elder Gortynians, with the help of Knossians and
Aetolians, whom they had secretly let into the city and the citadel, put
to death the younger citizens, delivering the city of Gortyn to Knossos.

"At about the same time, the Lyttians left with their whole force for an
expedition into enemy territory. But the Knossians got word of their
departure and used the opportunity to occupy Lyttus, destroying the town
and sending the populace into slavery. The Lyttus military returned to a
gutted city and were so distraught that they didn't even enter the town,
but sought refuge in the city of Lappa, becoming in one day cityless
aliens instead of citizens.

"Thus, Lyttus, a colony of the Spartans, and allied to them by blood,
the most ancient city in Crete, and the breeding place of her bravest
men, was utterly and unexpectedly made away with."

On the greed of Cretans [III,373ff] (In a comparison of the Spartan and
Cretan constitutions) -- "In all these respects the Cretan practice is
exactly the opposite (to the Spartan). Their laws go as far as possible
in letting them acquire land to the extent of their power; and money is
held in such high honor among them that its acquisition is not only
regarded as necessary, but as most honorable.

"So much, in fact, do sordid love of gain and lust for wealth prevail
among them, that the Cretans are the only people in the world in whose
eyes no gain is disgraceful...owing to their ingrained lust of wealth
are involved in constant broils public and private, and in murders and
civil wars."

On Cretan treachery and conniving (this is Polybius' rebuttal to the
statements of Ephorus, Xenophon, Plato and Callisthenes that the
constitutions of Sparta and Crete are similar) [III, 375ff] -- "Such are
the points in which I consider these two political systems to differ,
and I will now give my reasons for not regarding that of Crete as worthy
of praise or imitation.

"In my opinion, there are two fundamental things in every state, by
virtue of which its principles and constitution are either desirable or
the reverse. I mean customs and laws. What is desirable in these makes
men's private lives righteous and well-ordered and the general character
of the state gentle and just. What is to be avoided has the opposite
effect.

"So, just as when we observe the laws and customs of a people to be
good, we have no hesitation in pronouncing that the citizens and the
state will consequently be good also. Thus, when we notice that men are
covetous in their private lives and that their public actions are
unjust, we are plainly justified in saying that their laws, their
particular customs, and the state as a whole, are bad.

Now it would be impossible to find, except in some rare instances,
personal conduct more treacherous, or a public policy more unjust, than
in Crete. Holding then the Cretan constitution to be neither similar to
that of Sparta nor in any way deserving of praise and imitation, I
dismiss it from the comparison which I have proposed to make."

On the treachery of some citizens of the cities of Cydonia and Apollonia
[VI, 31] -- "The people of Cydonia at this time committed a shocking act
of treachery universally condemned. For although many such things have
happened in Crete, what was done then was thought to surpass all other
instances of their habitual ferocity.

"For while they were not only friends with the Appolonians, but united
with them in general in all the rights observed by men, there being a
sworn treaty to this effect deposited in the temple of Zeus, they
treacherously seized on the city, killing the men, laying violent hands
on all property, and dividing among themselves and keeping the women and
children, and the city with its territory."

From Crete vs. Rhodes [VI, 285] -- "Antiphatas ... for, as a fact, this
young man was not at all Cretan in character but had escaped the
contagion of Cretan ill-breeding."

**The Story of the Capture of Achaeus**

(a true, and truly Cretan, episode)

First, some background Greek history -

Philip of Macedon had won recognition as a Greek by force of arms. He
announced his intention of leading a united Greek army against Persia to
overthrow it once and for all. He was elected general at the city of
Corinth in 335 B.C., but he was murdered shortly thereafter, and the
army and generalship passed to his son, Alexander.

Alexander crossed the Hellespont in 334 B.C. with an army of 35,000
Macedonians and Greeks. He visited Troy, dedicated his armor to Athena,
and placed a crown on the tomb of Achilles, whom he regarded as his
ancestor. His first engagement with the Persians was at the river
Granicus, east of Troy, which opened his way into Asia Minor. The second
main battle was at Issus, after which he overran the whole east coast of
the Mediterranean, conquering as far as Egypt. His third great battle
was at Guagamela in 331 B.C., which brought the final downfall of the
Persian empire. He went on to conquer territory over into India, but
died at the age of 32 of a fever probably made worse by alcoholism.

Alexander had begun to think of world empire, but it was not to be. His
generals fought each other to be his successor; and they finally divided
the conquered territories among themselves. Ptolemy began his dynasty in
Egypt, which lasted until Cleopatra. The Seleucid dynasty in Asia Minor,
with the kings named Seleucus or Antiochus, lasted until 65 B.C. when
Syria became a Roman province. The Antigonid rulers of mainland Greece
and Macedonia also remained independent until the Roman takeover.

For the next century and a half after Alexander, the history of Asia
Minor is that of the attempts by various kings to extend their dominion
over the Mediterranean area. There was continuous fighting between
Greeks, Egyptians, and Syrians, as first one and then the other became
ambitious for more territory.

In about 215 B.C., Antiochus III took an army to hunt down a man named
Achaeus, a member of the Syrian royal family, who had proclaimed himself
king in Asia Minor. Achaeus and his army were forced to retreat into the
city of Sardis, and Antiochus troops were camped almost all the way
around the city in siege.

Now - at this time, Bolis, a Cretan, was a high ranking official in the
court of Ptolemy, the Egyptian king. He was possessed of superior
intelligence, exceptional courage, and much military experience. He was
approached by Sosibius, the Egyptian "secretary of state", and asked to
work up a plan to save Achaeus from the clutches of Antiochus. In about
three days, Bolis told Sosibius that he would take on the job; mainly
because he had spent some time in Sardis and knew the layout of the land
and the city. And he knew that Cambylus, another Cretan, and a friend of
his, was the commander of the Cretan mercenaries in Antiochus' army.

In fact, Cambylus and his force of Cretans had charge of one of the
outposts behind the citadel where Antiochus was not able to build siege
works. This portion of the surrounding forces' line was occupied by
Cambylus's troops.

Sosibius had almost given up the idea of rescuing Achaeus; but now he
thought that if anyone could do it, Bolis could. And Bolis was so
enthusiastic about the idea that the project really began to move.
Sosibius advanced the funds necessary for the project; and he promised
Bolis a large reward from Ptolemy himself, pointing out also that King
Achaeus would probably express his gratitude with money.

Bolis set sail without delay carrying dispatches in code and credentials
to Nicomachus in Rhodes, a close friend of Achaeus, and to Melancomas at
Ephesus. These two men had previously acted as Achaeus' trusted agents
in foreign affairs. They were in agreement with Bolis' plan and began to
make arrangements to help him in the rescue attempt. Bolis also sent
word to Cambylus at Sardis that he had a matter of great urgency to
discuss with him in private.

Bolis, being a Cretan and naturally astute, had been weighing every idea
and testing the soundness of every plan. When Bolis met with Cambylus,
(according to Polybius), "They discussed the matter from a thoroughly
Cretan point of view. For they did not take into consideration either
the rescue of the man in danger or their loyalty to those who had
charged them with the task, but only their personal security and
advantage. Both of them, then, Cretans as they were, soon arrived at the
same decision, which was to divide between them in equal shares the ten
talents advanced by Sosibius and then to reveal the project to
Antiochus; and undertake, if assisted by him, to deliver Achaeus into
his hands on receiving a sum of money in advance and the promise of a
reward upon delivery of Achaeus adequate in importance to the
enterprise."

So, Cambylus left to talk to Antiochus; and Bolis sent a messenger to
Achaeus with coded messages from Nicomachus and Melancomas outlining the
plan to the king. Should Achaeus agree to make the attempt at escape,
Bolis would go ahead with the rescue plan. Antiochus, for his part, was
surprised and delighted at the offer from Cambylus. He was ready to
promise anything to get Achaeus in his hands; but he was equally wary of
any Cretan plan. So he demanded a detailed account of their project and
how they were going to carry it out. Cambylus was able to convince him,
so Antiochus urged him to put it into execution, and he advanced several
talents for expenses.

Bolis, meanwhile, communicated with Nicomachus and Melancomas, who,
believing that the attempt was being made in all good faith, immediately
drew up letters to Achaeus in a secret mercantile code so that only
Achaeus could read the messages. The letters urged Achaeus to put his
trust in Bolis and Cambylus.

Bolis' messenger gained access to the citadel in Sardis with the aid of
Cambylus, and he handed the letters to Achaeus. The messenger had been
completely briefed in the fake plan, and he was able to give an accurate
and detailed account of everything in answer to Achaeus' numerous
questions about Bolis and Sosibius, Nicomachus and Melancomas, and
especially Cambylus. The messenger was able to support the
cross-questioning with confidence and honesty because he had no
knowledge of the real agreement between Bolis and Cambylus.

Achaeus was convinced and agreed to the plan. He sent word back to
Rhodes to Nicomachus, to tell Bolis to proceed. Achaeus figured that
once he had escaped he could travel quickly back to Syria, while
Antiochus was still occupied in the siege of Sardis, and create a great
movement in his favor.

The rescue plan was as follows --Bolis and the messenger would go into
the citadel and lead Achaeus out. The messenger would lead the way out
because he knew the path and there was a new moon, making it completely
dark. Bolis would be last and stick close to Achaeus. If Achaeus were to
be alone, there would be no problem. But they wanted to take him alive;
and if he brought some people with him, they didn't want to take any
chances of his escaping in the dark when he found out he was being
kidnapped.

Cambylus took Bolis to talk personally with Antiochus, who again
promised a huge reward for Achaeus. That night, about two hours before
daybreak, Bolis went through the lines to the citadel and met Achaeus.
Here, let Polybius pick up the narrative --

"As, however, Achaeus was second to none in intelligence, and had had
considerable experience, he judged it best not to repose entire
confidence in Bolis. He announced that he would first send out three or
four of his friends, and after they had made sure that everything was
all right, he would himself get ready to leave. Achaeus was indeed doing
his best; but he did not consider that, as the saying goes, he was
trying to play the Cretan with a Cretan. For there was no probable
precaution of this kind that Bolis had not minutely examined."

Achaeus dressed himself in rude clothing and put fairly good clothing on
some of his retainers. Then, in darkness, they went out on the steep and
difficult trail down from the citadel, the messenger in front as
planned, with Bolis bringing up the rear. Again, Polybius:

"Bolis found himself perplexed ... for although a Cretan and ready to
entertain every kind of suspicion regarding others, he could not owing
to the darkness make out which was Achaeus, or even if he were present.
But he noticed that at certain slippery and dangerous places on the
trail some of the men would take hold of Achaeus and give him a hand
down, as they were unable to put aside their customary respect for him.
So Bolis very soon determined who was Achaeus."

Achaeus was taken in ambush by Bolis and his men, who kept Achaeus's
hands inside his garment to prevent suicide. He was taken bound hand and
foot to Antiochus, who summarily executed him. Bolis and Cambylus
received their rewards and went their way.

A final word from Polybius: "Thus did Achaeus perish, after taking every
reasonable precaution and defeated only by the perfidy of those whom he
had trusted, leaving two useful lessons to posterity, firstly to trust
no one too easily, and secondly not to be boastful in the season of
prosperity, but, being men, to be prepared for any turn of fortune."

Essence of God
--------------

Essence of God

The phrase "Essence of God" is a theological term used to refer to God's
personal characteristics, or to the facets of His personality. Sometimes
the term "Attributes of God" is used to refer to God's essence. The
"attributes", or the "essence", of God are His primary characteristics,
so they cannot be completely communicated to man. They can be described
to a degree, but they cannot be fully defined.

Finite man cannot define the infinite. The Bible is the Word of God, and
as such it reveals those facts about the Creator that He has seen fit to
reveal about Himself.

Man suppose that God thinks like a man. We think God wants revenge,
because when we're insulted, we want revenge. When we are cheated, we
want immediate justice and retribution. We are indignant and shocked at
the behavior of others, so we expect God to be shocked.

But God does not feel insulted. He does not feel cheated - He owns
everything. He is not indignant, temperamental, or emotional. He does
not throw tantrums (or lightning bolt\~). He is not surprised or shocked
by anything. He is never depressed or moody.

God is not arrogant or egotistical. He knows Himself, is self-assured,
and is humble.

God is a rational, logical, stable-minded, patient; and all of His
thinking is backed up by His omniscience. And He approaches every issue
from the basis of His perfect character, the subject of this study.

God approaches every issue regarding human beings out of His love for
all men. His thinking toward man takes all of His attributes into
consideration - but Love is always present. It is God's thinking about
us, in love, that is His perfect Grace thinking. He is always gracious,
always thinks Grace.

Spirituality is one of God's primary attributes. God is immaterial, in a
universe that is made up of both material and immaterial. God has
revealed something of what He is in the Word, but only He knows Himself
fully. We must rely on what is written in the Bible for any
understanding of what God is like.

The fact that God is a spiritual being means that He lives. Spirituality
implies life. Jer. 10:10 and 1 Th. 1:9 tell us that God is alive and
well. The life of God has no beginning and no ending. God is eternal.
The Christian shares God's eternal life, but since his eternal life has
a beginning at the time he accepted Jesus Christ as Savior, his eternal
life is properly called "everlasting life".

All of the characteristics of the divine essence are present in God at
all times, but not all are manifest at the same time, just as while all
colors are present in a ray of white light, the individual colors can be
seen only under certain conditions of reflection or refraction. Various
attributes of God can be seen in certain situations. For example:

In salvation, God's love and eternal life are apparent.

In judgment, His righteousness and justice are manifested.

In God's faithfulness, His immutability and veracity are shown.

In God's Plan, His omniscience and sovereignty are seen.

In God's will, sovereignty is paramount.

In God's revelation, veracity, love, and omniscience are obvious.

The rest of this paper is devoted to a description of the ten
characteristics of the Essence of God as seen in the various Bible
passages that describe them.

Sovereignty

GOD IS THE SUPREME BEING OF THE UNIVERSE.

Deut. 4:39 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that
the Lord, he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath; there
is none else.

I Sam. 2:6-8 The Lord killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to
Sheol, and bringeth up. The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich; he
bringeth low, and lifteth up. He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
and lifteth up the beggar from the refuse, to set them among princes,
and to make them inherit the throne of glory; for the pillars of the
earth are the Lord's, and he hath set the world upon them.

I Chron. 29:11 Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the
glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heaven
and in the earth is thine. This is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art
exalted as head above all.

II Chron. 20:6 And said, O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in
heaven? And rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the nations? And in
thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to
withstand thee?

Psalm 83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is the Lord,
are the Most High over all the earth.

Isaiah 45:5,6 I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God
beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me. That they may
know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none
beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else.

Acts 17:24 God, who made the world and all things in it, seeing that he
is the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
hands.

God has a will. He is eternal, infinite, and self-determining. He makes
decisions, policies, sets up principles. This is divine volition.

Daniel 4:35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing;
and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the
inhabitants of the earth, and none can stay his hand, or say unto him,
What doest thou?

Heb. 6:13 For when God made a promise to Abraham, because he could swear
by no greater, he swore by himself.

Psalm 47:7 For God is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises with
understanding.

Psa 115:3 But our God is in the heavens; he hath done whatsoever he
pleased.

In His sovereignty, God decided to give man a free will. The meeting
place of Man's will and God's will is the Cross. (John 3:16)

God's sovereign plan for the human race is first, salvation, "Believe on
the Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts 16:31); second, during life on earth as a
believer, to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to grow in Christ (Eph
5:18; I Peter 3:18); and third, to have eternal life in heaven, in a
resurrection body.

Righteousness

God is absolutely holy, or righteous.

Psalm 145:17 The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
works.

Lev. 19:2b Ye shall be holy; for I, the Lord your God, am holy.

I Sam. 2:2 There is none holy like the Lord; for there is none beside
thee, neither is there any rock like our God.

Psalm 22:3 But thou art holy, O thou who inhabitest the praises of
Israel.

Ps. 111:9 He sent redemption unto his people; he hath commanded his
covenant forever; holy and reverend is his name.

Isaiah 6:3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is
the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.

God is good.

Ps. 25:8 Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will he teach sinners
in the way.

Ps. 34:8 Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who
trusteth in him.

Ps. 86:5 For thou, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous
in mercy unto all those who call upon thee.

God is free from sin.

II Cor. 5:21 For he hath made him, who knew no sin, to be sin for us,
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

I John 1:5 This, then, is the message which we have heard of him, and
declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

God is perfect in His character and Person.

Deut. 32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are
justice; a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.

Ps. 7:9 Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but
establish the just; for the righteous God tests the minds and hearts.

Rom. 1:17 For in it is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
faith; as it is written The just shall live by faith.

Psalms 11:7; 97:6; 111:3; 119:137

Jer. 23:6

John 17:25

Rom. 10:3

I John 2:29.

God is righteous in all His attitudes and actions

Deut. 32:4

2 Sam. 22:31

Ps. 119:137; 145:17

Dan. 9:14

Rev. 19:2

In the application of the concept of God's righteousness (+R) to the
unbeliever, it is important to remember that His righteousness is
absolute. This means that He cannot fellowship with sin. He must demand
the same perfection of His creatures. Man's concept of righteousness is
relative (Isa. 64:6); but no one can measure up to the divine standard
nor achieve absolute righteousness by self-effort. However, the
righteousness of God is freely available to all who believe. Psalm 14:3;
Rom. 3:23; Tit. 3:5; Rom. 3:22

Justice

God is Just, and cannot be unfair. His justice demands that disobedience
against His laws be punished. Justice administers the penalty that
righteousness demands.

Psalm 19:9 ...the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous
altogether.

Psalm 50:6 ...for God is judge himself.

Psalm 58:11 ...verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

Rom. 3:26 To declare at this time his righteousness: that he might be
just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

Heb. 10:30,31 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongs unto me,
I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his
people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

HEB. 12:23

1 JOHN 1:9

REV. 15:3

God's justice is satisfied because of His grace provision of redemption.
The Lord Jesus Christ, through his substitutionary, effective death on
the Cross, transferred the guilt of the sinner onto Himself, thus
satisfying the justice of God. God is now free to pardon the sinner and
justify the one who accepts His saving grace. God is equally free to
justly condemn all who reject salvation. The basis of their indictment
is works, never sins.

1 Pet. 2:24

Rom. 5:12; 6:23; 3:21-28; 4:5; 8:1

John 3:18,36; 5:28-30.

Grace always precedes judgment.

Love

God is eternal and unchangeable love.

Jer. 31:3 The Lord has appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have
loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have
I drawn thee.

God, in His sovereignty, decided to treat man in grace. It is His love
that motivates His grace. Righteousness and Justice stood in the way
because of the sin barrier between man and God. In Love, God the Father
sent His Son to the cross to die for the sins of the whole world.
Righteousness and Justice are thus satisfied, the barrier is removed,
and love and grace can be given to men.

Eph. 2:8,9

Isa. 59:2

John 3:16.

Eternal Life

God is absolute existence.

Ex. 3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

John 8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before
Abraham was, I am.

God has neither beginning nor end.

God existed in eternity past, and He will exist forever.

Gen. 1:1 In the beginning, God...

Isa. 43:13 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

Col. 1:17 And He is before all things, and by him all things consist.

that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting
life.

John 10:28,29 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never
perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father,
which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck
them out of my Father's hand.

1 John 5:11

John 8:51: 14:1-3

The unbeliever will experience everlasting punishment.

Matt 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
righteous into life eternal.

Omniscience

God is all-knowledge.

1 Sam. 2:3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions
are weighed.

Job 26:6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

Job 34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
goings.

Psalm 139:1-12

Psalm 147:4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by
their names.

my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.

shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of
your head are all numbered.

Heb. 4:13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with
whom we have to do.

Job 37:16; 42:2

Eze. 11:5

God is infinite in wisdom and understanding.

1 Sam. 16:7 ...for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on
the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.

the heart.

Prov. 3:19 The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding
hath he established the heavens.

Jer. 17:10 I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
doings.

Jer. 51:15 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his
understanding.

Matt. 6:8 ...for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before
ye ask him.

Application to believers:

shall come forth as gold.

Matt. 6:31-33 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or,
What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all
these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoewth
that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of
God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.

James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

James 3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good
fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

2 Tim. 2:15

The Trinity

There are three distinct Persons of the Godhead, each possessing the
entire essence of deity. The three Persons comprise what the Scripture
represents as the ONE TRUE GOD. In the unity of the Godhead (Acts 17:29;
Rom. 1:20; Col. 2:9) there are three Persons on one substance, power and
eternity (Isa. 48:16; Luke 3:22; John 14:16; Rom. 15:30; 1 Cor. 12:4-6;
1 John 4:13,14)

The full title of God is "God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy
Spirit". (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). Each Person is made up of the same
divine characteristics, making each equal to either of the other two
(John 10:30; 16:15) Therefore, when the Bible speaks of God as being
One, it is a reference to Essence; when speaking of the members of the
Godhead, it is a reference to the Persons.

Faith-Rest
----------

Introduction

One of the consistent features of the Christian life is testing. We live
in a fallen world, in an imperfect society, among people whose way of
life is directed by Satan and their own sin natures. We cannot avoid the
friction, conflict, or confrontation that results from this. We face
daily disasters, small and great, which are brought on us suddenly by
nature, by the ignorance or deliberate actions of other people, or even
by our own mistakes and sins.

Faith-Rest is God's plan for Christians who are going through testing,
who are having problems. Faith-Rest is the means by which Christians can
have JOY, a happiness in this life which does not depend on people,
circumstances, or things. Think of it! God promises that you can have
the peace and joy of God, in spite of what's happening in your life, in
spite of the problems and testing that you are going through.

Your testing may be mild or severe, or anything in between. There are
family troubles, money problems, social conflicts, problems on the
job...the list is endless. The charge of the elephant, or the charge of
the mosquito, will come at any time, and usually without warning.

But you can always depend upon God's immediate and constant provision
for you in your time of testing. He knows all about our tests before
they occur and has made provisions in advance to meet our needs. (Eph.
1:3,4)

1 Cor. 10:13, "These has no testing taken you but such as is common to
man; but God will, with the testing, also make a way of escape, that you
may be able to bear it.

Hebrews 4 tells us that the wilderness generation didn't find rest
because they didn't trust God to keep His promises. There's no reason we
(believers of the church age) have to make the same mistake."

Whether the test is small or great, it is allowed by God to measure our
faith and our application of the things He has provided for us in this
life.

1 Peter 1:7 "That the trial of your faith, being much more precious that
of gold that perishes, though it be tried by fire, might be found unto
praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ."

1 Peter 5:6,7 "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of
God, that he may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon him;
for he cares for you."

Definition of Faith-Rest

Faith-Rest: the process of understanding, believing, and applying the
doctrines and promises of God's Word in times of testing in the
Christian life.

The term "faith-rest", and its definition above, is taken from the
Scriptures in Hebrews 4:1,2 "Let us therefore fear lest, a promise being
left us of entering into His rest, any of you should seem to come short
of it. For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them, but
the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in
them that heard it."

(Read Hebrews 3 and 4 before continuing with this study.)

Faith-Rest is designed to be used by the Christian throughout his
lifetime, on a daily basis, as a technique for maintaining peace and
spiritual balance during difficulties, problems, or disasters in life.
Faith-Rest is one of the Christian's most important resources in making
rapid progress toward Christian maturity and the production of divine
good in the life.

There are two reasons why Christians fail to grow and prosper in the
Christian life, and fail to profit from all the blessings, promises, and
logistical provisions which God has put in place.

The most common reason for failure to "enter into rest" is a lack of
knowledge of God's plan and the assets He has provided for us.
Christians who don't know what the Word of God says will never know the
promises of God or the provisions He has made for testing.

The other reason for failure is seen in the Chidren of Israel of the
wilderness generation. They heard the teaching but did not mix it with
faith, so they did not enter into rest (the promised land).

Examples of Faith-Rest (or lack thereof)

In this section, there are several examples from the Bible in which the
people of God had ample information on which to base their faith in God.
Sometimes the people trusted God and prospered. Sometimes the people
showed a complete lack of trust in God and fell apart when the tests
came.

You will see in these Bible passages that the extent of a believer's
spiritual maturity becomes obvious in hard times. It's easy to maintain
a facade when things are going well, when there's plenty of money, good
health, and little to worry about. All Christians look and behave about
the same in good times. But when testing comes, those who have actually
failed to grow in Christ come apart at the seams, and fall back into
patterns of worry, blaming other people, and trying to solve their own
problems by worldly means.

The examples discussed here are:

Abraham, who first distrusted, then believed God, Genesis 15

The Bitter Water Test at Marah, Exodus 15

The No-Food Test and the First No-Water Test at Meribah, Exodus 16,17

The "Giant" Test, Numbers 13 and 14

The Second No-Water Test, Numbers 20

The Example of Abraham - Genesis 14 and 15

Genesis 14 has the account of Abraham's great victory. After a victory
there is a tendency to let down, to be vulnerable, both in the physical
and spiritual realms. A football team coming off a win is harder to
motivate for the next game. A victorious army tends to become complacent
and underestimate the enemy. It is well to remember that Satan keeps
charging; and he is especially skilled at counterpunching, at exploiting
any temporary weakness. And worry is one of Satan's chief weapons.

1 Peter 5:8,9 "Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil,
like a roaring lion walks about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist
steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are
accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."

Gen. 15:1 "After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a
vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceedingly
great reward.'

Here is God's promise of protection and an outpouring of grace
blessings. The Lord has solutions for Abraham based on grace provisions
which God had laid up for him from eternity past. That is, God's plan
for Abraham is already set up and operational. It is merely a matter of
Abraham's remembering God's previous promises and believing them.

God says "Do not worry; do not be frightened." There is only one logical
thing for Abraham to do when the Lord is his shield, strength, and
reward - RELAX!

Deut. 31:6-8 "Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
them [the giants in Canaan]; for the Lord your God, he it is who goes
with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you. And Moses called to
Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, 'Be strong and of
good courage; for you must go with this people unto the land which the
Lord has sworn unto their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them
to inherit it. And the Lord, he it is who goes before you; he will be
with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you; fear not, neither
be dismayed."

Isa. 41:10-13 "Fear not, for I am with you. Be not dismayed, for I am
your God. I will strengthen you; yea, I will help you; yea, I will
uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness. Behold, all they
that were angered against you shall be ashamed and confounded, they
shall be as nothing, and they that strive with you shall perish. You
shall seek them, and shall not find them, even them that contended with
you; they that war against you shall be as nothing, and as a thing of
nought.'"

Who is the one making these promises? It is the Almighty God, the
Creator of the Universe! And every promise of God is backed up by His
perfect character and His perfect character. Our thinking about His
promises can be related to His divine attributes, for example:

Sovereignty: God in His designed Faith/Rest as part of His plan for us.

Righteousness: God is perfect goodness, so any trial will be good for
us.

Justice: Guarantees that His plan for us is fair, that we will always be
treated justly.

Love: we know that every situation in life is governed by God's love for
us.

Eternal Life: God is eternal and we have everlasting life with Him
through Christ's work on the Cross. God always plans with eternity in
view.

Omniscience: God knows about my trials or sufferings even before they
happen; and He has already planned what to do about them.

Omnipresence: God is always present and available to help.

Omnipotence: God is all-powerful so He always has the capability to
carry out his promises and to provide help in time of need.

Immutability: God never changes in His attitude toward us, and all of
His characteristics remain the same, forever.

Truth: God never lies; therefore what He has promised, He will perform
(see Romans 4).

Abraham has had great victory, then he fails. He has started to worry,
to cave in. He still feels he has something to complain about. He has no
male heir, and if there is no male heir, the inheritance will go to
Eliezer.

Gen. 15:2 "And Abram said, 'Lord God, what will you give me, seeing I go
childless, and the heir of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?'"

Worry can be a sin, Rom. 14:23, "...whatsoever is not of faith is sin."
Worry is, in fact, often equivalent to blasphemy. Worry slanders God by
saying that His promises are lies or that God is not able to keep His
promises. In other words, the fearful person believes that God can not
or will not keep His promises.

Worry is the opposite of Faith-Rest. And Faith-Rest is the answer to
worry.

Abraham has two choices: (1) he can try to solve his own problems by
worrying, fretting, planning, being upset and angry, trying to scrounge
up answers, trying to work around things, etc., or (2) he can let God
solve the problems he cannot handle.

Gen. 15:3 "And Abram said, 'Behold, you have given me no seed: and, lo,
one born in my house is my heir.'"

Abraham blames God for his troubles. Blaming others, especially blaming
God, is a sure sign of spiritual deterioration. A mature person takes
responsibility for his own actions. It is a trend in modern psychology
to find someone or something to blame for troubles, such as parents, the
environment, the community, politicians, employers, etc. But this
tendency ignores every divine provision, every blessing, every law, and
every principle of suffering.

Gen. 15:4-6 "And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying,
'This shall not be your heir, but he that shall come forth out of your
own loins shall be your heir.' And he brought him forth abroad, and
said, 'Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if you can number
them.' And he said to him, 'So shall your seed be.' And he believed in
the Lord; and He counted it to him for righteousness."

Here God restates His promises (of the Abrahamic Covenant) and gives
Abraham a dramatic illustration of what He means, by showing him the
stars. Finally, Abraham believes God. He has about 15 more years to wait
before Isaac is born, but he is able to wait patiently and have inner
peace because he has laid his burden on the Lord.

The Bitter Water Test - Exodus 15

Have you ever had a wonderful Sunday attending church, worshipping the
Lord, enjoying the fellowship of believers, everything that make you
glad to be a Christian, only to see your whole attitude change at work
on Monday as your job seems to throw you into another world?

Read Exodus 14 and 15 of the account of the Israelites escaping from
Egypt. They saw God 24 hours a day in the cloud and in the fire. In
their terror of the Egyptians they prayed frantically to God to save
them, and saw the Red Sea open up, crossed on dry land, and watched the
Egyptian army being destroyed as the waters closed back over them.

And what a victory celebration they had. Read the great song of victory
they sang. "The Lord is my strength and my song...The Lord is a man of
war...Thy right hand, O Lord, has dashed in pieces the enemy...Who is
like thee, O Lord, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing
wonders..." And on and on.

But ... just three days laters, on the march, they came to the Bitter
Sea, Marah, and ...

Exo. 15:24,25 "And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall
we drink? And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord showed him a tree,
which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet:
there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He tested
them."

As a nation, the Israelites were spiritually immature. They had no
spiritual stamina and no real understanding of who the Lord is or what
He could do. This is the first of many tests they would fail, tests
designed to demonstrate to them how helpless they were without God. As
you know, throughout their 40 years wandering in the wilderness, and in
spite of daily teaching from Moses, Aaron, and Levites, in spite of
witnessing miracle after spectacular miracle, only a small percentage of
these people ever learned to rely completely on the Lord.

The No-Food Test and First No-Water Test - Exodus 16,17

Exodus 16 gives details of the No Food test, also failed by the
Israelites, in which they murmured again against Moses, Aaron, and God.
In this case God provided manna for them. This chapter is a litany of
whining, complaining, and miserable behavior. And chapter 17 continues
the story.

There was no water at Rephidim, and the people blamed Moses for bringing
them out of Egypt so that their children and cattle could die of thirst.
Their complaining was so vehement that Moses named the place Meribah
("chiding").

Of course, the Lord provided water from the rock, at the same time
giving a beautiful picture of the gospel. Remember that God's grace
depends on His character, not on our character or faithfulness. The
people received what they did not deserve.

The Giants Test - Numbers 13,14

Numbers 13 describes a reconnaissance patrol which was led by a high
ranking officer from each of the 12 tribes. Moses would not commit a
force of 2,000,000 people into a land without sending out a patrol. The
patrol would spend 40 days in enemy territory before returning to
Kadesh-Barnea.

Num. 13:1,2. The people received directions from the Lord. Note the
promise, "...the land which I give unto the children of Israel..." The
Israelites were not being asked to move into the land on "blind faith".
There is no such thing as blind faith. Faith is the best eyesight in the
world when it is based on the promises of God. Faith is the ability to
rest on God's omniscience.

Num. 13:3-16. Caleb and Joshua are recognized as two of the great men of
history, men who know the wisdom and grace of God and are willing to
commit themselves to it. To them, the Word of God was more real that any
situation they were to face. They were fully adjusted to their
circumstances, whether good or adverse.

Num. 13:17-20. Detailed instructions for the reconnaissance. "Be ye of
good courage..." One thing necessary for a successful mission, the right
mental attitude. The difference between courage and fearfulness is being
emphasized here. And the difference is Faith-Rest! Caleb and Joshua
believed the promises of God, the other ten did not. Caleb and Joshua
had courage, the other ten did not.

When the spies returned, the camp was divided into two groups, a small
group of confident, courageous people who believed God, and a large
group of fearful people who were shaking in their boots. There were
giants in the land, and the majority were afraid of them, in spite of
the promises of God.

The Lord is greater than any giant in a Christian's life. "Greater is he
that is in you than he that is in the world." The Lord knew in advance
that there would be giants in Canaan, and He had prepared everything
ahead of time for them to occupy the land. Yet, in spite of having met
(and failed) test after test, and having seen God perform many wonderful
miracles, they still lacked courage.

Num. 13:21-27. This is a complete confirmation of what the Lord said
would be the case in the land. And His promises had been repeated time
after time. Exo. 3:8,17; 13:5; 33:3.

"Milk and honey" is an idiom for a prosperous land. The only believers
who enjoy the provision of God are those who see and appropriate God's
provisions by faith. We do not live by sight. We have provisions for
today, food, clothing, shelter. But what God provides for the soul
cannot be seen, except by faith. But the eyes of Faith-Rest are greater
than natural eyes.

Num. 13:28-33. There is no doubt that they are up against a formidable
enemy. The Hittites were one of the greatest nations in the ancient
world; they discovered iron and were the first to use iron weapons. The
Jebusites were very powerful warriors who had not been conquered for
several hundred years; their central fortification was a city called
Jerusalem. The Amalekites were craft idol and demon worshippers and
child sacrificers.

Caleb had seen God handle all of their problems time after time, but he
was not able to persuade the rest of the people. They were afraid of the
giants.

Num. 14:16. This verse explains the whole thing. The Lord could not
bring them into the land because (1) their attitude toward God was bad;
(2) their attitudes toward people was bad (mental attitude sin\~); and
(3) they were negative toward God and His teaching.

Num. 14:17,18. Lack of faith in God affects succeeding generations.
Where parents do not teach their children, and set the example for them,
the children will follow the worldly ways of their parents. Moses prays
to God that somehow He will prevent this.

Num. 14:19-23. These verses provide great insight into how God's love
and grace can be shown while not compromising His justice and
righteousness. He forgives the people for their lack of faith, but He
still forbids the majority from entering the promised land.

Num. 14:24. Caleb was different. He listened to the Word of God every
day, and He maintained an attitude of faith that was in line with the
doctrine and promises he had learned. Therefore he had a relaxed mental
attitude and a good knowledge of how to function in God's plan.

Num. 14:25-30. A description of darkness in the soul. God calls this
people an evil congregation and pronounces the sin unto death on the
majority of the adult population.

The Second No-Water Test - Numbers 20

Historically, now, we are near the end of the 40 years wandering
occasioned by the sins and unbelief of the previous generation. Most of
those who were adults 39 years ago have died in the wilderness. Now
their children are adults, and they have apparently learned nothing! For
here is a repetition of the "no-water" test, in the same location and
virtually under the same circumstances as the first one.

Num. 20:1. Miriam died at this time, and she was buried in Kadesh. Her
death is representative of those who were removed under the final stage
of divine discipline, the sin unto death. Now the new generation faces
the issue of Faith-Rest living.

Num. 20:2. "There was no water for the congregation..." God will permit
tests of all sorts, usually in the form of some disaster, heartache,
frustration, or pressure situation which could be classified as a
"no-water" situation.

You can handle a "no-water" situation in two ways. You can try to solve
it yourself, or you can put it into the Lord's hands. The issue is what
takes place in the soul. Resting in God, claiming the promises, requires
categorical knowledge of the Word of God and a proper attitude of faith
toward the Lord and His teaching.

No hopeless situation is really hopeless when viewed from the divine
viewpoint. A believer who has Bible principle applied in his life is
going to manifest many things, including a relaxed mental attitude, true
happiness and joy, and a reliance on promises.

A no-water situation is never a no-water situation with God. He has
provided the "water" for every situation before the world was created.
But the promises of God are never superimposed on the believer's life.
They are an expression of His love, but God does not force His love upon
us.

The believer who does not live in the Word has mental sins, fears,
worry, anxiety, bitterness, etc. And this is expressed through
murmuring. The believer with doctrine in the soul expresses his own love
for God through Faith-Rest.

Num. 20:3. "The people chode (meribah) with Moses..." As soon as things
go wrong, the sin natures begins to express the darkness in the soul,
bitterness, implacability, fear. This causes the people to murmur
against the authority which God has provided and they blame Moses and
Aaron for the whole thing.

These people are actually suicidal, an evidence of great inconsistency,
extreme emotional swings, and complete disorientation to life.

Num. 20:4,5. Note, this "evil place" that the congregation is
complaining about is exactly the same place where God had demonstrated
His love and grace before, by providing water! The believer who calls
Grace "evil" has a badly scarred up soul. They have negative volition to
grace and the promises of God. In their self-consciousness they have
self-pity. Their mentality is dominated by mental attitude sins of
worry, bitterness, vindictiveness. Their emotions are unstable. And in
their conscience they have strictly human viewpoint and standards.

They are thinking of the details of life, and they expect the details of
life to bring them happiness. Any believer who ignores the Word of God
and looks to details of life for provision and happiness has had it! The
Word of God points the believer toward God; human viewpoint points him
toward Egypt.

When a believer recalls something from his past, something pleasant,
instead of recalling he promises of God, he is "looking back at Egypt."
A Christian who operates on Grace principles can take Egypt of leave it.
He will be confident and happy in any situation, because God is greater
than the most hopeless situation.

God demonstrates His love for us through adversity in a way that would
be impossible in Heaven. Heaven is perfect environment, with no problems
of any kind.

Hebrews 3:7-9 "Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says, today if you will
hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation (meribah:
from the Hebrew of Psalm 95:8-11), in the day of trial in the
wilderness, when your fathers put me to the testl, proved me, and say my
works forty years."

To "harden one's heart" means to have a habitual and willful unbelief in
God and His Word.

God was faithful to the people for the whole 40 years of wilderness
wandering, yet they failed the "no water" test.

The Benefits of Faith-Rest

As a Christian grows in grace, he will use Faith-Rest with increasing
skill and power, and it will support all of his divine viewpoint
thinking and production. Faith-Rest relies entirely on the continuous
ministry of the indwelling Holy Spirit, therefore the believer will
benefit from Faith-Rest only when he is in fellowship, walking in the
Spirit [Rom. 14:23].

Faith-Rest was the means of spirituality for believers in the Old
Testament. [See Hab. 2:4; Heb. 11; Rom. 4:17-25] One of the principle
passages relating to Faith-Rest is Hebrews 3 and 4, particularly the
section from 3:6 to 4:16. Please read this passage in your Bible before
proceeding.

Following are some principles of the Faith-Rest system:

Faith-Rest is from God, Who is perfect. No human works or deeds can be
added to this perfect divine provision.

To enter into God's rest, the believer must cease from his deeds (human
good) and enter into a rest in which he does no work. The Holy Spirit
does the work, Heb. 3:7 to 4:16.

Faith is required, not works. Faith implies the absence of human merit.
The merit for Faith-Rest lies in the object of faith, God the Father and
His Word. The doctrines and promises of the Word must be mixed with
faith, Heb. 4:1,2.

Faith-Rest produces a relaxed mental attitude and victory over mental
attitude sins, Isa. 26:3,4; Rom. 5:5.

Faith-Rest is the basis for dynamics in prayer, Mt. 21:22; Mk. 11:25.

Faith-Rest is a principle of victory in spiritual warfare, Heb. 11:6; 1;
Jn. 5:4,5.

Faith-Rest is a part of the Christian Way of Life in the Church Age, 2
Cor. 5:7.

The extent to which Faith-Rest applies to every aspect of a believer's
life can be seen in the more than 7,000 individual promises in the Bible
which can be claimed by the Christian in one way or another. See, for
example, 1 Pet. 5:7; Isa. 41:10; Ps. 4:8; 55:22; 56:3.

In order for Faith-Rest to function it is necessary for the Christian to
take in the Word of God on a daily basis, so that he learns which
promise provisions have been made availabl. And The Christian
continually filled (controlled) by the Holy Spirit through confessing
sin Biblically. Use of the Word of God in this manner provides the
following benefits:

Inner rest, the "peace of God that passes all understanding."

A happiness (+H) that does not depend on people, circumstances, or
things.

A relaxed mental attitude arising out of victory over sins of mental
attitude.

The ability to have genuine personal love toward those close to you and
genuine impersonal love toward others.

The desire to be occupied with Christ and to study God's Word more.

Divine provision for every need.

The key to the success of the Faith-Rest system lies in the validity of
the object of our faith, the Word of God Therefore, every aspect of the
perfect character (essence) of God the Father supports Faith-Rest.

How to Apply Faith-Rest

The objective of Bible teaching is the presentation of Bible doctrine
which the Christian can use in his daily life. People differ in their
abilities to retain and recall doctrines and promises when they are
needed.

You never know when you will be required to use a particular doctrine,
and you may be able to recall only a tiny amount of what you have heard
from the Pastor-Teacher in the past. For this reason, you must take in
doctrine on a daily basis so that usable doctrine accumulates gradually
in small increments, line upon line and precept upon precept.

There must also be continuous repetition of important principles and
reinforcement in learning how various Bible principles interrelate.

As you study the Bible you will discover that a divine frame of
reference is being built in your soul by which you can receive,
understand, and apply further doctrinal teaching. Truth builds upon
truth. Isa. 28:10. You will see that God's viewpoint is gradually
replacing your human viewpoint on many issues. You are building a set of
divine standards by which you will be able to exercise wisdom and
discernment and make correct decisions in life.

You will grow in spiritual maturity if you maintain continuous momentum
in the Christian Way of Life for an extended period of time. Your
personal intake of the Word of God constitutes its own reward as you
benefits from living the truth.

In the faith application of the Word of God, you will draw on your
accumulated resources of Bible teaching in order to cope with your
problems and take control of your own life. The Word of God in your soul
makes you self-sustaining, independent of anything in the world system,
and able to face life with courage and confidence as you fulfills God's
plan for your life.

Faith-Rest, then, is designed by God as a versatile technique for
overcoming problems in life. By FAITH you apply doctrine logically from
the resources in your soul, meanwhile you are RESTING in the promises of
the Word of God.

The steps in the Faith-Rest technique are:

​1. Establish fellowship with God (the filling of the Holy Spirit)
through Biblical confession of sin.

​2. You may then recover a relaxed mental attitude by claiming promises
from the Word.

​3. As a means of calling up divine viewpoint thinking, concentrate on
pertinent doctrines related to the issue at hand.

​4. Take control of the situation as you reach doctrinal conclusions.

An Example of Faith Rest - Victory Over Fear

Because concentration on Bible truth is so important, your mental
attitude is a prime target of Satan's attacks against the power of the
Word of God. Mental attitude sins and doctrinal thought cannot coexist.
Everyone is susceptible to various combinations of events,
circumstances, or people who cause arrogance, bitterness, depression,
self-pity, worry, anger - anything to block out God's thoughts.

One of your most potent enemies, for example, is fear. Fear is a mental
attitude sin which shuts down thought and closes out divine viewpoint.
No matter how much doctrine is resident in your soul, none of it will
help if your mind is immobilized by fear.

Note: It is not a sin to be scared, to be afraid of something that is
dangerous or which threatens to harm you. Sinful fear, though, is a
continuing morbid mental attitude in which you say, in effect, that God
cannot or will not protect you in time of danger.

Fear opposes the believer's confidence and courage in the Christian Way
of Life, 1 Jn. 4:18. It is not surprising to find that one of the
strategies most often used by Satan is that of causing believers to be
filled with fear.

To deal with fear, proceed as follows:

Confess sin . Fear is a sin. While confession will not conquer fear, it
must be the first step. The fear has caught you off guard and you must
quickly recover your mental poise and your ability to think and use
doctrine. Therefore, confession and restoration to fellowship is the
first requirement.

Claim promises. Following confession of sin, recover a relaxed mental
attitude by claiming promises found throughout the Word of God relating
to fear, such as

Isa. 41:10, "So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for
I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will uphold you with my
righteous right hand."

Rom. 8:28, "For we know in fact, that to those who love God, he works
all things together for good, to those who are the called ones according
to a predetermined plan."

If you don't remember many good promises, look them up in a concordance,
look at a list of promises, or call a friend for some help.

A promise is God's guarantee, a capsule statement of Bible doctrine on
which to anchor your mental attitude. A promise expresses the character
of God and provides you with an instant perspective on things and gives
you the ability to reduce the most complicated situation to utmost
simplicity. Where panic reigned, peace can now be restored.

Note: claiming promises is never an end in itself. It is only the
beginning of the application of Faith-Rest. Promises cannot sustain a
relaxed mental attitude and they cannot solve complex problems. Promises
are used to make possible the most important phase of Faith-Rest,
doctrinal thinking.

Apply doctrine. Your concentration on doctrine in Bible class and in
your studies has brought doctrine into your soul. Now you will apply
this doctrine by moving it to the front of your mind to meet the demands
of the moment. You will apply a "rationale" to the situation.

A "rationale" is a "reasoned exposition of principles or statements of
reasons; a set of reasoned rules or directions." By mentally tracing out
the principles related to a crisis, you are re-explaining to yourself
the basic concepts of doctrine that apply to the situation. This is
necessary because fear and the accompanying emotions have revolted
against thought, and you must take conscious and deliberate steps to
reinstate the rightful authority in your soul.

You could, for example, think through some conclusions derived from Rom.
8:29,30, "For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to
the likeness of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many
brothers, and those He predestinated, He also called, those He called,
He also justified; those He justified He also glorified." Your thought
process might go like this ...

First, "God thought about me in eternity past."

Next, "He designed a perfect plan for me in eternity past."

Then, "He chose me for a privileged part in His plan."

Therefore, "God can bless me right now because I possess His
righteousness."

Finally, "God will bless me forever in Heaven."

These simple statements are really a set of five basic doctrines which
help restore divine viewpoint thinking. By using this system of
concentrating on doctrines which you have already learned, you can
immediately recall your place in the overall picture of God's grace. By
this faith application of doctrine, you can become stabilized and regain
objectivity.

Take control of the situation.

Romans 8:31,32, "What conclusion are we forced to face with these
things? Since God is for us, Who is against us? Who did not spare His
own unique Son, but delivered Him over on our behalf, how shall He not
with Him graciously give us all things."

These conclusions, stated in these verses as rhetorical questions,
enable you to take control of situations which formerly caused fear and
anxiety. With objectivity and confidence restored, you can evaluate your
circumstances and make the decision or take the action which your own
wisdom and discernment dictate as the solution to the problem.

Even if the problem is hopeless, completely beyond your control, you can
still cope with it by intelligently trusting the Lord for a solution.

Any Bible doctrine you have stored in your human spirit can be developed
into a rationale to meet a test or crisis in your life.

At one time or another you will need every doctrine that you have had an
opportunity to learn.

If you find yourself lacking inner resources in time of crisis, it means
that you have not prepared yourself in advance for the testing. Testing
will come, ready or not.

Forgiveness
-----------

The word “forgive” is a Grace word, in the English as well as in the
Greek. An early meaning in English was “to give or to grant”. Then,
forgive came to mean “to remit a debt; to give up resentment or claim
for requital; to pardon an offense.”

All of us are debtors to others, to society as a whole. And we often
feel that people owe us many things in our human relationships. We feel
we are owed courtesy and consideration. Sometimes we think that we are
owed reward or status or promotion in some enterprise, or on the job. We
are certainly owed fair treatment, justice, restitution and many other
things.

But, many people in America are spiritually, ethically, and morally
bankrupt. They simply cannot pay society what they owe! They are
thoughtless, selfish, ungracious. What should a Christian do about all
of the debts owed to him. Answer: forgive them, as Christ forgave you.

A Christian who practices Grace thinking (divine viewpoint) will become
a forgiving person. To forgive means “to give up a claim; to cease
bearing resentment”.

The rich man in Luke 7 was able to forgive the two debtors because he
was prosperous. He gave to them out of his prosperity. A person can only
give to others out of what God has already provided in the way of
prosperity. In terms of money, the principle is “Let him that stole,
steal no more; rather, let him labor, doing with his hands the thing
that is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.”

As a growing Christian, you have many other kinds of prosperity, by the
Grace of God. You have intellectual prosperity (divine viewpoint). You
have spiritual prosperity (peace with God). You have emotional
prosperity (relaxed mental attitude). You have financial prosperity
(mastery of details of life). You have social prosperity (stable
marriage, stable family life, etc.).

Wherever in your life you find that someone else owes you something, you
have the wherewithal to forgive him! God has forgiven all of us who are
absolutely without resources of our own. And He is not expecting or
demanding some kind of payment in return for His Grace gifts. And we are
to be channels of Grace to the world. “Out of your innermost being shall
flow rivers of living water.”

Godliness
---------

This is a study of the Greek word (eusebeia), used in the New Testament
to express the idea of inner piety, spiritual maturity, or godliness. In
TITUS 1:1, the Apostle Paul states that he is an apostle of Jesus Christ
according to the criterion of the faith of the chosen people of God who
have a full and applied knowledge of the truth which is the standard for
godliness.

The word eusebeia has an interesting history. It was first used by the
Greek poet, Homer, in about 1000 BC. From Homer the word came into use
in the classical Greek of Athens (Attic Greek) where it referred to
personal piety in the fulfillment of human relationships. It was also
used to describe a person who was faithful in fulfilling his duties to
whatever Greek gods dominated the city in which he lived. The Attic
Greek word always referred to the outward expression of piety, such as
the giving of gifts to the god, participation in sacrifices and worship,
or making a show of religion in public.

As the word eusebeia began to be used in the koine Greek, it came to
mean “inner piety”, or spirituality, a duty which the believer owes to
God in the inner man. The principle in the Titus context is that of the
control or filling of the Holy Spirit which produces qualities of
conformity to Christ.

The following scripture passages contain the word eusebeia , invariably
translated “godliness” (in the KJV). Read these verses along with their
contexts before continuing in the next section.

ACTS 3:12

1 TIM. 2:2; 3:16; 4:7,8; 6:3,5,6,11

2 TIM. 3:5

2 PET. 1:3,6,7; 3:11

Principles of EUSEBEIA

A true man of God has qualities of inner piety - the characteristics of
a spiritually mature person. This is not a phony façade put on to please
or impress people. The source of this godliness is the Word of God. The
godly person has not only learned doctrine academically, but he has also
seen that word applied to his life in edification over a period of
years.

Spirituality is an absolute quality, depending on a believer’s walk with
the Lord, and particularly on his maintaining his fellowship with the
Lord through confession. But none of this is visible.

So - how can you tell when true spirituality and maturity are present?
Or, how do you know the difference between a godly man and one who is
merely well educated and in control of himself? A carnal believer, the
novice Christian, can be moral, can use the right vocabulary, can wear a
suit and carry a Bible. He can fool some of the people some of the time.

But the godly believer is known by “his fruits” - the fruit of the Holy
Spirit - things that an unbeliever, or the carnal believer, cannot
produce. Godliness is produced in the life of a Christian who is both
learning doctrine and growing thereby through edification.

Read GAL 5:19-21, the works of the flesh.

The works of the flesh are obvious enough. They are the product of an
inner life controlled by the sin nature, by the trends and lusts of the
soul. And as a Christian grows in Christ, he gains victory over areas of
weakness. The Christian Way of Life is characterized by the putting away
of negatives, the sin that so easily besets, and by putting on the new
man.

GAL. 5:22-26

EPH. 4:17-25.

The new man not only lives in the Spirit (not visible), but he also
walks in the Spirit (visible). One of the great themes of the Epistle to
Titus is that of the outward walk, which is a demonstration to the world
that the inner life which is claimed is genuine. Three illustrations are
given in Titus 2.

1.  In TITUS 2:4,5, young women are to be taught how to lead godly lives
    so that “the Word of God be not blasphemed.” We have a
    responsibility for public opinion about the Word of God.

2.  In 2:7,8, Titus himself is told to show himself a “pattern of good
    works” and to have “sound speech that cannot be condemned” in order
    not to supply detractors with ammunition for their criticisms.

3.  And in 2:9,10, servants are to maintain godly lives in their
    relations to their masters in order that they might “adorn the
    doctrine of God our Savior in all things.” We are to live as
    “decorations” to the doctrine of God.

The whole letter to Titus is an inspired document which, among other
things, provides many illustrations (in chapters 1 and 2) of how
godliness (eusebeia ) is supposed to be observed in the outward
characteristics of believers of all ranks: overseers and elders, older
men, older women, younger women, younger men, servants, and Titus
himself.

Godliness is the concept of the inward life and the outward appearance
of the fruit of the Spirit.

For example, in the spiritual fruit of love we see genuine care and
regard for people, an impersonal love for people who are different, even
though they are enemies. This love results in the philozenos of TITUS
1:8. [See the notes on Characteristics of Impersonal Love]. Love is the
absence of mental attitude sins and sins of the tongue. The negatives
have been eliminated from the believer’s life so that (1) he no longer
hates, despises, disdains, or envies other people, (2) he no longer
maligns or ridicules them, and therefore (3) he is free to have a
ministry with others that is not hindered by offensiveness or
bitterness.

Joy is the spiritual fruit which enables a Christian to have happiness
that does not depend on the details of life. He has a stable mental
attitude from looking to Jesus and trusting the Father for everything.
He does not fall into moody depression when things go wrong or he is
criticized of maligned. He does not fall into wide emotional swings. He
does not depend on others to prop up his happiness. I TIM. 6:6,
“Godliness (eusebeia) with contentment is great gain...”

A believer who has peace is a master of the Faith-Rest technique. He is
nearly unflappable, because he has a lot of practice in placing every
distress, every disaster, in the hands of the Lord. He is the most
relaxed person in the neighborhood. He does not have chronic worry about
the present or future. He knows that the Lord can handle everything. So
he is not paranoid. Even if someone is really out to get him, he is
relaxed and praying, even for the enemy who is plotting against him. He
places great confidence in the Lord, especially regarding death, knowing
and resting in the fact that “absent from the body” means “present with
the Lord.” So he is not one of those who “through fear of death are all
their lifetime subject to bondage” (HEB. 2:15).

Well, for homework, you can make up your own descriptions for the
remaining parts of the fruit of the Spirit: Longsuffering, Gentleness,
Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance. Just remember that God’s plan for
you is that you continue to be a godly Christian.

Grace
-----

Introduction

God the Father always thinks Grace. Whether He is dealing with nations
or individuals, whether he is exercising His divine justice, wrath,
love, or mercy, in whatever dispensation or time frame, at all times and
in all circumstances, the Grace of God influences His thoughts and
actions.

The absolute righteousness and justice of God the Father demand
perfection in us. But we are “sinners, condemned, unclean.” The Father’s
perfect justice demands a just penalty for sin - “the soul that sinneth,
it shall die.”

But the Father, in His love for us, seeing that we could not meet His
standards, sent His Son to bear our penalty so that we “might be made
the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Cor. 5:21) Righteousness was
imputed to us on the sole condition of our faith in Jesus Christ, just
as “Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness.”
(Gen. 15:6)

God the Father is now able to look upon us as righteous. And He is able
to express His love for us in countless ways during our lifetime. The
word “grace” is used to refer to God’s giving to us out of His love for
us, a giving that is unrestricted because our former condemnation has
been removed, our penalty has been paid, God’s righteousness and justice
have been satisfied, and we are “in Christ” and share the love that the
Father has for His own Son.

Mastery of the Bible’s teaching about Grace is the most important goal
of the Christian Way of Life. Your productivity as a believer, your
ability to function effectively as member of your local church, your
effectiveness in the use of your spiritual gifts in reaching out to
others - all are absolutely dependent on how well you understand and use
Grace principles. The following are some of the reasons why the subject
of Grace is so important to every Christian:

Grace is the most important single concept in the Word of God. Salvation
is “by Grace through faith”, and the Christian way of Life functions
entirely on Grace principles.

Grace provides the foundational structure for all Bible study. Eph. 2

Knowledge of Grace principles gives believers great knowledge and
confidence in God’s Plan, His provisions, His blessings.

The doctrine of Grace gives believers confidence in witnessing and
teaching, both for evangelism and the Christian Way of Life. Grace gives
Christians insight into the workings of society and God’s actual
intentions regarding the future.

Grace convinces believers that human righteousness is completely out of
the picture.

Through Grace, believers become “conduits of Grace” to society. Families
become Grace families; churches become Grace churches, centers of Grace
influence.

The goal of this study, then, is to learn how God thinks and how we can
have “divine viewpoint” in our own thinking. With Jesus Christ as the
“chief cornerstone”, we develop the “foundation” of the doctrine of
Grace, from the “apostles and prophets” by studying the Bible vocabulary
dealing with Grace, by developing principles of the doctrine of Grace,
and by illustration and application.

Etymology: Bible Vocabulary Related to Grace

This study contains a thorough review of all words in the Bible which
are related to the topic of Grace. The context of each verse was
studied, especially considering it with respect to etymology, doctrine,
and application. Word study and doctrinal source materials include the
following:

Vine, Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words

Moulton and Milligan: The Vocabulary of the Greek New Testament

Kittel’s Greek Lexicon

Various references to the Greek of the Septuagint

Chafer, L.S.: Systematic Theology

Books and Tapes by R. B. Thieme and Chester McCalley

The Grace vocabulary of the Bible begins with the word (chara), “joy;
gladness”. This word was widely used to express the idea of a joyous
response to something good; it sometimes meant “festival” or “wedding”.
And chara was widely used as a proper name!

In the Oxyrhyncus Papyrii [P Oxy VIII, 1162], a Christian man’s personal
letter included the greeting, “Leon, elder, to the elders and deacons,
beloved brothers in the Lord, fullness of joy (chara).” The word chara
is used in the following Bible passages:

Matt. 2:10, “When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
joy (chara).”

Matt. 5:12, “Rejoice and be exceeding glad (chara): for great is your
reward in heaven..."

Matt. 13:44 , "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a
field; when a man has found it, he hides, and for joy (chara) thereof
goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field."

Matt. 18:13 describes the Lord’s joy (chara) at finding the lost sheep.

Matt. 25:21, 23, "His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful
servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things: enter into the joy (chara) of thy lord."

We begin to see the relationship between joy and that which causes joy,
namely, the favor and bounty which we receive from the Lord.

Luke 2:10, "...behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy (chara),
which shall be to all people." This emphasizes the idea of CHARA as an
occasion of rejoicing.

Phil. 4:1, "Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy
(chara) and crown, so stand fast in the Lord ..."

1 Thess. 2:19, 20, "For what is our hope, or joy (chara), or crown of
rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at
his Coming? For ye are our glory and hope."

Related words are the verb (chairo), “to rejoice; to be glad; to be
joyful” and the word (chaire), used as a greeting “Hail! or Health!”
upon meeting or separating and used widely as a salutation or closing of
letters.

Acts 15:23, "And they wrote letters by them after this manner: The
apostles and elders and brethren send greeting (chairo) unto the
brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia."

Matt. 26:49, “Judas...came to Jesus and said, HAIL, master; and kissed
him.”

“HAIL, King of the Jews...” was shouted in derision at Christ before His
crucifixion.

“HAIL, Mary, highly favored...” was the greeting of the angel to Mary.
Note: the verses does not say “full of grace”. Mary was a recipient of
Grace, not the source of Grace!

A curious use of chairo is seen in 2 John 10,11, "If there come any unto
you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house,
neither BID him GOD SPEED (chairo): for he that BIDS him GOD SPEED is
partaker of his evil deeds." That is, we are to offer no joy to false
teachers.

The verb (charidzomai) is used several ways in the Bible. It means “to
gratify; to bestow in kindness; to grant as a free favor.” In each of
the Bible passages below, try to determine what it is that shows the
Lord’s Grace mental attitude.

Luke 7:21, “And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and
plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave
(charidzomai) sight.”

Rom. 8:32, “He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?”

Charidzomai also has the meaning of “to remit; to forgive”.

Luke 7:42, “A creditor had two debtors...And when they had nothing to
pay, he frankly forgave (charidzomai) them both...”

2 Cor 2:7,10, “To whom you forgive anything, I also: for if I forgave
(charidzomai) any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave
it in the person of Christ.”

Application: Forgiveness

The word “forgive” is a Grace word, in the English as well as in the
Greek. An early meaning in English was “to give or to grant”. Then,
forgive came to mean “to remit a debt; to give up resentment or claim
for requital; to pardon an offense.”

All of us are debtors to others, to society as a whole. And we often
feel that people owe us many things in our human relationships. We feel
we are owed courtesy and consideration. Sometimes we think that we are
owed reward or status or promotion in some enterprise, or on the job. We
are certainly owed fair treatment, justice, restitution and many other
things.

But, many people in America are spiritually, ethically, and morally
bankrupt. They simply cannot pay society what they owe! They are
thoughtless, selfish, ungracious. What should a Christian do about all
of the debts owed to him. Answer: forgive them, as Christ forgave you.

A Christian who practices Grace thinking (divine viewpoint) will become
a forgiving person. To forgive means “to give up a claim; to cease
bearing resentment”.

The rich man in Luke 7 was able to forgive the two debtors because he
was prosperous. He gave to them out of his prosperity. A person can only
give to others out of what God has already provided in the way of
prosperity. In terms of money, the principle is “Let him that stole,
steal no more; rather, let him labor, doing with his hands the thing
that is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.”

As a growing Christian, you have many other kinds of prosperity, by the
Grace of God. You have intellectual prosperity (divine viewpoint). You
have spiritual prosperity (peace with God). You have emotional
prosperity (relaxed mental attitude). You have financial prosperity
(mastery of details of life). You have social prosperity (stable
marriage, stable family life, etc.).

Wherever in your life you find that someone else owes you something, you
have the wherewithal to forgive him! God has forgiven all of us who are
absolutely without resources of our own. And He is not expecting or
demanding some kind of payment in return for His Grace gifts. And we are
to be channels of Grace to the world. “Out of your innermost being shall
flow rivers of living water.”

Another Grace word is the noun (charisma), “a free gift; a benefit; a
spiritual gift.” An interesting use is seen in Romans 1:11, “For I long
to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift (charisma),
to the end you may be established.” This is not a spiritual gift from
the Holy Spirit, but a spiritual benefit which Paul wished to share with
the Roman Christians. [ For the uses of charisma as “spiritual gift”,
see 1 Cor. 12:4,9,28,30,30 and Romans 12. ]

Rom. 6:23, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift (charisma) of
God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

But how did this happen? How can God give such a gift to us?

Rom. 5:15, “But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if
through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and
the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto
many.”

To comprehend this fully, you must study the context. The complete
context of Romans 5:15 ranges from Romans 2:1 to 6:2 (at least)!

A very important Grace word is (chari\~), which has a variety of
translations in the New Testament, including “favor; pleasure; gift;
benefit; liberality; and gratitude” as illustrated in the following
scriptures.

Luke 1:30, “And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for you have
found favor (chari\~) with God.”

Luke 2:52, “And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor
(chari\~) with God and man.

Acts 24:27 and 25:9 use charis with respect to pleasure.

2 Cor. 8:4, “Praying with us with much entreaty that we would receive
the gift (chari\~), and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering
to the saints.”

2 Cor. 1:14,15, “As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are
your rejoicing, even as ye also are out's in the day of the Lord Jesus.
And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye
might have a second benefit (chari\~).” This usage emphasizes that the
benefit, or gift, is the effect of the gracious disposition of the
benefactor.

1 Cor. 16:3, “And when I come, whoever you shall approve by your
letters, them will I send to bring your liberality (chari\~) to
Jerusalem.”

It is in the idea of gratitude, as the response of the one who receives
a Grace benefit, that we begin to see the means by which God causes the
correct response in people. A free gift brings a joyous, thankful
response.

Rom. 6:17, “But God be thanked (chari\~) [that is, ‘grace to God’] that
you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that
form of doctrine which was delivered to you.”

2 Cor. 1:14, “Now thanks (chari\~) be unto God, which always causes us
to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the savor of His knowledge by
us in every place.” See also 8:16 and 9:15.

1 Tim. 1:12, “And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for
that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry.”

1 Pet. 2:18 to 20, “Servants, be subject to your masters with all
respect; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the unreasonable.
For this is thankworthy (chari\~), if a man for conscience toward God
endure grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if, when you
are buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when
you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is
acceptable (GRACE) with God.

READ also Luke 6:32 to 36

Other common Greek words for gratitude or thankfulness are (eucharistia)
and (eucharisto\~), which are derived from (chari\~) as well. There are
very few examples of these in the papyrii, but there is a copy of a
letter written by the Emperor Claudius expressing his gratification at
games performed in his honor.

The Latin word gratia is brought into the English in the words
“grateful” and “gratitude), etc. The Greek eucharistia is brought into
the English in “Eucharist”, still used, but mainly by the high church,
to refer to the Lord’s Supper or Communion service. In modern English,
the connotation of Grace is barely visible in “Eucharist.”

Thanksgiving is the expression of joy towards God by a person who has
been the recipient of God’s Grace. The mature Christian’s gratitude,
therefore, is a part of the joy that is the fruit of the Spirit; thus it
increases with edification.

Col. 2:7, “Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as
you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving
(eucharistia).”

2 Cor. 4:14,15, “Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. For all things
are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the
thanksgiving (eucharistia) of many rebound to the glory of God.”

1 Thess. 3:9, “For what thanks (eucharistia) can we render to God again
for you, for all the joy (chara) wherewith we joy (chairo) for your
sakes before God.” Grace on the part of the giver; gratitude on the part
of the receiver an illustration of the Doctrine of Reciprocal Grace.

READ 2 Cor. 9:10 to 12.

Eph. 5:4, “Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which
are not appropriate, but rather, giving of thanks (eucharistia).” This
leads us to a discussion of ...

The Greek word (eucharisteo), a verb which has the basic meaning of “to
give thanks.”

From the early Greek eucharisteo meant “to do a good turn to” or “to
oblige”, as in the Flinders Petrie Papyrii, “by doing this you will
oblige (eucharisteo) us”, or in Grenfell and Hunt on the Hibeh Papyrii,
“so that you shall not oblige me to no purpose.”

In later Greek, this passed easily into the meaning of being grateful,
or for giving thanks for something received. So in [P Oxy I (AD 303)],
“so I shall be enabled to recover my property and acknowledge my
gratitude (eucharisteo) to your excellency.”

Paul gives thanks (eucharisteo) for his readers in his greetings of
Romans, Ephesians, Colossians, and Thessalonians. He gives thanks in
Phil. 1:3 for fellowship shared with him. And he gives thanks in 1 Cor.
1:4 for God’s gifts to the Christians.

This word is used by Paul to remind believers to give thanks. “Giving
thanks (eucharisteo) always for all things unto God and the Father in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Eph. 5:20)

The word is used negatively in referring to the unthankful heathen.
“Neither were thankful, but became vain in the their imaginations...”,
(Rom. 1:21).

God’s Operating Principle

Ephesians 2:4-7 discusses Grace as God's operating principle. Verse 4
starts with certain facts on God's side God is the possessor of infinite
resources; He is "rich in mercy", and He has "great love". Man, on the
other hand, is described as "dead". Man has the deepest need; God has
the greatest resources. And God has a plan for linking our need to His
resources (Eph. 2:5).

Romans 4:4 states plainly that Grace is the opposite of a merit plan.
Two principles of operation are stated here, a "debt" principle and a
"grace" principle. In a "debt" plan, reward is given in return for
effort of some kind. A "grace" principle is one in which reward is given
on the basis of the merits of another, Jesus Christ. The two principles
are mutually exclusive; they cannot be combined or mixed.

Romans 6:16-23 points out the contrast between "wages" and the gift
principle.

Romans 4:13-16 explains that if the Law (debt principle) will make us
heirs, then faith (grace principle) "is made void." This allows for no
compromise. Verse 16 says "It is of faith that it might be by grace."
Faith is the only action on man's part that can appropriate blessing
without ruining the Grace principle. Satan is always eager to add
something to faith, because that would ruin Grace and negate divine
blessing.

Romans 3:23-31 shows that, while in Grace salvation is free, yet the Law
is established and upheld.

So “Grace” is the word used in the Bible to refer to all that God is
free to do for mankind because of the Lord Jesus Christ’s sacrifice for
sins, the Work done for us on the Cross.

Grace means that God has done the work and God receives the “credit”,
the glory. Man, who is unable to produce acceptable works, receives the
free benefits of God’s work. Grace means that man has received from God
that which he has not earned or deserved; because nothing that we are
and nothing that we have is sufficient to qualify us for any of what the
Lord gives to us or does for us.

Grace, or graciousness, is the most outstanding quality of the mature
believer in Christ. The new believer has "tasted Grace". As he grows in
Christ, he learns to "think Grace" (outward) rather than thinking pride
(inward). He thinks Grace in time of doubt, in time of poverty, in time
of prosperity, in suffering and pressure, and even in persecution.

The advanced Christian is gracious, forgiving, unassuming. He is
uplifting, not depressing. Out of his innermost being flow rivers of
living water; he is a conduit that brings Grace to a thirsty world.

Categories of Grace

In the following paragraphs, the subject of Grace is discussed under
four headings.

COMMON GRACE, or Grace which is common to all mankind, saved or unsaved
, such as the rain which falls on the just and unjust.

SAVING GRACE, the “gift of God, lest any man should boast”, namely,
Grace applied to the lost sinner.

LIVING GRACE, the provision of God the Father for the needs of the
believer for the rest of his lifetime. God provides everything that is
needed for a prosperous, happy life for any believer who has “tasted
grace” and avails himself of “more grace”.

SURPASSING GRACE, the Grace of God in eternity; what we will receive
from God because of Salvation; what we will receive from God as crowns
or rewards to be laid at the feet of Christ.

Common Grace

Every human being is born under the complete watchfulness of God. God
provides each person with an awareness of the existence of God and with
a bonafide opportunity to exercise a choice with respect to God.

ROM. 1:18-22

ACTS 17:22-30

PS. 19:16

In Grace, God has provided many blessings common to all people, whether
they are Christians or not. It rains on the just and unjust alike; and
Bible history shows us that material prosperity is often given to
unbelievers as a demonstration of God's Grace to all people. MATT.
5:43-48

God has provided Divine Institutions for the protection and preservation
of the human race, and everyone profits from this. The Lord intends that
people live under conditions of freedom and morality.

The institution of Volition makes it possible, among other things, for
everyone to have a free will choice in all spiritual matters. The
institutions of Marriage and Family provide for the orderly preservation
of the human race and the growth of families in a protected, nurturing
environment. The institution of Nations gives a simple structure to
society so that personal freedom and individual morality are preserved.
The topical notes on Divine Institutions provide more information on
this subject.

God the Father provides gospel information to any person who shows any
positive inclination toward Him when the individual become conscious of
God. And God the Holy Spirit makes the gospel clear to the unbeliever so
that he can accept Christ if he wants to.

ACTS 17:26,27; JOHN 7:16,17

Meanwhile, by Grace God withholds His judgment and wrath from mankind.
He is longsuffering, giving everyone ample opportunity to repent or
change his mental attitude toward Christ. 2 PETER 3:9

Saving Grace

The term "Saving Grace" covers the categories of doctrines which deal
with all that Christ did for us on the Cross. The general topic of
Saving Grace includes salvation and all of the teaching regarding
Positional Truth, the dozens of things God does for believers at the
moment of salvation. Read the notes entitled Salvation Doctrines for a
complete listing of these topics.

You can get an appreciation for the extent of what the believer receives
at salvation, by reading Ephesians 1. In just the first few verses you
have the following blessings:

1:2 "Grace to you and peace..."

1:3 "all spiritual blessings in Christ"

1:4 "chosen in Him"

1:4 "without blame before Him"

1:5 We are adopted by Christ

1:6 We are accepted in the Beloved

1:7 We are redeemed, forgiven

1:8 God's wisdom and prudence are available.

1:9 God's will is made known

ROMANS 3:24 says that justification offered on the Grace principle is
"through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." Grace can be extended
freely to us because of the price paid by Jesus Christ. The cost of
salvation was the death of Christ on the Cross.

Grace is the only way that God could save man and still be consistent
with His perfect character. ACTS 4:12 The Grace basis for salvation is
seen in the following verses:

EPH. 2:8,9

PSA. 103:8-12

ROM. 3:23,24; 4:4; 5:20

2 COR. 8:9

HEB. 2:9

TITUS 2:11; 3:7

Living Grace

Every Christian has experienced Grace at least once in his lifetime. He
has "tasted Grace." 1 PET. 2:2,3. The believer is said to be a child of
God, no longer an enemy. Christ did the most for His enemies by bearing
our sins when He died on the Cross. Since he did the most for us when we
were His enemies, how much will He do for us now that we are His own
children. The answer "much more than the most". Grace is the concept of
a life in which God gives us the most then gives us much more than the
most.

ROM. 5:9-17; 8:32; 11:12

HEB. 9:14

Once having tasted Grace, the believer can go on to have all of the
Grace he wants. To obtain all the blessings that God provides, a
Christian must exercise his free will by choosing the things of God. The
most important thing is the believer's attitude toward the Word of God.
The Lord provides believers with the capacity to grow and be effective
so that they can glorify God in this lifetime. In fact, the Christian is
commanded to grow in Grace, 2 PET. 3:18.

Very little knowledge is required to accept Christ as Savior. But
extensive knowledge is required during the believer's remaining lifetime
in order to profit from Grace. Every facet of a Christian's life
requires an applied understanding of the Word and orientation to the
Grace of God.

God's Grace is always available for the believer. In fact, the Lord
waits to pour out His Grace to us, ISA. 30:18–19.

Grace is sufficient for every problem.

Grace is greater than sin, ROM. 5:20.

Grace is greater than suffering, 2 COR. 12:9,10.

Grace is greater than Satan, JAMES 4:6,7.

A special provision of Grace is dying Grace, for the Christian who is in
the dying stage of life, whether that stage lasts two hours or two
years, PS. 23:4. Dying Grace enables the believer to enjoy dying even
though he might be having great physical pain.

A Christian who neglects God's Word creates a vacuum in his own spirit,
that part of him which can understand and assimilate Bible truth. Into
this vacuum will come false teaching, religion, legalism, and Satanic
doctrines which further distort his orientation to the Plan of God. Eph.
4:17 and following. Therefore, failure to participate in the Plan of God
is the believer's greatest occupational hazard. HEB. 12:15; GAL. 5:4.

The following are some examples of God's Grace provision for the
Christian life:

Grace in God's acceptance: EPH. 1:6

Grace in confidence in God's plan: 2 THESS. 2:16

Grace in prayer: HEB. 4:16

Grace in daily provision: PSA. 84:11; ACTS 4:33,34; ROM. 8:32

Grace in suffering: 2 COR. 12:9,10

Grace in God's patience with us: PSA. 103:8-12

Grace in releasing the power of God: 2 TIM. 2:1

Grace in victory over sin: ROM. 6:14

Grace in spiritual growth: 2 PET. 3:18; ACTS 20:32; 1 COR. 15:10

Grace in spiritual gifts: ROM. 12:6; EPH. 3:7,8; 4:7

Grace in stability: 1 PET. 5:12

Grace in becoming gracious: 2 COR. 8:19\*\*; COL. 4:6; 1 PET. 4:10

Grace in method of living: HEB. 12:28; 2 COR. 1:12; ROM. 11:6

Grace in worship of God: COL. 3:16

Grace in the production of divine good: 1 COR. 15:10; 2 COR. 6:1;
9:8–11; EPH. 4:29

Surpassing Grace

Surpassing Grace includes all that God is free to do for the believer in
eternity. This Grace is based primarily on the Christian's relationship
to Jesus Christ. In addition, the believer receives rewards and crowns
in heaven, which are a part of Grace provision. Study the following
Bible passages:

EPH. 2:7; JOHN 14:13

1 COR. 9:25; PHIL. 4:1

1 THESS. 2:19; 4:13-17

2 TIM. 4:8; JAMES 1:12

1 PET. 1:3,4: 5:12

2 PET. 3:13; REV. 21:4

Distortions of Grace

As you can well imagine, Satan's main personal task on this earth is to
distort what the Bible teaches about Grace. There are two basic ways to
distort or pervert the idea of Grace (taking it to mean or imply
something that it does not).

First, Grace is sometimes taken to mean that is permissible to sin.
Thus, Grace is used as an excuse for licentiousness, emphasizing overt
sins. This is always condemned by the Word of God. ROM. 6:1,2; 1 JOHN
1:9 TO 2:1; JUDE 4.

Then, Grace is sometimes taken as permission to be lazy (especially to
skip Bible study). This emphasizes sins of omission. But this idea
violates all of the Bible's commands to study, to be diligent, to be
oriented to Grace. HEB. 6:11,12; 2 PET. 1:5,10; 1 COR. 15:10

The greatest enemy of Grace is legalism. Grace and legalism are mutually
exclusive, ROM. 11:6. Grace means that God does the "work" and receives
the glory (credit) for it. Legalism means that man does the work and
receives the credit. [ Notes are available on the doctrine of Legalism.]

Grace depends solely on the character of God and entirely excludes human
ability, human merit, human achievement, etc. Legalism, however, depends
on human activity and ability.

Grace and legalism have opposite emphasis. Grace emphasizes what God
does in the soul of man, free of charge. The production and blessings in
the Christian's life are byproducts of what is first provided by God
without cost. Legalism excludes the mental attitude and emphasizes overt
activity for the purpose of gaining credit with God and impressing men.

Legalism hinders a person from accepting Christ as Savior, GAL. 2:21.

Legalism neutralizes the believer in the Christian Way of Life, GAL. 5:2
TO 4.

God is perfect, and His plan is perfect. Man's work is excluded from the
plan of God because man is imperfect. If man were permitted to make a
contribution to the Plan of God, the plan would no longer be perfect; it
would be no stronger than its weakest link. Grace eliminates all
considerations of human merit.

Grace, then, in the antithesis of human arrogance. An awareness of the
full meaning of Grace is a giant step toward true humility. Four types
of pride are noted in those who are not oriented to Grace:

There is pride on the part of the believer who rejects the eternal
security of Grace. He thinks his sins are greater than the plan of God.
He thinks that Grace is not sufficient.

There is pride in the believer who falls apart during suffering. He
thinks that his pressures and adversities are greater than the provision
and protection of God.

There is pride in the believer who enters into a life of false
spirituality through legalism or religion. He thinks his personal works
impress God and are greater than His plan.

There is pride in the emotional believer who thinks feelings and
emotions are greater and more real than the Word of God or the Grace of
God.

How to Grow in Grace

Victory over the Sin of Pride

As we have seen, one of the greatest enemies of Grace is native human
pride, one of the greatest evils since the Fall of Man. It is the worst
of the mental attitude sins because it amounts to blasphemy. “I will be
my own God.” Remember the times that Satan said “I will...” Grace
opposes human pride in every way.

There is great pressure toward arrogance in the United States. Our
country has a successful, affluent society with many opportunities for
achievement and rewards, from childhood on. Status and upward mobility
are available to everyone, and it’s easy to get the big head, to think
that we have accomplished something, to have the “self made man
complex.” Victory over this very subtle and devastating mental attitude
sin requires a thorough understanding of the doctrine of Grace.

The first step in victory over pride (and growth in Grace thinking) is
to be aware that pride is part of everyone’s Sin Nature. No one starts
out thinking Grace!!

The second step is to pray for victory here and to ask the Lord for
wisdom in the matter.

The third step is to confess sinful pride when you recognize it in
yourself.

There are many symptoms of pride. Indignation at someone else’s
behavior, mistakes, shortcomings, lack of discipline, or failure to
measure up is an indicator of selfrighteousness, whose basis is pride.
“Well, I never...” these are key pride words. ROMANS 2:13 commands that
we should not judge others as if we ourselves had no areas of weakness.
Self-promotion, and the demotion of other people is pride, it is the
failure to think Grace.

Another symptom of pride is lack of forgiveness, the holding of grudges.
Pride prevents a forgiving attitude. How many marriages break up because
of this? How many people would be happy on the job instead of miserable
if they could just forgive the boss or a fellow worker for doing
something dumb? Everybody does dumb things, but failure to forgive is
pride. Other indicators of pride are complaining, griping, maligning,
gossiping. Most of the sins of the tongue have their roots in pride.

When you see sinful pride in yourself, confess it! If you see it in
others, pray!

The fourth step toward progress in Grace thinking is to “grow in Grace”;
actually this is the first and last step toward maturity. Grace thinking
overcomes pride, and the symptoms of sinful pride will start to
disappear. A person who was at first totally filled with himself will
find that as he grows in Christ the symptoms will show up only under
extreme pressure. At that time, they will be recognized and dealt with
immediately to minimize the ill effects on himself and others.

Grace Orientation

The first step in Grace orientation is understanding the Grace of God,
the purpose of this study. The second step is to appropriate the Grace
of God through the use the techniques of Christian living seen in the
following sections. [ Each of the techniques described briefly below has
a complete discussion in the Bible Notes Library studies relating to
each topic. ]

Confession of Sin

Personal sin leads the believer away from the Christian Way of Life. You
must deal with sin on a daily basis by confessing and moving on. If you
don't do this, sin becomes a burden which clouds your joy, drains your
spiritual energy, and destroys your productivity and vitality. The
result will be that you will seek provision for your needs and desires
outside of God's Grace provision.

In privacy, make a list of mental attitude sins, verbal sins, and
behavior sins which bother you the most. Ask the Lord to make you aware
of the habits of your own life. Respond immediately to the Holy Spirit
when He uses the Word to spotlight your sin. Name the sin to God; then
rejoice in forgiveness and cleansing and your renewed fellowship with
God.

All the promises and provisions of God the Father are now available to
you. Make it a spiritual habit to confess sins whenever they show up in
your life and you will have continuous and immediate access to
everything that Grace provides.

The Faith Rest Life

Faith Rest is the believing of the promises of God and then entering
into the "rest" phase of Christian living by claiming and enjoying those
promises. Therefore, you must search the Scriptures daily to remind
yourself of promises and to learn new ones.

You must know who and what God is so that you will not hesitate to
believe that He can do what He has promised to do. Study the attributes
of God using verses about the Essence of God. Know Him as He reveals
Himself in the Bible. Believe Him when He tells you what He will do for
you. Count on it. Let your faith rest on it. Cast your burden on the
Lord. Everything you learn about Grace will encourage and strengthen
you.

Occupation with Christ

The technique of Occupation with Christ keeps your mind on Grace because
it gets your eyes off yourself, your spouse, your children, your
neighbors, your friends. Instead, as you move through the day, you are
thinking about the Lord Jesus Christ, His plan for your life, the
Father's provision for each incident in your life, and His provision of
wisdom for each decision you must make. Occupation with Christ is a
byproduct of the Faith Rest Life. Disorientation to Grace is a byproduct
of occupation with self, with life, with problems.

Living in the Word

By Living in the Word you are constantly reminded of God's viewpoint, of
His Plan, of His provision, or His awareness of our spirit of heaviness
and what He want to accomplish in us with the testing. Living in the
Word gradually transplants you to a new sphere, a new environment for
your life, in which there is victory through Grace.

The Filling of the Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit fills you and controls your life when you have no
unconfessed sin in your life. You can trust the Holy Spirit to reveal
sin to you when you commit it, or even before. When the Holy Spirit in
control, He produces His fruit (GAL. 5:12), the product of graciousness
which is such a blessing to others.

Agape love is a great Grace benefit. There is joy in living in Grace.
Peace does not coexist with disorientation to Grace. Longsuffering gives
the ability to wait for God's Grace provision. Gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, and temperance are fruits of righteousness, which is
divine good.

Orientation to Grace

Grace Orientation gives the ability to look at people and see them as
God sees them. It is the ability to let them live their lives as unto
the Lord, and trusting God to make His way clear to them. This technique
lets people make mistakes without your judging them. It enables you to
accept criticism without hurt or bitterness. It enables you to "esteem
other better than yourself", to "do nothing through strife or
vainglory." You will be a "conduit of Grace."

Mastery of the Details of Life

We are all involved with details of life. Either we master them, or they
master us! If you are a slave to one or more details of life, your
thoughts are devoted to them, and they drive you. They dominate your
thinking, your conversation, your decisions. Slavery to the details of
life leads to a search for happiness through the non-Grace provision of
the world and Satan.

Mastery of the details of life means that you look to the Lord for every
detail. Your happiness does not depend on people, circumstances or
things. You have the peace of God that passes understanding. You have
learned to be content under any circumstances. You can wait for the
Lord's timing in providing the details you want; you can enjoy them when
you have them; and you can stay happy when the Lord sees fit not to
provide some detail.

Relaxed Mental Attitude

A relaxed mental attitude is based on knowing God and on having divine
production in the soul that comes with the fruit of the Holy Spirit. A
relaxed mental attitude is one of the results of Living in the Word,
practicing the Faith Rest Life, and being occupied with Christ.

Capacity to Love

There may be many disturbing details that surround our relationships
with other people or the circumstances of our lives. Love deals with
that depression by giving us the capacity to have a Spirit produced love
for God (1 Cor. 16:22); for spouse (Titus 2:4); for others (Rom. 12:13).
This is only one of the marvelous products of Grace in the Christian's
life.

Inner Happiness

Inner happiness is not possible for the believer who is occupied with
himself . Inner happiness is a state of rejoicing based on knowing that
God is everything He claims to be and that He can and will do what He
has promised. Inner happiness is the joy of living where every provision
for physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being is being made by God
in the life of a Christian who is walking in daily fellowship with Him.

Heresy and Apostasy
-------------------

The words "heresy" and "apostasy" are two of the most often used words
to refer to doctrinal error and practice in the Church Age.

Any Christian is subject to error in his thinking about spiritual
matters. The presence of the sin nature in the soul guarantees that we
will have a constant battle to distinguish between human and divine
viewpoints. Error may be the result of ignorance, of a lack of doctrine,
or of deliberately adopting some point of view or activity.

The open-minded Christian who is positive to the teaching of the Bible
and who is willing for the Lord to deal with him in doctrinal matters
will find that his erroneous ideas will be replaced with the truth of
the Word of God. As he grows in Christ, he will avoid heresy and any
deliberate apostasy.

Heresy itself, which is the result of making a wrong choice among
competing ideas, may have been entered into as a result of being
deceived (EPH. 4:11-18) or of falling into a snare of Satan. Heresy
becomes apostasy, however, whenever a person deliberately decides to
reject Bible truth and maintain and promote false ideas. This paper is
written to help believers avoid error, heresy, or apostasy.

HERESY

The word "heresy" comes from the Greek (hairesi\~) meaning, "a choice; a
taking for oneself; a sect or school of philosophy". Hence, in the
Bible, it means (1) a chosen course of thought or action; (2)
dissensions arising from diversity of opinions and aims; or (3)
doctrinal departures from revealed truth, or erroneous doctrinal views.

The apostles warned the church continuously against such non-Biblical
views. Note particularly the stern directions to Titus regarding the
correction of problems caused in Crete by Judaistic heresies.

In the Apostolic Age we find three fundamental forms of heresy. These
have appeared in one form or another in every generation since.

JUDAISM

Judaism is the false counterpart of Jewish Christianity which insists on
combining Jewish practice with Christianity. This tends to cause
Christianity to sink to the level of Judaism in that it makes the Gospel
merely the perfection which they suppose can be obtained by keeping the
Law. Judaism regards Christ as a mere prophet, a second Moses; it denies
His divine nature, His priestly function, and His kingly offices.

Judaism holds that circumcision, sacrifice, etc. are to be binding on
Christians and necessary for salvation. There is no conception of
Christianity as a new, free, and universal religion. Judaism appears in
the 2nd Century A.D. in a more fully developed version under the name of
Ebionism.

GNOSTICISM

Gnosticism spread through the whole church during the first two or three
centuries after Christ. This heresy was an opposite reaction to Judaism.
It separated Christianity completely from Jewish influence with the
result that it tried to eliminate any connection to the true historical
foundations of Christianity. Gnosticism denies the humanity of Christ,
and it adulterates Christianity with pagan ideas and practices.

SYNCRETISM

Syncretism combines Judaism, and then Christianity, with heathen
philosophies, especially those of Pythagoras and Plato, so that, under
the Christian name, there appeared confused combinations of these
opposing systems, forming either a paganized Judaism or a Christianized
paganism, depending on which element prevailed.

Whatever the differences in the heresies, all amount to a distinct
denial of the Gospel, the incarnation of the Son of God for the
salvation of the world. They make Christ either a mere man or a mere
superhuman phantom; they allow no real and lasting union of the Divine
and human natures in the person of the Redeemer. Heresy disturbed the
unity of doctrine and of fellowship in the early church, which was
therefore forced to exclude those holding false doctrine from it
communion (TITUS 3:10). Once excluded, however, heretics formed
societies of their own.

Heresy becomes apostasy when there is a deliberate holding to error in
spite of knowing the truth of the Word of God. A heretic becomes
apostate at the point when he hears the truth and decides against it.

APOSTASY

Apostasy is the deliberate act of a professing Christian who knowingly
and deliberately rejects revealed truth regarding the deity of Jesus
Christ, redemption through His atoning sacrifice, or any part of the
doctrines related to Salvation. The apostate is in revolt against God.
He maintains an outward profession of faith and a facade of true
spirituality; but he departs from the faith. Apostasy, then, is
insidious, subtle, and quite devastating.

Some of the characteristics, or synonyms, of apostasy are mentioned in
the Bible, including: seducing spirits, doctrines of demons,
hypocritical lying, a seared conscience, forbidding of marriage and
meats, and a form of godliness without the power thereof. The rest of
this paper contains a number of points about apostasy along with an
extensive listing of Bible references for further study of the subject.

​1. Satan is the author of apostasy, JOHN 8:44, "Ye are of your father,
the devil..." and 2 COR. 4:4, "In whom the god of this world has blinded
the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious
gospel of Christ should shine unto them."

​2. Demons help to carry out apostasy in the world, 1 TIM. 4:1.

​3. Examples of apostasy in the human race mentioned in Jude are:

Cain - who rejected the Word of God and went religious.

Balaam - who accepted a bribe to curse Israel and fell victim to slavery
to the details of life.

Korah - who led a revolt against authority, was anti-establishment.

​4. Religious apostasy has many facets:

False gospels: GAL. 1:6-12; 2 COR. 11:3,4

False doctrines: 1 TIM. 4:1,2; 2 PET. 2:1; 1 JOHN 4:3

False messiahs: JOHN 5:43; MATT. 24:5

False prophets, teachers, and evangelists: 2 PET. 2:1; 1 JOHN 4:1; 2
COR. 11:13–15

False ritual: 1 COR. 10:20,21; ROM. 11:9; ISA. 1:10–14

False Gods: 1 COR. 8:5; 10:19–21

False righteousness: Phil. 3:9; Matt. 5:20

​5. Characteristics of apostate doctrines:

They repudiate the Person and work of Christ, 2 PET. 2:1; 1 JOHN
2:22,23; 2 JOHN 9,10

They repudiate the veracity of the Word of God, 2 PET. 3:3,4

They ignore the judgments of God, 2 PET. 3:5,6

​6. Apostasy appeals to the trends of the sin nature; the trend toward
asceticism, 1 TIM. 4:1–3, and the trend toward licentiousness, 2 PET. 2

​7. Apostasy is judged by God:

Angels were judged for their apostasy, 2 PET. 2:4; JUDE 6.

Civilizations are judged for apostasy, 2 PET. 2:5.

Cities and national entities are judged for apostasy, 2 PET. 2:6; JUDE
7; JER. 23.

​8. Apostates are described in the Bible as:

Animals of instinct, minus doctrine and minus morality, operating on
emotional impulses and licentious desires, 2 PET. 2:12.

Fruitless trees that are twice dead; they are spiritually dead, and they
will go to the Lake of Fire, JUDE 12.

Waterless clouds, unstable, driven by the wind, 2 PET. 2:17; JUDE 12.

Vicious waves of the sea, dangerous and to be avoided, JUDE 13.

Wandering stars, living in delusion and error, JUDE 13.

​9. Apostasy is prevalent in the last days of each dispensation:

Age of the Gentiles, GEN. 11:1–9.

Age of Israel, REV. 13; 2 THESS. 2

Church Age, 2 PET. 3:3; 2 TIM. 3:1.

​11. Apostasy is prevalent in the last days of a national entity, JER.
23:9–40.

​12. There will be no apostasy during the Millennial Kingdom, REV.
20:1-3; COL. 2:15; ZECH. 13:2,3; ISA. 2:1–4; ISA. 11:9.

​13. A brief period of apostasy will follow the Millennial reign of
Christ, REV. 20:7–11.

Holy Spirit
-----------

The Bible teaches that God is one God and that there are no other gods.
The Bible also clearly distinguishes between three parts or Persons of
God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, known as the Trinity.

This article has been prepared to organize the large number of Scripture
passages referring to the Spirit of God to show (1) that the Holy Spirit
is distinctly a Person, that is, that He has personality; (2) that He is
God, that is, that He shares all of God’s eternal attributes; and (3)
that He has an objective, real ministry in the world during the Church
Age, particularly in the lives of Christians.

**THE HOLY SPIRIT’S PERSONALITY**

The Holy Spirit has personality because He possesses the essential
characteristics of personality, namely, intellect, emotion, and will.

-   **His Intellect**, 1 Cor. 2:10,11, For to us God revealed them
    through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the
    depths of God.

-   For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of
    the man, which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows
    except the Spirit of God.

-   **His Emotion**, Eph. 4:30, And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of
    God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

-   **His Will**, 1 Cor. 12:11, But one and the same Spirit works all
    these things, distributing to each one individually just as He
    wills.

**HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE FATHER**

-   Matt. 3:16, And after being baptized, Jesus went up immediately from
    the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the
    Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon Him,

-   Luke 4:18, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me ...

-   Isaiah 61:1

**HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE SON**

-   Rom. 8:9, However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if
    indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have
    the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.

-   Phil. 1:19, For I know that this shall turn out for my deliverance
    through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus
    Christ,

**THE HOLY SPIRIT SHARES THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD**

-   **Eternity**, Heb. 9:14, how much more will the blood of Christ, who
    through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God,
    cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

-   **Life**, Rom. 8:2, For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
    Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.

-   **Holiness**, Rom. 1:4, who was declared the Son of God with power
    by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of
    holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord,

-   **Truth**, John 14:17, that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world
    cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him, but you
    know Him because He abides with you, and will be in you.

-   **Omnipotence**, Gen. 1:1,2, In the beginning God created the
    heavens and the earth.

-   And the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the
    surface of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the
    surface of the waters.

-   **Omnipresence**, Ps. 139:7-10, Where can I go from Thy Spirit? Or
    where can I flee from Thy presence?

-   If I ascend to heaven, Thou art there; If I make my bed in Sheol,
    behold, Thou art there.

-   If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest part of
    the sea,

-   Even there Thy hand will lead me, And Thy right hand will lay hold
    of me.

**THE HOLY SPIRIT REVEALS DIVINE TRUTH**

-   1 Cor. 2:9-11, but just as it is written, " Things which eye has not
    seen and ear has not heard, And which have not entered the heart of
    man, All that God has prepared for those who love Him."

-   For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit
    searches all things, even the depths of God.

-   For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of
    the man, which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows
    except the Spirit of God.

-   See also 2 Sam. 23:2; Micah 3:8; Acts 1:16; Heb. 9:6-8; 2 Pet.
    1:15-21; John 16:12-14.

**THE HOLY SPIRIT GLORIFIES THE LORD JESUS CHRIST DURING THE CHURCH
AGE**

After the Lord Jesus had ascended to Heaven, the Holy Spirit came to
indwell all believers during the Church Age.

-   John 7:38,39, "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From
    his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.'"

-   But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were
    to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
    yet glorified.

The purpose of the indwelling Holy Spirit is *not* to glorify the Holy
spirit, but to glorify Christ while He is absent from the earth.

-   John 16:13,14, "But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will
    guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own
    initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will
    disclose to you what is to come.

-   "He shall glorify Me; for He shall take of Mine, and shall disclose
    it to you.

The believer’s body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and this
glorification occurs on the inside of the believer.

-   1 Cor. 6:19,20 Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the
    Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are
    not your own?

-   For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
    body.

When a Christian is filled with the Holy Spirit (walking in fellowship),
his life is written by the Holy Spirit. He is declared to be the
epistles of Christ written by the Holy spirit.

-   2 Cor. 3:2-6 You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and
    read by all men;

-   being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us,
    written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on
    tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.

-   And such confidence we have through Christ toward God.

-   Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming
    from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,

-   who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the
    letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit
    gives life.

When a Christian is filled with the Holy Spirit, Christ is at home in
the body.

-   Eph. 3:16,17 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His
    glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner
    man;

-   so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you,
    being rooted and grounded in love,

**GENERAL WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT**

Zech. 4:6, "... not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the
Lord of hosts."

The following is a list of activities carried out by the Holy Spirit:

-   Casting out demons: Matt. 12:28

-   Comforting of believers: John 15:26

-   Reproving the world of sin: John 16:8

-   Making believers spiritually alive: Rom. 8:11

-   Making intercession for believers: Rom. 8:26

-   Making able ministers of the new covenant: 2 Cor. 3:6

-   Raising Christ from the dead: 1 Pet. 3:18

-   Was executor of Bible inspiration: 2 Pet. 1:21

-   Invites unbelievers to accept Christ: Rev. 22:17

**THE INDWELLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT**

-   The Holy Spirit lives permanently in every Christian. Rom. 8:9; Gal.
    3:2; 4:6; 1 Cor. 6:19,20.

-   The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is called the “unction” in 1 John
    2:20, and “anointing” in 1 John 2:27. These are synonyms for
    “indwelling.”

-   The prophecy of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is found in John
    7:37-39; John 14:16,17.

-   The indwelling of the Holy Spirit must be distinguished from the
    indwelling of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Christ indwells the believer for the purpose of fellowship, Rom. 8:10;
2 Cor. 13:5.

The Holy Spirit indwells the believer for the purpose of function, Gal.
5:22.

Maximum fellowship with Christ comes through the function of the Holy
Spirit in edification and grace living.

-   The indwelling of the Holy Spirit must be distinguished from the
    filling of the Holy Spirit.

-   The Indwelling is automatic at salvation.

-   The Filling is a function of the believer’s volition and may be lost
    through carnality, Eph. 4:30. The Filling is commanded, Eph. 5:18.
    The Filling is regained through confession of Sin, 1 John 1:9; Prov.
    1:23.

-   The Holy Spirits functions in the intake and application of Bible
    truth, John 14:26; 16:12-15; 1 Cor. 2:9-16; 1 John 2:27. This is the
    “how to” of edification.

The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is necessary because of the spiritual
conflict in “high places” (spiritual warfare), John 7:37-39.

**THE SEALING MINISTRY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT**

The sealing work of the Holy Spirit is the basis for our eternal
security. The three phases of salvation are given in Eph. 1:13.

-   Eph. 1:13,14 In Him, you also, after listening to the message of
    truth, the gospel of your salvation-- having also believed, you were
    sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,

-   who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the
    redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory.

-   First, you must hear the word of truth, the gospel.

-   Then, you must believe the gospel.

-   At that point, you are sealed by the Holy Spirit

-   **you were sealed** is the aorist passive indicative form of the
    verb  (**sphragidz****o)**, which means “stamped with a
    seal.”

-   In the ancient world, the seal was a guarantee or a transaction,
    e.g., a signet impression on a ring. Sealing was used to
    authenticate contracts, laws, invoices, military orders. The seal
    was also used in the ratification of treaties.

-   Seals were used to preserve tombs, libraries, treasuries. The seal
    was backed up by the force of the government in charge, e.g., the
    seal on the tomb of Christ was guaranteed by the Roman troops.

-   Seals indicate ownership; God owns the believer, having purchased
    him from the slave market of sin (Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 6:20)

-   The believer is sealed as a guarantee of his eternal security.

**THE FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT**

When a person accepts Christ as Savior, the Holy Spirit comes into
(indwells) his life permanently. The Holy Spirit indwells for the
purpose of glorifying Christ, but indwelling alone does not guarantee
that Christ will be glorified by the believer's life. For this reason,
Christians are commanded to be habitually "filled" with the Holy Spirit.

-   Eph. 5:18, And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation,
    but be filled with the Spirit,

The verb "be filled" means "to fill up a deficiency; to fully possess;
to fully influence; to fill with a certain quality." Here it is in the
present passive imperative, so the verb is a command meaning "keep on
being filled" with the believer *receiving* the action of the verb. The
filling is by means of the Holy Spirit.

The responsibility of the Christian is to confess his sins. At any point
in our lives we can take ourselves out of fellowship through personal
sin. When that happens, we become carnal, not spiritual. Sin grieves the
Holy Spirit and causes a breach in our relationship with God. But the
Lord promises that if we confess our sins, He will forgive us and
cleanse us from unrighteousness. That is, upon the condition of our
confession, He will heal the breach that sin has caused.

So, to be filled with the Holy Spirit, sin must be confessed. 1 John 1:9

See TOPIC: Confession of Sin

Nothing good is produced in the Christian's life apart from the filling
of the Holy Spirit.

-   Rom. 8:8,9 and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

-   However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the
    Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit
    of Christ, he does not belong to Him.

-   Gal. 3:3 Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now
    being perfected by the flesh?

**Results of the Filling of the Holy Spirit**

-   Imitation of Christ: John 16:14; 2 Cor. 3:3; Phil. 1:20

-   Perception of the Word: John 14:26; 16:12-14; 1 Cor. 2:9-16

-   Witnessing: Acts 1:8; 2 Cor. 3:1-10

-   Guidance: Rom. 8:14; Eph. 5:16-18

-   Assurance: Rom. 8:14-16; Gal. 4:5,6

-   Worship: Phil. 3:3; John 4:24

-   Prayer: Eph. 6:18 with Psalm 66:18

-   Leadership in Ministry: John 16:13; Acts 10:9,10; Acts 13:2; Acts
    16:6

**THE HOLY SPIRIT PROVIDES SPIRITUAL POWER**

The book of Acts is the book of spiritual power - where it comes from,
how it is obtained, and how it is used. The promise of Jesus Christ to
his disciples was "He shall give you another Comforter, that he may
abide with you forever, even the Spirit of Truth... He dwells with you
and shall be in you."

The prophesy of John the Baptist in Matt. 3:11 regarding the coming
ministry of the Lord Jesus also announced the ministry of the Holy
Spirit for the Church Age.

-   Matt. 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he
    that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy
    to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:"

Examples of believers receiving the Holy Spirit:

-   At Pentecost: Acts 2:3

-   The Samaritan Christians: Acts 8:17

-   Cornelius and his company: Acts. 10:44

-   The Ephesian believers: Acts 19:6,7

**The Benefits Derived from Spiritual Power**

-   Men receive courage to rebuke sin: Matt. 3:8

-   Men are enabled to speak with confidence: Acts 4:31-33\*

-   Gives spiritual and moral strength: 2 Sam. 22:40; Isa. 28:56; Isa.
    40:31; 41:10; Dan. 11:32; Eph. 3:16

-   Provides strength in weakness: 1 Cor. 1:27; 2 Cor. 12:9; 13:4

-   Provides spiritual gifts: Rom. 12:6; Eph. 4:11

**THE FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT**

The fruit of the Holy Spirit is the character of Christ being formed in
the Christian who is filled with the Spirit. Gal. 5:22,23 has a listing
of the types of production which are the result of the fruit of the
Spirit.

Love, Joy, and Peace are fruits of mental attitude, inward thinking that
reflects the lack of mental attitude sins and the relaxation which comes
from knowing Bible truth.

Long-suffering, Gentleness, and Goodness are outward, or directed toward
"neighbors."

Long-suffering, for example, is a relaxed attitude toward the human race
and is a result of having love, joy peace. This is Faith-Rest under
pressure which comes from people or Circumstances.

Faith, Meekness, and Temperance are fruits directed upward, or God-ward.

Humility, for example, is a grace attitude with regard to divine
provision that gives glory to God for all support and blessing in life,
rather than taking the attitude that one is self-made.

**Conditions of Fruit-Bearing**

The following are required in order for a Christian to have spiritual
fruit:

-   Contact with the Living Water: Ps. 1:3; Eze. 47:12

-   Spiritual receptivity: Matt. 13:23

-   Death of the old life: John 12:24

-   Chastening (pruning): John 15:2

-   Abiding in Christ: John 15:4

**SINS AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT**

The Bible speaks of five types of sin which can be committed against the
Holy Spirit. Two are committed by unbelievers only; the other three are
committed by Christians.

**Sins By Unbelievers Only**

-   Resistance of the Holy Spirit: Acts 7:51. This is rejection of the
    Lord Jesus Christ and a rejection of the pre-salvation ministry of
    the Holy Spirit (John 16:7-11) through the sin of unbelief

-   Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit: Matt. 12:31,32. This refers to
    rejection of Jesus Christ during His ministry on earth (during the
    previous dispensation, the Age of the Jews).

-   **Sins by Believers**

-   Lying to the Holy Spirit: Acts 5:3. Refers to false motivation,
    approbation lust sin.

-   Grieving the Holy Spirit: Eph. 4:30. Refers to producing sins from
    the area of weakness in the sin nature. Any sin in the life of the
    believer which involves a moral or ethical issue.

-   Quenching the Holy Spirit: 1 Thess. 5:19. Producing human good from
    the areas of strength in the Sin Nature. Examples: giving, prayer,
    witnessing for the purpose of gaining approbation. Human good
    soothes the conscience and keeps the believer from confessing his
    sin.




Hope
----

Hope is the mental attitude of confidence that results from learning and
applying Bible truth regarding the future.

In Bible usage, "hope" (Greek: ELPI\~) is synonymous with "confidence".
Growth in confidence comes along with growth in Christ. Applied
knowledge of Bible principles of time and eternity leads to supreme
confidence in God's Word.

The Christian has confidence in

an eternal inheritance, 1 Pet. 1:4,5

the new home in the future, John 14:1-3

the resurrection body, 1 Cor. 15:51-57

See also 1 Th. 4:16-18; Phil. 3:21; and 1 John 3:1,2.

The hope of Israel is in their coming Messiah (the Second Coming of
Christ, His kingdom on earth, and the new earth of eternity.

Luke 1:67-79; 2:28-32; Acts 26:6,7; 28:20; Eph. 2:12.

The Abrahamic Covenant (amplified by the Palestinian, Davidic, and New
Covenant\~) promised to Israel the land of Canaan, the eternal seed (the
Messiah), and blessing (new birth). Israel's hope lies in these promises
of God.

Abraham's hope was directed to the promise of a new city, the New
Jerusalem, Heb. 11:9,10.

The hope for the Church is the "blessed hope" of the Rapture. Titus
2:13-15; 1 John 3:2,3; 1 Thess. 4:13-18

Hope is derived from such passages as Rev. 2:14 in which it is stated
that there will be no more death, tears, pain, etc.

The hope (confidence) we have in Christ has caused death to lose its
sting and the grave to lose its victory. 1 Cor. 15:54-58.

The word hopeless should never be in the Christian's vocabulary.

Imputation
----------

Imputation is a wonderful principle of the Plan of God, and you have
been involved with imputation since the day you were saved.

To impute means “to set something to one’s account.”

In the Bible imputation is used as a legal term in several different
ways. For example, when Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon, he told
Philemon that if Onesimus had incurred any debts they were to be put on
Paul’s account (Philemon 17,18).

When a groom says to a bride “with all my worldly good I thee endow”, he
is talking about imputation, placing to the bride’s account all of his
property.

The Greek verb for imputation is logidzomai. It is used more than 40
times in the New Testament, ten times in Romans 4 alone, the imputation
chapter. In the KVJ of Romans 4 it’s translated “counted” in 4:3,5,
“reckoned” in 4:4,10, and “imputed” in 4:6,8,11,22,23,24.

Three Imputations in the Bible

In the first type of imputation, God imputes to us what actually belongs
to us in the first place. Where Romans 5:12 says that “death passed upon
(logidzomai) all men, for that all have sinned”, death is part of our
spiritual heritage from Adam. Death has been reckoned to our account.
Adam’s sins was not his alone, but it was placed on every person’s
account, on the debit side, you might say.

In the second type of imputation, God the Father imputes to the Lord
Jesus Christ that which does not belong to him. 2 Cor. 5:21 says that
“he (Christ) was made to be (logidzomai) sin for us, even though he knew
no sin...”. This is the Bible concept of substitution; Christ died for
our sins, not his own. Isaiah 53:4-6. The verse does not say that Christ
became a sinner, but that sin was set to his account that was not his.

The third type of imputation occurs when God imputes (credit\~) to the
sinner what is not actually his. Again, 2 Cor. 5:21, “that we might be
made the righteousness of God in him.” Here, the actual perfect
righteousness of God is credited to us. This righteousness, which is
placed on the credit side of our ledger, is known as imputed
righteousness or justification.

God declares men to be righteous on the basis of faith. Read Romans 4:3.
“Abraham believed God and it was counted to him (logidzomai) for
righteousness”. God makes men righteous on the basis of practice by the
Word (John 17:17) and the filling of the Holy Spirit. (See Topic:
Sanctification)

logidzomai from the Lexicons

A study of various Greek lexicons shows that logidzomai has some very
interesting uses in the Bible. If you will study each of these verses in
the context, it will help you to understand the concept better, and you
will find a lot of practical application for this doctrine. Here is a
list of three principal meanings for logidzomai in the Bible and in
other sources of New Testament Greek studies.

To reckon; to calculate

The word means “to count, to take something into account” in 1 Cor. 13:5
(cf. Zech. 8:17); 2 Cor. 5:19; Rom. 4:8 (cf. Ps. 32:2); and 2 Tim. 4:16.

It is used in Romans 4:4, 4:6; and 4:11 in the sense of “crediting.”

It means “to credit something to someone” in Romans 4:3,5,9,22; Gal.
3:16; James 2:23 (cf. Romans 4:10,23ff; Gen. 15:6; Ps. 106:31).

In the commercial world of New Testament times, logidzomai was a
technical term “to charge to someone’s account” and was so used in 2
Cor. 12:6. (Other references: 0rientis Graeci Inscriptiones Selectae,
edited by Dittenberger, 1903; and Fayum Towns and Their Papyri, by
Grenfell, Hunt, et al.)

The idea of calculation is seen in other places in the concepts of “to
evaluate, to estimate, to consider, to look upon as, something, as a
result of calculation”. You will see this in Acts 19:27 (cf. Isa. 40:17)
and Rom. 9:8; 2:26.

The word is used in the sense of “to count” or “to classify”. In Greek
Papyri in the British Museum, Kenyon and Bell said of a camel’s colt:
“which is now classed among the full grown.” In the Bible, see Mark
15:28; Luke 22:37 (cf. Isa. 53:12).

Still under the idea of reckoning or calculation, logidzomai means “to
consider; to look upon someone as”, as in 1 Cor. 4:1; 2 Cor. 10:2; Rom.
8:36 (cf. Ps. 44:22); Rom. 6:11.

Think about; ponder; consider; let one’s mind dwell on.

This is the word logidzomai used in the sense of one’s mental
preparation for the act of “reckoning” or “imputing” something to
someone’s account or credit. It means “to have in mind, to propose, to
purpose”. See Phil. 4:8; John 11:50; Heb. 11:19; 2 Cor. 10:2,11.

It is used as “to think; to believe; to be of the opinion” in Rom. 2:3;
3:28; 8:18; 14:14; Phil. 3:13; 2 Cor. 11:5; and 1 Pet. 5:12.

Words from the Papyri

Oxyrynchus Papyri XII, “the due amounts in money and corn are reckoned
here” (107 or 108 AD)

ibid III, “let my revenues be placed on deposit at the storehouse” (2nd
or 3rd Century AD)

Florentine Papyri (AD 254), “reckoning the wine to him at sixteen
drachmae...”

and Milligan studies in the papyri.

Jewish Religious System
-----------------------

The religious life of the Jews in the time of Christ was controlled by
the members of the Jewish priesthood, composed of the high priest and
his family, the members of the supreme council, the Sanhedrin, and the
local priest, or rabbi, who presided over the synagogue. Among the
religious leaders there were many factions; and these factions had grave
and fundamental differences in doctrine and practice.

This paper contains a description of each of the main elements of the
Jewish religious hierarchy, namely: the Scribes, the Pharisees, the
Sadducees, and the Sanhedrin. There is also a discussion of the
doctrinal differences between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and there is
a description of the Jewish Talmud, which comprised the written and oral
scriptures and traditions of the Jews.

**The Scribes**

In New Testament times the Scribes formed a small and exclusive class,
holding absolute spiritual supremacy over the people. Everywhere you
would see the Scribe as the mouthpiece and representative of the people;
he pushes to the front, the crowd respectfully giving way and eagerly
listening to his statements as those of a recognized authority. The
great respect paid to Scribes is reflected in the title of honor "my
master", in Hebrew **rabbi**. From this respectful address the title
Rabbi was formed, probably beginning as such in the time of Christ. In
John 3, Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee, addressed Christ as "rabbi", a
form of respect for a recognized teacher.

In New Testament Greek the words **nomikos**, "learned in the law;
jurist" (Matt. 22:35; Luke 7:30; 10:25; 11:45,52; 14:3), and
**nomodidaskalos**, "teacher of the law" (Luke 5:17; Acts 5:34) are
used.

The period of the Sopherim, Scribes, began officially with the return of
the Jews from captivity. Ezra was both a priest and a scribe; and the
law read by Ezra (Neh. 8-10) was the Pentateuch essentially as we have
it now. And from that time the Pentateuch was acknowledged by Jews as
the binding rule of life. The office of scribe had its origin somewhat
earlier than this official beginning, however.

The scribe of the Greek state (**grammateus)** was more than a mere
writer; he was also the keeper and registrar of public documents (acc.
to Thucydides, iv. 118; vii, 10; and also in Acts 19:35). Three men are
mentioned as holding the office of scribe under Kings David and Solomon
(2 Sam. 8:17; 20:25; 1 Kings 4:3). These were the king's secretaries,
writing his letters, drawing up orders and decrees, and managing royal
finances. At a later period, the word "scribe" is connected with the
numbering of the military forces of the country (Jer. 52:25; Isa.
33:18).

King Hezekiah brought together a group of men whose work it was to
transcribe old records and to put in writing what had been handed down
orally (Prov. 25:1). So the new significance of the title “Scribe”
probably dates to this time, no longer referring only to an officer of
the king's court, but to a class of students and interpreters of the
law, boasting in their wisdom (Jer. 8:8).

The Law had been handed to Moses by God at Mt. Sinai, and the writings
of Moses, the Pentateuch, was the chief body of Scripture for the Jews
after the exile. Very quickly, however, the inspired writings of the
prophets and historians were added to the authoritative canon of
scripture. At a still later period, a third collection of writings was
begun which over many generations became for the Jews just as
authoritative as the inspired writings. This body of work was the
writings of the Scribes of decisions and interpretations of the
Pentateuch, prophetical, and historical writings.

As the law became more complicated and comprehensive, more scientific
study and professional interpretation was required. The many details and
applications to everyday life involved patient study. In the time of
Ezra, and for several generations thereafter, this study and teaching
was the job of the priesthood. But the higher the law rose in the
estimation of the people, the more its study and exposition become an
independent activity. Thus the scholar class, the Scribes, was formed.

The priests had somewhat abdicated their God-given position as teachers
of the congregation of Israel because, under Greek influence, the higher
strata of priests, applied themselves to the study of heathen cultures,
and more or less neglected the law. The Scribes appeared as the zealous
and single-minded guardians of the law, and became the real teachers of
the people, over whose lives they had control.

The history of the Scribes is divided into five periods, indicated by
the names given to Scribes during successive times:

The Sopherim (see above): lasting from the return from Babylon and
ending with the death of Simon the Just, from about 458 to 300 B.C.

The Tanaim (repeaters, or teachers of the law): in New Testament times.

The Amoraim (Heb. the expounders) "wise men" and "doctors" of the law,
who alone constituted the authorized recorders and expositors of the
Halachah (220A.D. to the completion of the Babylonian Talmud, About 500
A.D.) See below regarding the Halachah.

The Saboraim (from Heb. to think or to discern): teachers of the law
after the conclusion of the Talmud, 500 to 657 A.D., who determined the
law from a careful examination of all the considerations urged by the
Amoraim in their controversies on divine, legal, and ritual questions
contained in the Talmud.

The Gaonim, the last doctors of the law in the rabbinic succession, from
657 A.D. to 1034.

**The Employment of the Scribes**

In the time of Christ, the rabbis required from their students absolute
respect, even greater than the honor due to parents. "If a man's father
and teacher have lost anything, the teacher's loss should have the
precedence, i.e., he must first be assisted in recovering it; the burden
of a teacher is to be born in preference to that of a father, a teacher
must be ransomed from captivity before one's own father." The rabbis in
general everywhere claimed the first rank (Matt. 23:6,7; Mark 12:38;
Luke 11:43; 20:46).

The main task of the Scribes was the theoretical development of the law.
They developed the general precepts of the law; and where the written
law made no direct provision, they created an application, either by
establishing a precedent that was followed thereafter, or by inference
from previous legal decisions. In this way, up to the time of Christ,
Jewish law became an extensive and complicated science. Very great study
was needed to gain even a general acquaintance with it.

The Scribes assumed that it was their special task to improve what was
already binding by developing more and more subtle sophistication in
reasoning. To develop a system of law binding on everyone, it was
necessary to come as near to a consensus as possible. So the whole
process of systematizing the law was carried on by oral discussion, the
acknowledged authorities instructing the students and debating legal
questions with each other, for centuries.

This made it necessary that the chief among the Scribes live in certain
central places, and until 70 A.D. Jerusalem was the main headquarters of
the Scribes, after that at Jamnia and Tiberias. Gradually, the theories
of the Scribes became valid law; the rules developed by them were
recognized in practice as soon as the various schools were in agreement.
The Scribes were, in fact, legislators, especially after the destruction
of the Temple, for then there was no civil court of justice under the
Sanhedrin (see below).

The second task of the scribes was teaching the law. Every Israelite was
supposed to have a thorough knowledge of the law. As a consequence, the
famous chief rabbis gathered about them large numbers of students.
Because parts of the oral law were never committed to writing, constant
repetition was required to make it stick in the minds of the learners.
Questions were directed to the students for the decision, while pupils
also questions the teachers. Because all knowledge of the law was
strictly traditional, the student had only two duties - to keep
everything in memory, and to teach only what had been given to him.

There were special locations for this instruction, "houses of teaching"
(synagogues), and the Temple itself among the colonnades or other spaces
in the outer court (Matt. 21:23; 26:55; Mark 14:49; Luke 2:46; 20:37;
John 18:20).

The third duty of Scribes was to pass sentence in the court of justice.
Obviously, men so well versed in the law would be asked to be judges. We
know that scribes were members of the Sanhedrin (see below). After the
fall of the Jewish state in 70 A.D., scribes were both legislators and
judges.

**The Writings of the Scribes**

In the development and writing of the law there evolved two main bodies
of written work, the Halachah and the Haggadah.

Edersheim, in *Life and Times of Jesus*, Vol. I, p.98, states that the
Halachah contained "either simply the laws laid down in Scripture, or
else derived from or traced to it by some ingenious and artificial
method of exegesis; or added to it, by way of amplification and for
safety's sake; or, finally, legalized customs. They provided for every
possible and impossible case, entered into every detail of private,
family, and public life; and with iron logic, unbending rigor, and most
minute analysis pursued and dominated man, turn whither he might, laying
on him a yoke which was truly unbearable. The return which it offered
was the pleasure and distinction of knowledge, the acquisition of
righteousness, and the final attainment of rewards."

Scheurer, in *Jewish People*, Div. II, Vol I, pp. 339 ff, states that
the Haggadah "is an amplification and remodeling of what was originally
given, according to the views and necessities of later times. It is true
that here also the given text forms the point of departure, and that a
similar treatment to that employed in passages from the law takes place
in the first instance. The history is worked up by combining the
different statements in the text with each other, completing one by
another, setting the chronology, etc. Or the religious and ethical parts
are manipulated by formulating dogmatic propositions from isolated
prophetic utterances, by bringing these into relation to each other, and
thus obtaining a kind of dogmatic system. "

**The Pharisees**

The word "Pharisee" is from Greek by way of the Aramaic word for
"separated". The name Separatist is thought by some to be derived from
that separation which took place in the time of Zerubbabel, and then
again in the time of Ezra, when Israel separated from the heathen
dwelling in the land and from their uncleanness (Ezra 6:21; 9:1; 10:11;
Neh. 9:2; 10:29).

However, the name probably has a stricter meaning, coming to the
Pharisees as a result of their extremely strict view of the idea of
pollution, not only from the uncleanness of the heathen, but also from
that pollution with which they thought the majority of Israelites were
likewise affected. They might have been called "separatists" by some in
praise, and by others in blame. It is unlikely that they took the name
for themselves because they called themselves the haberim, those who
"associate", this term referring to one who associates himself with the
law in order to observe it strictly in opposition to the encroachments
of the heathen world culture.

The priests and scribes (see above) formed the inner structure of Jewish
religion after the captivity. These two groups became more and more
separated until, in the Maccabaean period, two parties, sharply at odds
with each other, were developed from them, the Pharisees from the
Scribes, and the Sadducees from the ranks of the priests (see below).
The characteristic feature of the Pharisees arose from the legal
tendency, while that of the Sadducees came from the social position.

During the Greek period, the chief priests and rulers of the people took
an increasingly more negative attitude toward the law; so the Pharisees
united themselves more tightly into a group that kept to a strict
observance of the law. In the time of John Hyrcanus, they were in
hostile opposition to the Maccabees, because the Maccabees chief
objective was no longer the carrying out the law but maintaining and
extending political and economic power.

The stress which the Pharisees laid on the religion of the people won
the majority of the nation to their side, and Queen Alexandra, to keep
civil peace, gave the power into the Pharisees' hands. It was
consistency with principle which gave them spiritual supremacy and kept
people on their side. Although the Sadducees were at the head of the
Sanhedrin, the whole conduct of internal affairs was in Pharisee hands;
they completely ruled the public life of the nation, and this continued
essentially throughout the time of Christ and the apostles.

From Scheurer, *Jewish People*, Div. II, Vol. II, p. 28, "They had the
bulk of the nation as their ally, and women especially were in their
control. They had the greatest influence upon the congregations, so that
all acts of public worship, prayers, and sacrifices were performed
according to their injunctions. Their sway over the masses was so
absolute that they could obtain a hearing even when they said anything
against the king or the high priest; consequently, they were the most
capable of counteracting the designs of the kings. Hence, too, the
Sadducees, in their official acts, adhered to the demands of the
Pharisees, because otherwise the multitude would not have tolerated
them."

**Teachings of the Pharisees**

Concerning immortality, the Pharisees taught "that every soul is
imperishable, but that only those of the righteous pass into another
body, while those of the wicked are punished with eternal torment"
(Josephus, Wars of the Jews, II, 8, 14). "They hold the belief that an
immortal strength belongs to souls and that there are beneath the earth
punishments and rewards for those who in life devoted themselves to
virtue or vileness, and that eternal imprisonment is appointed for the
latter, but the possibility of returning to life for the former"
(Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, XVIII, 1,3).

The Pharisees also taught the existence of angels and spirits, while the
Sadducees denied them (Acts 23:8), and this also represented the general
standpoint of later Judaism.

Concerning divine providence and human freedom, the Pharisees "make
everything depend on fate and on God, and teach that the doing of good
is indeed chiefly the affair of man, but that fate also cooperates in
every transaction" (Josephus, Wars, II, 8, 14).

"They assert that everything is accomplished by faith. They do not,
however, deprive the human will of spontaneity, it having pleased God
that there should be a mixture, and that to the will of fate should be
added the human will with its virtue or baseness" (Josephus,
Antiquities, XVIII, 1,3).

Concerning politics, the standpoint of the Pharisees was looking at
civil affairs from a religious point of view. They could be content with
any government as long as religion was not hindered; but they became, in
a sense, a political party when they rose to oppose a government that
interfered with the practice of the law.

**Practices of the Pharisees**

All Israelites avoided, as far as possible, all physical contact with
the heathen, in order to avoid being defiled. The Pharisee, in addition,
avoided physical contact with any non-Pharisees, even among other Jews.
The fact that the Pharisees found fault with Jesus' contact with
publicans and sinners agreed exactly with this point of view (Mark
2:14–17; Matt. 9:9–13; Luke 5:27–32).

In the Talmud, seven kinds of Pharisees are described (from Delitzsch,
*Jesus und Hillel*):

• The Schechemite Pharisee, so-called because he keeps the law for what
he can profit from it, as Shechem submitted to circumcision to obtain
Dinah (Gen. 34:19).

The Tumbling Pharisee, who, to appear humble, hangs down his head and is
in danger of falling down.

The Bleeding Pharisee, who often meets with wounds because he walks
around with his eyes closed so as not to see a woman.

The Mortar Pharisee, who wears a cap shaped like a mortar to cover his
eyes so as not to see impurities or indecencies.

The "What-Am-I-Yet-To-Do" Pharisee, who, because he doesn't know much
about the law, says "Tell me what my duty is now, and I will do it."

The Pharisee From Fear, who keeps the law because he is afraid of future
judgment.

The Pharisee From Love, who obeys the Lord because he loves him with all
his heart.

A Comparison of Pharisaism and Christianity

It was Jesus Christ's great effort to make clear the principles of the
Laws of the Old Testament dispensation and to carry them to their
legitimate conclusions, to "fulfill the law", not to confirm the law as
many have thought. The Pharisees taught such a slavish adherence to the
letter of the law that its true character, which pointed to something
higher than its letter, was completely overwhelmed; and its moral
precepts, which were intended to elevate men, were instead made to
contract and debase the ideas of morality.

While it was the aim of Jesus to call men to the law of God itself as
the supreme guide of life, the Pharisees multiplied minute precepts and
distinctions to such an extent that the whole life of Israel was hemmed
in and burdened on every side by instructions so numerous and trifling
that the law was almost lost sight of (Matt. 12:1–13; 23:23; Mark 3:1‑6;
7:2–4; Luke 13:10–17; 18:12).

It was Christ's leading aim to teach men that true piety lay not in
outward forms, but in substance; not in small details, but in great
rules of life. The whole system of Pharisaic piety led to the exact
opposite. Under its influence "the weightier matters of the law,
judgment, mercy, and faith" (Matt. 23:23; Luke 11:42) were undervalued
and neglected. Religion in the heart was ignored (Luke 11:38–41). The
most sacred obligations were evaded (Mark 7:11). Vain and trifling
questions took the place of serious inquiry into the great principles of
duty (Matt. 19:3). Even the most solemn truths were handled as mere
matters of curious speculation or means to entrap an adversary (Matt.
22:35; Luke 17:20).

Christ taught compassion for the degraded and friendless; liberality to
the poor; holiness of heart; universal love; a mind open to the truth.
The Pharisees shunned lower classes and pushed from themselves such as
the Savior would have gathered into his arms (Luke 7:39; 15:2; 18:11;
John 7:47,48). They made a prey of the friendless (Matt. 23:13). With
all their pretence, they were really avaricious, sensual, and dissolute
(Matt. 23:25; John 8:7). They devoted their energies to making converts
to themselves (Matt. 23:15).

**The Sadducees**

The Hebrew word by which the Sadducees were called is **tsaddiqim**,
"the righteous ones". If we only look at the points of differences
between them and the Pharisees, we get a distorted picture of the
Sadducees; but each party had its strong characteristics, that of the
Pharisees being a rigid realism, while the Sadducees were aristocratic.
According to Josephus, "they gain only the well-to-do; they have not the
people on their side." The high priestly families, for example, were
almost all Sadducees.

**Beliefs of The Sadducees**

The Sadducees accepted only the written law and prophets as binding.
They rejected the entire traditional interpretations and the further
developments of the Scribes. "The Sadducees say only what is written is
to be thought of as legal...what has come down from tradition of the
fathers need not be observed." (Josephus, Antiquities, XIII, 10,6).

In legal matters the Sadducees were very rigid in judging offenders,
while the Pharisees were much milder. "They saw in the tradition of the
elders an excess of legal strictness which they refused to have imposed
upon them, while the advanced religious views were, on the one hand,
superfluous to their worldly-mindedness, and on the other, inadmissible
by their higher culture and enlightenment" (Scheurer, Jewish People,
Div. II, Vol. I, p. 41). A more thorough discussion of legal matters
among the Sadducees can be found in Unger's Bible Dictionary, pp.
952,953.

In ritual, the only important differences of Sadducees from Pharisees
was in respect to laws of cleanness. They derided the Pharisees for the
oddities and inconsistences which they had brought into their laws of
purity. They did not reject the idea of Levitical uncleanness, however,
and they demanded a higher degree of cleanness for the priest who made
the red heifer offering than did the Pharisees.

**Doctrines of the Sadducees**

The Sadducees did not believe in a resurrection of the body or in
retribution or reward in a future life. They did not feel bound by any
doctrine which did not proceed from Moses, and there was no assertion by
Moses in the Pentateuch of any resurrection from the dead. The Sadducees
would have given much more weight to Moses' writings than to any of the
prophets or historians, even though they regarded those writings
canonical.

The Sadducees denied that there were angels or spirits, independent
spiritual beings besides God. Even the soul, they said, was only refined
matter and would perish with the body.

It is not surprising that the Sadducees laid great stress on human free
will. With a strong insistence on personal liberty there came a decrease
of the religious motive. They insisted that man was at his own disposal,
and they rejected the idea that a divine cooperation takes place in
human actions. The Pharisees accentuated the divine to the verge of
fatalism, and insisted on absolute preordination of every event in its
smallest detail. The Sadducees opposed notions like these.

**The Sanhedrin**

The rise of this great council of the Hebrews took place in the time of
Greek supremacy, though there has been some attempt to trace its origins
to the council of seventy elders named by Moses. The first mention of
the Sanhedrin is in the time of Antiochus the Great (223-187 B.C.) It
was evidently an aristocratic body, with the high priest acting as
president. When the Roman order was introduced by Pompey, the high
priest still retained the position of governor of the nation, making it
likely that the Sanhedrin was carrying on.

Herod the Great began his reign by ordering the whole of the Sanhedrin
put to death, appointing his own council of elders in their place. Under
the Roman pro-curators, the internal government of the country was in
the hands of the Sanhedrin to a much greater extent. And in the time of
Christ and the apostles, the Sanhedrin is frequently mentioned as being
the supreme Jewish court of justice. The Sanhedrin was abolished after
the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.

**The Organization of the Sanhedrin**

The Sanhedrin was composed of 71 priests who served for life and who
were selected from the following:

The acting high priest presided over the council; all former high
priests were members.

Male members of the high priestly families

Scribes, legal assessors, bureaucrats

Pharisees and Sadducees

Elders - tribal and family heads

Criminal judges were members of the Sanhedrin, and twenty-three of them
sat in judgment, with two clerks to record votes for acquittal and
conviction. In capital cases, argument for acquittal was heard first,
then those in favor of conviction. Anyone who had spoken in favor of the
accused could not then speak against him; but one who had spoken against
the accused could change his testimony in his favor. Sentence for
acquittal could be pronounced immediately; but sentence for conviction
was reserved for the next day.

In voting, each member stood, beginning with the youngest. A simple
majority was sufficient for acquittal; but a majority of at least two
votes was required for conviction. More members of the Sanhedrin would
be brought in two at a time to vote whenever there was a majority of
only one for conviction. When all 71 had voted, the person was acquitted
if there was still a majority of only one.

Jesus appeared before the Sanhedrin on a charge of blasphemy (Matt.
26:65; John 19:7). Peter and John were charged with being false prophets
and deceivers of the people (Acts 4 and 5), Stephen with being a
blasphemer (Acts 6:13 ff), and Paul with being guilty of transgressing
the Mosaic law (Acts 23).

The Sanhedrin had the right of ordering arrests by its own officers; of
finally disposing of such cases as did not involve capital punishment. A
sentence of death had to be ratified by the Roman procurator.

**The Talmud**

Extracts from “The Essential Talmud,” by Adin Steinsaltz.

The Bible is the chief cornerstone of the Jewish religion, and the
Talmud is the central pillar. It is the most important book in Jewish
culture and is the backbone of creativity and national life, shaping
spiritual content and serving as a guide to conduct.

In a formal definition, the Talmud is “the summary of oral law that
evolved after centuries of scholarly effort by sages who lived in
Palestine and Babylonia until the beginning of the Middle Ages.” The
Talmud has two main components: the Mishnah, a book of law
(**halakhah**), written in Hebrew; and the commentary on the Mishnah,
known as the Gemara, a summary of the discussions and explanations of
the Mishnah, written in Aramaic.

The Talmud is the repository of thousands of years of Jewish wisdom, and
the oral law, “which is as ancient and significant as the written law
(the Torah),” finds expression therein. It is a collection of law,
legend, and philosophy, a blend of logic and shrewd pragmatism, of
history and science, anecdotes and humor. Is it a collection of
paradoxes; its framework is orderly and logical, every word and term is
subjected to meticulous editing, completed centuries after the actual
work of composition cane to an end; yet it is still based on **free
association**, a harnessing together of diverse ideas, reminiscent of
the modern stream-of-consciousness novel.

Here is a comment from Rabbi Steinsaltz’s book, Chapter 15, **The
Sabbath**: “In the most general sense, the numerous Sabbath laws are an
expanding network of minute details deriving from several basic
concepts, which eventually create an almost Gothic structure made up of
thousands upon thousands of tiny and meticulously fashioned details
clustered around the original form.

Judgment, Justice, and Judging
------------------------------

The Bible says that God is just. We know that He exercises perfect
judgment and discernment in His dealings with mankind. This study
discusses the various Bible passages dealing with the subjects of
judgment and justice and gives the Christian believer a basis for
knowing the difference between sinful judging and spiritual discernment
in human affairs.

God is the Only Capable Judge of Mankind

Romans 2:1-16

The general purpose of Rom. 1:18 to 3:20 is not to prove that all men
are sinners -- this is taken for granted. It is, rather, to make starkly
clear the certainty of God's judgment on unrighteousness, which is the
terrible consequence of sin.

In chapter 1, the Gentiles were not actually referred to, although they
were probably in the picture in the minds of some readers, particularly
the Jews. In fact, some people, including especially the Jews, would not
have regarded themselves as in the category of immoral persons. Yet
these very people, in their self-righteousness, were in equal need of
conviction of sin.

This conviction of sin is found in chapter 2, with the individual being
addressed as "thou", as opposed to the "they" of chapter 1.

The self-righteous person does not consider himself as being subject to
condemnation; and it is not easy to convince him of sin. His
self-righteousness and moral trends are so strong that he does not feel
the need of the Gospel of Christ.

If the immoral man of chapter 1 is "holding down" or "hindering" the
truth by sinning, the respectable man of chapter 2 is "proclaiming the
truth in unrighteousness" by judging. Spiritual pride is a great
stumblingblock. Chapter 2, verses 1 to 16, is arranged as follows:

​1. The Rebuke -- (2:1) The Apostle appeals to the S/R person's
conscience. If the man assents to the condemnation of sinners, he really
condemns himself. The man must have his arrogance removed; God has one
standard for all. Judging others will not bring escape from God's
judgment.

​2. The First Principle of Judgment -- (2:2) The judgment of God is
"according to truth", therefore impartial.

​3. The Impossibility of Escape -- (2:3-5) The Jew will not be able to
claim any exemption because of his national heritage or religion. No
human righteousness provides for escape from judgment.

In human jurisdictions, a guilty person may get away with a crime if (1)
his offence is not known; (2) he escapes beyond the bounds of the
jurisdiction; (3) there is some failure in the legal process after his
arrest; or, (4) he escapes from custody and hides from officers of the
law. Of course, none of these will help a person escape from divine
justice.

​4. The Second Principle of Judgment -- (2:6) God's dealings with
mankind are based on absolute justice, whether as to punishment or
reward. "Who will render to every man according to his deeds." cf. Prov.
24:12

​5. The Reality of Meaning -- (2:7-10) There is no middle ground. Only
two sorts of deeds are allowed. People are either on one side or the
other.

​6. The Third Principle of Judgment -- (2:11) "There is no respect of
persons with God." God has no favorites. The Jews' being chosen did not
mean that they had immunity from judgment.

​7. Universal Application of Judgment -- (2:12-15) Standards of judgment
will be different between Jew and Gentile, the Jews being judged by the
Law of Moses, and the Gentile being judged by the law of conscience.
Thus, character will be the test in both cases.

​8. The Fourth Principle of Judgment -- (2:16) Both Jews and Gentiles
will be brought face to face with Christ and the Gospel in the ultimate
judgment. "In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men according
to my Gospel by Jesus Christ."

The Justice of God

God has sovereignty over His creatures by virtue of His creation. He has
the perfect right to dispose of His works as it may please Him. Psalm
115:3; 135:6

God is a judge. Psalm 50:6. As a judge, He places a penalty on sin. Rom.
6:23, "The wages of sin is death." God demands that disobedience against
His laws be punished, Deut. 18:18-19.

God is perfect in Justice.

Isa. 45:20-25; Ps. 89:13-16

God's Justice is impartial.

II Chr. 19:4-11

Rom. 3:26, "To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he
might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."

God's Justice is satisfied because of God's provision: Jesus Christ paid
the penalty.

Col. 2:13-15

The Person and Work of the Lord Jesus Christ satisfied the just demands
of God's Righteousness and Justice.

II Cor. 5:21; Isa. 53:10-11

Therefore, God is Just when He forgives the person who accepts the Work
of Jesus Christ.

Rom. 8:1, "There is therefore now no condemnation..."

I John 5:11,12 "And this is the record, that God hath given to us
eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath
life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."

Principle : Grace always precedes judgment. cf. Mal. 1,2

Judging

There are several words in the Bible referring to various types of
discernment, judgment, and condemnation. Sometimes we are warned not to
engage in sinful judging of others. At other times we are told to
exercise godly judgment (discernment) in deciding a matter. In almost
every passage dealing with judging, the context will enable you decide
which type of judging is being discussed.

For clarity in our teaching, we often use the word judging to refer to
improper, destructive criticism, either by a believer out of fellowship,
or by an unbeliever under certain conditions. We use the word
discernment for the proper evaluation of people, events, or problems, by
believers under the control of the Holy Spirit.

USES OF (krino)

The basic Greek word for the verb "to judge" is krino. This word is used
for both legitimate discernment and for sinful judging. This word has
the following uses :

"To select, to prefer":

Rom. 14:5 "One man esteems (krino) one day above another: another
esteems every day alike. Let everyman be fully persuaded in his own
mind."

This is legitimate discernment.

"To judge": "I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say." I Cor. 10:15
Used in the right sense of discernment.

"To reach a decision": "...hath so decreed..." I Cor. 7:37. The right
sense.

"To hold court" (used as a legal term)

I Cor. 5:12, "For what have I to do to judge thee also that are without?
(the unbeliever\~) Do not ye judge them that are within (believers in
local church)?" Paul or a congregation have the right to hold court. In
regard to believers this is legitimate.

Acts 25:10, "...where I ought to be judged." Paul is before the Roman
Court where it is legitimate for cases to be judged.

"Settling a dispute or quarrel":

1 Cor. 6:6, "But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the
unbelievers..."

Here, krino is translated "to go to law", which, in itself, is
legitimate. But between two church members it is not right in these
circumstances.

Divine Court :

2 Tim. 4:1, "...Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His
appearing and His kingdom."

"To pass judgment upon, thus to express an opinion":

Matt. 7:1,2, "Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment
ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be
measured to you again." This kind of judgment is sinful judging carried
on by a believer out of fellowship.

John 7:24, "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous
judgement." This is an excellent illustration of the Lord teaching that
sinful judging is to be replaced by discernment based on spiritual
information.

"To pass unfavorable judgment upon, to criticize, to find fault with, to
condemn":

Romans 2:1, "Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art
that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself,
for thou that judgest doest the same things." This is either a mental
attitude sin, a sin of the tongue, or both.

Romans 14:3, "Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and
let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath
received him." In other words, mind your own business.

Romans 14:10, "But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set
at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat
of Christ." Delegate all judging to the Lord.

Romans 14:13, "Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but
judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to
fall in his brother's way." Here krinw is used both in the bad sense and
in the good sense.

I Cor. 4:5, "Therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord
comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and
will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man
have praise of God."

1 Cor. 10:29, "Conscience, I say, not thine own but of the other: for
why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?" Live and let
live. Live your life as unto the Lord, not unto people..

Col. 2:16, "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in
respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days..."
That is, let the other believer live his life as unto the Lord.

James 4:11,12, "Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaks
evil of his brother, and judges his brother ... there is one lawgiver,
who is able to have and to destroy: who are you that keeps on judging
another?" This person sets himself up as God when judging in this
manner.

USES OF (anakrino)

"To examine for answers" ... "to pass judgment upon", which comes to
mean "to examine". This is a legitimate activity, especially concerning
our attitude toward the scriptures. Acts 17:11, "These were more noble
(open-minded) than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the Word
with all readiness (eagernes\~) of mind, and searched (anakrino) the
Scriptures (daily), whether those things were so."

1 Cor. 10:25-27, "...eat, asking no question, for conscience
sake...whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for
conscience sake." The idea is that we are not to make an issue out of
food set before us by passing judgment on it.

"To discern" (while in fellowship) ...

The proof that anakrino takes on a good connotation is found in the
following passage, among others. The term "spiritual" indicates that the
believer in fellowship can be discerning without condemnation from God.

1 Cor. 2:14,15, "But the natural man (unbeliever) receiveth not the
things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; neither
can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned (anakrino ).
But he that is spiritual (in fellowship) judgeth (discern\~) all things,
yet he himself is judged of no man."

USES OF (diakrino)

"To be at odds with oneself, to doubt, to waver":

Rom. 4:20, "He (Abraham) staggered (diakrino) not at the promise of
God..."

Rom. 14:23, "And he that doubteth (diakrino) is damned if he eat,
because he eateth not of faith: for whatsover is not of faith is sin."
This is an introspective judging which proceeds out a guilt complex.

"To make a distinction":

1 Cor. 4:7, "For who maketh thee to differ from another" This is
describing the sin of partiality, exalting one person over another; it
is failure to recognize that a person is what he is because of the Grace
of God.

"To judge oneself":

1 Cor. 11:31, "For if we would judge (diakrino) ourselves, we should not
be judged (krino).

"To render a decision":

1 Cor. 6:5, "I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise
man among you? No, not one that shall be able to judge between his
brethren?"

USE OF (kritiko\~)

Used only once in the Word of God, to describe the quality of the Word
of God as an absolute criterion of judgment.

Heb. 4:12, "For the Word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than
any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner (kritiko\~) of
the thoughts and intents of the heart."




USE OF (diakrisi\~)

Heb. 5:14, "But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age (mature
believer\~) even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised
to discern (diakrisi\~) both good and evil." The believer who uses the
Word of God in fellowship will be able to discern a great deal.

Justification
-------------

**Definition:**

*Justification* is God’s act of grace by which He pardons
a sinner and accepts him as righteous on account of the atoning work of
Jesus Christ on the Cross. Remission of sin, absolution from guilt, and
freedom from punishment are part of justification.

In order to be justified, a person must be given a righteousness
equivalent fo God’s perfect righteousness. Hence, *imputation* precedes
justification. Imputation is the charging to the account of one person
something which properly belongs to another. The Lord Jesus Christ
shares his perfect righteousness with the believer, **Rom. 3:22; 4:11;
9:30-32; 4:4,5 \*\*.**

Because righteousness has been imputed to us, God calls us “justified”.
“Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness.”
Hence, imputation of righteousness on the basis of faith brings about
justification.

The means of justification is *redemption*, **Rom. 3:24**. “Being
justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus.”

Justification produces *reconciliation*. **Rom. 5:1**

Because God the Father is satisfied (*propitiation*), we are freely
justified.

Justification occurs at the moment of a person’s faith in Jesus Christ,
**Rom. 3:28; 5:1; Gal.3:24.**

Justification does *not* occur through keeping the Law of Moses, **Gal.
2:16**.

Justification during the believer’s lifetime is described in **James
2:21-25**. This is the function of the Faith-Rest principle in living
the Christian Way of Life under grace.

The principle of temporal justification is found in **Matt. 11:19** and
**Luke 7:35**.

Mental Attitude
---------------

Introduction

As a believer progresses in his Christian life, he experiences many
profound changes in his thinking. His standards change gradually but
radically; his frame of reference changes; his mental attitude soon
becomes very different from what it once was. His previous way of
thinking is replaced by the "mind of Christ" - God's viewpoint is
becoming his own.

The greatest occupational hazard faced by a Christian is the failure to
grow in Christ. Persistent personal sin carried on without repentance
and confession keeps the Christian out of fellowship with the Lord and
hinders the work of the Holy Spirit in the life.

The normal Christian life is a supernatural life. This life cannot be
lived apart from the daily intake of spiritual food, the sustenance
which comes with the study of the Bible accompanied by the continuous
control and ministry of the Holy Spirit. Inattention to the teaching of
the Word of God concerning the mechanics of daily Christian living
results in failure to grow in Christ. The believer who will not overcome
these problems will not be able to enjoy the benefits and blessings of
the Christian life, and he will certainly not be productive as a child
of God.

This article reviews several factors relating to the subject of the
believer's mental attitude. First, we note several categories of mental
attitude sin which are the result of "not thinking Grace". Then we see
the methods by which God arranges for human viewpoint thinking to be
replaced with divine viewpoint thinking. This study will also show some
of the important results in the life of the Christian who develops a
godly mental attitude.

The Sin of Not Thinking Grace

A Christian decides many times every day whether he will follow God's
plan for his life. In decisions great or small he expresses either his
dependence on the Lord or his desire to be independent of God's
direction. A believer has access to the perfect plan of God for his
life, a plan which has certain predetermined divine standards by which
every situation can be measured, by which every decisive opportunity can
be judged. Many promises and blessings are available for use by the
person who orders his life according to the patterns laid out in the
Bible.

The person who is not positive to the plan of God, and who would apply
his own human standards to life situations, does not operate by divine
standards. He becomes involved in a variety of mental attitude sin
problems stemming from his original decision to be independent of God.
His life takes on the characteristics of one who does not "think Grace".

Grace is that characteristic of God which is an extension of His love
for the human race and which causes Him to provide for every human need
for time and eternity. The sacrificial death of Jesus Christ on the
Cross was the Work which made it possible for God to view every person
as free from the guilt of sin and as an object of God's Grace
provisions.

Failure to order one's thinking according to Grace involves several
aspects of mental attitude sin, including the following :

A SPIRIT OF PRIDE -- this is an exalted feeling based on personal
success or position, or based on good training or education, on personal
appearance, or on some natural gift or ability. Sinful pride is an inner
feeling of self-importance which does not take into account God's
provision of every resource and quality which goes into one's human
traits and capabilities.

LOVE OF, OR DESIRE FOR, HUMAN APPROBATION AND PRAISE -- this is a secret
fondness for being noticed and recognized. It is a love of supremacy, or
it is the drawing of attention to oneself by various types of
exhibitionism or by spiritual one-upmanship.

SELF WILL -- this is the concept of the stubborn or unteachable nature,
or implacability. Self will is a disposition to be argumentative, harsh,
bitter, which causes one to be a "nit picker" or critical in the
extreme, or to mind the business of others, or to fail to recognize the
rights and privacy of others.

SINFUL REACTION TO SOCIAL PRESSURES -- these are the sins of anger,
impatience, touchiness, or of having a sensitive nature. There is often
resentment and retaliation when disapproved or contradicted. This area
of sin generates jealousy, sour grapes, envy, and the accompanying
bitterness, hatred, carrying of grudges, revenge tactics, and so forth.

Magnifying the faults and failings of others while emphasizing one's own
virtues.

NEGATIVE DISPOSITION -- this is peevishness, a fretful disposition, one
that loves to be coaxed and honored. It is a dishonest, deceitful
attitude. It is a disposition that tends toward discouragement and
despondency under pressure along with the attempt to solve one's
problems by hysteria and tantrums.

APATHY -- this sin is that of indifference to doctrine and to the Word
of God in general. It is indifferences to the lost condition of
unbelievers or to the carnal condition of other believers.

Characteristics of a Believer’s Mental Attitude

The true character of a believer in Jesus Christ is determined by his
mental attitude. Prov. 23:7, "As a man thinks in his heart, so is he".
See also 1 Pet. 1:13; 4:1; Heb. 12:3; Col. 3:1,2; 1 Cor. 2:16; 2 Cor.
10:4,5.

A Christian's mental attitude is not always apparent in his actions, but
God always knows perfectly what a person is thinking. Heb. 4:12,13;
Prov. 21:2. The following are examples of mental attitude thinking.

Worldliness is a mental attitude. Worldliness is not the doing of
something wrong; it is the thinking which takes place independently of
God's viewpoint. The remedy to the problem of worldliness is not in
turning over a new leaf. It is a change in thinking (repentance) rather
than a change in activity. Divine viewpoint must replace human viewpoint
before a change in character can be expected. One can have an outward
life which appears good, yet be filled with mental attitude sins. Col.
3:2; James 4:4.

Toughness, strength, and determination are mental attitudes. One is not
beaten until he gives up mentally.

True Christian inner peace is a mental attitude. It is the relaxed
mental state which enables one to enjoy the Christian life regardless of
people or outward circumstances. With a good mental attitude, the
believer can be joyful, relaxed, and can even enjoy the battle.

Mental stability is the result of thinking from a proper frame of
reference, that is, Biblical thinking. The Christian who has mental
fear, who is a chronic worrier, who cannot think clearly under pressure,
who blames others for his problems, who cannot make correct decisions --
that believer is unstable. His emotions interfere with his thinking.
Since emotion always follows thinking, emotional instability will always
follow from incorrect (HVP) thinking. But God's Plan of Grace leads to
rock-solid mental and emotional stability.

Man’s Ideas vs Divine Viewpoint

Thinking requires words - vocabulary. Divine thinking requires divine
vocabulary. "Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that
proceeds from the mouth of God." Under any kind of spiritual pressure,
human vocabulary, or human thinking, is not adequate. Only God's words
can give the ability to think correctly under pressure. The Christian's
ability to think correctly is based on how much Bible teaching is
resident (applied) in the soul of the believer.

The Christian is commanded to have a new mental attitude. Col. 3:1,2; 2
Cor. 10:4,5; 1 Cor. 2:16; Phil. 2:5.

The warfare between two viewpoints in the believer's soul must be fought
from within, first by knowledge of doctrine, and then by the application
of truth to the life. 2 Tim. 2:15; 1 John 1:9.

Every believer has a mind which is capable of looking at life from God's
point of view. Rom. 1:18 ff. Mental attitude divine viewpoint is
obtained only through Bible study accompanied by the controlling
ministry of the Holy Spirit. The Christian who habitually studies the
Word learns to concentrate and to think from God's point of view, and
thus he becomes stabilized. The "mind of Christ" (the source of God's
viewpoint) is made clear in the Bible.

The Christian can be "transformed by the renewing of the mind" through
study, knowledge, and application of Bible truth. By this means his
decisions and actions are most likely to be in agreement with Bible
principle. And this is the only sure sign of Christian maturity and
victorious Christian living.

The Human Conscience

The conscience is located in the mind and is the center for the
operating standards of the human soul. Titus 1:15. The conscience
convicts the Christian of evil or wrongdoing. John 8:9. The conscience
establishes standards for both human and divine relationships. Acts
24:16.

The conscience functions on thinking; and the believer in fellowship has
a conscience which functions from resident (applied) divine viewpoint.
Rom. 2:15; 9:1, as related to applied Bible teaching. The conscience
establishes standards for serving God. 2 Tim. 1:3; Heb. 9:14. But false
operating standards in the conscience produce legalism. 1 Cor. 8:7.

The more the believer uses applied Bible doctrine, the stronger his
conscience becomes in using such thinks as the Law of Liberty and the
superseding laws of love and sacrifice. 1 Cor. 10:24-29. Conscience is
the basis for enduring mistreatment and misunderstanding without
defending oneself. 1 Pet. 2:19; 3:16. The conscience can be damaged or
destroyed with false doctrine and with a callused soul. 1 Tim. 4:1,2.

The Mechanics of Replacing Human Viewpoint with Divine Viewpoint

The Christian life is a supernatural life and cannot be lived without
the filling of the Holy Spirit and the daily function of applied Bible
teaching. Rom. 8:2; 7:6; Gal. 5:25; Eph. 5:18. All changes must come
from within, and the Holy Spirit must originate divine good by applying
doctrine to the life.

We begin a change of viewpoint at the moment of salvation. At that time
we changed our mental attitude toward the Lord Jesus Christ. Acts 3:19.
That was repentance and faith, and it resulted in our regeneration. John
3:16. At that moment many benefits were made available to us, blessings
and promises from God which enable us to live in a manner which is both
acceptable to the Lord and which also produces great happiness for us.
We are given the ability to think those things which will bring honor to
the Lord. Eph. 5:18; 4:23; Col. 3:2.

The choice of whether to make use of the divine operating assets is made
by the believer every day. The power or our walk with the Lord depends
on Bible teaching, the work of the Holy Spirit, and the believer's
positive volition. Daily Bible teaching under the controlling ministry
of the Holy Spirit builds up divine standards in the human soul and
conscience. 1 Tim. 1:5,19; 3:9.

The Benefits a Proper Mental Attitude

With the proper mental attitude, the Christian will have victory, peace,
power, and mental stability. Phil. 2:5; 2 Tim. 1:7. The Christian can
experience perfect inner peace, ever during times of difficulty and
suffering. Phil. 4:7. Inner peace comes from what we think. Isa. 26:3.
Divine viewpoint brings mental stability and eliminates discouragement,
anxiety, instability, fearfulness, and double-mindedness. Stability of
mind and character is a mental attitude of strength.

The believer with divine viewpoint has a gracious attitude toward
others. He is a mature believer characterized by mental attitude love
who is a channel of the Grace of God. Deut. 6:5; 11:13. A mental
attitude from DVP produces confidences based on absolute values and
standards. 2 Cor. 5:1,6,8.

Mental Attitude and the Believer’s Ministry

The mature believer "thinks Grace", which is the "mind of Christ".
Therefore, the Christian's life and personality are characterized by
many of the qualities of the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. Rom. 8:29;
Gal. 5:22 ff. In every one of these characteristics the Christian has
one basic ingredient - correct thinking according to divine viewpoint. 1
Pet. 3:8

Therefore, the mature believer is gentle, compassionate, caring, and has
a gracious attitude toward others. With these qualities, and with the
knowledge of the Word of God being acquired on the way to maturity, the
believer cannot help but be an outstanding witness for Christ and a
skilful practitioner in the use of his spiritual gifts.

Old Age
-------

Many people have a tremendous dread of growing old. A great deal of
activity during the working years is aimed at preventing as many of the
problems of old age as possible: dependency on others, lack of money,
bore-dom, ill health, and so forth. The very fear of the problems of old
age often make mental and physical wrecks of people -- they become old
before their time.

God's Plan is that old age be the crowning glory of a person's lifetime.
The Word of God shows that old age can have promise, produc¬tivity,
vitality, confidence, and a great deal of happiness, providing that
spiritual preparation has taken place during the younger years.

Age Divisions in the Bible

The Bible indicates that there are three broad divisions of a lifetime.

The period of youth lasts up to about 40 years of age. Moses began to
sense his re¬sponsibility to Israel and to the Lord when he was about
40, Acts 7:23. He spent 40 more years in training, however, before he
became leader of the people of Israel. It was during the years from 80
to 120 that he did his great work.

In Acts 4:22, a man is healed and the Sanhedrin wanted to ridicule his
testimony. However, "the man was above forty years old on whom this
miracle of healing was shown", indicating that he was mature enough to
know what had happened.

In 1 Tim. 4:12, Paul writes, "Let no man despise thy youth." Timothy was
in his thirties at the time.

The period of middle age last from about 40 to 60 years of age. In 1
Tim. 5:9, a 60–year–old widow's retirement was into a full time ministry
of prayer supported by the church. Many believers hit their top pace in
the middle years. The high priest's work load was heaviest between 30
and 50.

Old age is the period from 60 on. In Daniel 12, Daniel, at age 90, was
told to stop acting like a dead man and to get going. In Luke 2:36-38, a
woman of great age (84) was very active in serving the Lord.

Some Principles of Old Age

Old age is a mental attitude as well as a physical problem. People
shudder when you discuss old age. Next to the subject of death, it is
the least favorite topic. There are many ways people try to postpone old
age. They try various products to keep on looking and feeling young.
They try traveling to relieve boredom and to give a sense of
fulfillment. They use gadgets and programs to postpone old age.

But, the older one becomes as a believer, the better life should become!
God's Plan is bigger than any problem this life can produce. Of course,
to take advantage of this plan, a person must understand Salvation and
receive Christ as Savior. Then, the individual must get Bible teaching
every day over a period of years to make it possible to obtain the
maximum out of every day of life. According to God's Plan of Grace,
which includes the concept of Dying Grace, the last day of your life
should be the best.

But some of the most miserable old people around are Christians. They
are cantankerous and obnoxious. Their youth is no longer there to
protect them. They are seen for what their souls really are, without the
camouflage of youth. "As a man thinks in his heart, so is he." Youth is
excused for bad behavior; but youth is no longer there to cover up. Old
age exposes all the faults, habits, obnoxious characteristics, and
degeneracy of soul.

When King Solomon reached old age, he wrote Ecclesiastes; and he has
some advice for youth. A young person can prepare now to have a happy
old age. Happiness is not in working, and it is not in retirement; it is
not in this diversion or that. True happiness is in Christian growth,
the production of the Fruit of the Spirit, operating on Divine
Viewpoint, having a healthy edification structure in the soul -- having
the inner beauty of soul.

"Rejoice, O young man!" "Find happiness when you are young." Then you
can carry your happiness around with you, the inner mental happiness
found in the Word of God, a happiness which does not depend on
conditions, circumstances, people, or the details of life. This leads to
a marvelous old age!

"And let thy heart cheer you in the days of your youth." Then you won't
fight old age; old age will be the best age of all. This type of person
is the salt of the earth in his old age, an aristocrat of the Christian
family.

"Walk in the ways of your heart." Now the young person who is immersed
in doctrine uses the Word of God in living the Christian Way of Life.
"In the sight of thine eyes." The application of the Word of God to
experience.

"But know that God will bring you to judgment; therefore remove sorrow
from your heart, put away evil from thy flesh." This is a picture of
judgment, chastisement, confession, claiming promises.

Therefore, old age is a mental attitude developed during a lifetime. The
older one becomes as a believer, the better life should become.
Happiness in old age is dependent on what is built up during the
previous years of youth and middle age.

Problems of Old Age

As you read the following listing of the problems of old age, meditate
on the Word of God and try to think of the doctrinal "antidote" for each
problem. The prescription will be given in the succeeding sections of
this article; but try finding answers in your own repertoire of
doctrine.

Old age may bring on a lack of mental sharpness. This can occur because
of physical debility. Also, if the mind has been neglected, especially
if the Word of God has been neglected, there will be a failure of the
mentality.

In old age, there can be a disorientation to life from the standpoint of
success standards. A person looks back and regards life as a failure.
Maybe he set goals, and now he is old and never realized the goals.
There is a great danger of disillusionment.

There is a tendency for great increase in mental attitude sins in old
age, with emphasis on criticism and judgment. These things are often
overlooked in youth; but they are horrible in the elderly.

There is often a lack of security in old age, especially if the old
people can't take care of themselves financially. Their children are in
the prime of their lives and often the children's plans do not include
them.

Old age may bring an inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, inability
to converse, to hear, to see. So the old person gets used to sitting in
a chair daydreaming, vegetating, saying nothing.

There is sometimes a lack of motive to live, too much idle time, and too
much time for complaining. There may be a desire to travel but no means
to do so. So there is a lack of significant things to do.

Old age brings future shock. Old age finds itself out of phase with the
younger generations of children and grandchildren. Therefore a dangerous
trend can get started toward hypercriticism.

The older believer may have stopped growing spiritually, or worse, may
never have got started. There is, therefore, no edification, no
occupation with Christ, no desire for the Word. There is a tendency to
stagnate, to become jaded, to rely on the study done years before.

There can be a tendency toward the negatives of Titus 2:3, becoming
false accusers, gossips, evil speakers, vicious in criticism.

There is a tendency among older believers to drink quite a lot when they
don't have anything else going for them.

Then, there is the tendency to think that getting old means that a
person has some wisdom. So there is the garrulous senior citizen who
never stops talking and inflicts continuous boredom on his listeners
with his platitudes and homely chatter.

A Godly and Grace-Filled Old Age

Coming into old age, the mature believer is assured of his redemption;
and he comes into old age as a knowledgeable, productive Christian. He
understands both salvation and spirituality. He knows how to claim
promises. He understands suffering, has lived through some of it, and
looks forward to greater tests. He is ready for both suffering and
happiness in old age.

This person comes into old age able to apply the Word of God to
experience. Even his mind is saved, according to the principles of
Romans 12:2. He realizes that there are many books, but only one Book,
the mind of Christ, the Word of God.

The elderly believer uses the Faith-Rest principles of life. While the
body is getting weaker, there is this promise of 2 Cor. 4:15.

"For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might
through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. For which
cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward
man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a
moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."

Characteristics of a Beautiful Old Age

Review the following scripture passages to get a thorough understanding
from Bible examples just what an exciting and productive old age can be
like.

In 1 Tim. 5:5-10, there is the example of a widow alone who faces the
occupational hazard of widowhood in loneliness. However, this woman
trusts in God, uses the promises of the Bible, and keeps on praying. A
widow who is "well reported for good works" is making the most out of
old age.

In Acts 11:36-43 is the story of Dorcas, "full of good works", given to
hospitality, who "washed the saints feet", made garments, relieved the
afflicted with her nursing skills, and was a producer of divine good.
She had mastered the details of life.

In Tim. 2:1,2 there is a discussion of the characteristics of godly
elderly men. They are to be healthy minded, alert, sharp, with
Christlike character, masters of the details of life ("temperate"),
"sound in faith", having spiritual healthy because of doctrine, being
free from mental attitude sins such as bitterness, envy, hostility,
having mental attitude love.

In Tim. 2:3 ff are listed the characteristics of godly older women.
Their shining inner beauty reflects the glory of God. They are not false
accusers or guilty of maligning, evil speaking, or gossip, and they are
not vindictive. They are also temperate and able to teach good things to
the younger women. They had skill and wisdom and had the willing
attention of younger women. They taught the young women to be healthy
minded, emotionally stable, to have sound judgment, to be poised, in
control of themselves, thoughtful, to be free from carnality ("chaste"),
to be morally good, and to respond to their husbands.

From these illustrations we conclude that there is plenty to do in old
age, that old age can be a golden age, not necessarily in reliving the
"good old days", but in actively enjoying the present and the future.

Paul the Apostle
----------------

The apostle Paul was one of the most famous citizens of the Roman Empire
and without question one of the most influential individuals in history.
He was used by the Lord in his missionary and evangelistic activities to
set in motion a great deal of the organization known as the Christian
Church, the Body of Christ on earth, to the extent that billions of
human beings have been directly or indirectly affected by his ministry.
Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he wrote the foundation
documents for the Christian way of life, the Word of God which has
changed the lives of millions.

Paul’s Education

Paul was educated by his mother until the age of five. From age five to
ten he studied with his father in the Hebrew scriptures and traditional
writings. At the same time, being a Roman citizen and living in a Greek
and Roman environment, he received a thorough education in the Greek
language, history, and culture.

He was sent to Jerusalem at about the age of ten to attend the
rabbinical school of Gamaliel, who was the son of Simeon the son of
Hillel. Gamaliel was a most eminent rabbi who was mentioned both in the
Talmud and in the New Testament (ACTS 5:24-40; 22:3). Gamaliel was
called Rabban - one of only seven teachers so called. He was a Pharisee,
but he rose above party prejudice. He composed a prayer against the
Christian “heretics”. He lived and died a Jew.

At this time, Herod was dead, and the Romans had complete control of
Judea, hence, there was Roman money, language, and culture. The Jews,
therefore, were inclined to cling more closely to their religion as the
center of unity. [Refer to the topic: JUDEAN HISTORY]

There were two great rabbinical schools, those of Hillel and Schammai.
Hillel, the grandfather of Gamaliel, held that tradition was superior to
the Law. The school of Schammai despised traditionalists, especially
when there teachings clashed with the writings of Moses.

The religious school of Gamaliel (Hillel) was chiefly oral and usually
had a prejudice against any book but Scripture. They used a system of
Scriptural exegesis, and Josephus in his writings expressed the wish to
have such a power of exegesis. When school was in session, learned men
met and discussed scriptures, gave various interpretations, suggested
illustrations, and quoted precedents. The students were encouraged to
question, doubt, even contradict.

When Paul became a Christian, his very thorough education was enormously
helpful. He was able to assimilate Christian doctrines rapidly and
relate them accurately to the Scripture teaching he had received. From
his education, both from Gamaliel and in the desert from the Lord Jesus
Christ, Paul developed a divine viewpoint attitude toward human history.

Paul knew that the existence of God can easily be perceived by anyone,
that man can become aware of God, but that many men’s deliberate halted
this good beginning by immoral activities which accompanied their
idolatry. Therefore, Paul had an intense hatred of idolatry of any kind.

Paul’s teaching shows that the only reality is God. Idolatry distorts
man’s conception of the world and external nature. Idolatry is the enemy
of mankind.

Paul knew the law of growth of human nature. As a Roman, Tarsian,
Hebrew, and culturally Greek, he knew of the many distortions of the
life of his society. As a nation becomes unhealthy, development is
halted. Societies errors as to the nature of God and the true relation
of God to man prevented nations from getting rid of their besetting
evil.

The books of Acts is the chief authoritative record for the ministries
of Paul and the other apostles. For a brief outline of Paul’s ministry,
see the CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF PAUL’S MINISTRY. The most thorough,
accurate, and interesting secular work on Paul is The Life and Epistles
of St. Paul, by Conybeare and Howson.

Paul, The Prisoner for the Gentiles

The Lord made Paul a missionary to the Gentiles, even revealing to him
during the period of his arrest in Palestine, and during his subsequent
trials before Jewish and Roman authorities, that he should “be of good
cheer, for you must bear witness of Jesus at Rome.”

After a considerable stay at Antioch after his second missionary
journey, Paul departed and went over all the country of Galatia and
Phrygia in order to strengthen the disciples (ACTS 18:23). During this
time, he also gave directions for the collection for the poor in
Jerusalem.

He came to Ephesus, probably in about 53 A.D. He found there twelve
disciples of Apollos who had only received John’s baptism and were not
aware of the Holy Spirit and Church Age mysteries.

He taught three months in the synagogue in Ephesus. In the face of
opposition, he took his classes to the school of one, Tyrannus, where he
taught daily for two years. Exorcists were converted and books of magic
were burned by the new converts. He paid a visit to Corinth, then
returned to Ephesus where he wrote 1 Corinthians.

Paul left for Troas and Macedonia because of the danger in Ephesus from
the silversmiths and craftsmen who made articles for the worship of
Diana. (See Topic: EPHESU\~) He sailed to Macedonia to meet Titus,
landed at Neapolis and went to Philippi where he was “comforted by
Titus.” He sent Titus to Corinth with the second Corinthian letter and
instructions for completing the collection there for needy Christians.

Paul traveled through Macedonia and finally arrived at Corinth himself,
staying there about three months and writing Romans. He took ship for
Miletus where he met for a few days with Ephesian elders. He then sailed
(island hopping to Coos, Rhodes, and Patara) to Tyre. From Tyre he
wailed to Ptolemais and reached Caesarea.

Paul was warned not to visit Jerusalem. He went anyway and was warmly
received by the brethren. He had an interview with James and the elders.
A charge was brought against him by the Sanhedrin that “he taught all
the Jews among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not
to circumcise their sons, neither to walk after their customs.” [For a
discussion of the Sanhedrin, see topic: JEWISH RELIGIOUS SYSTEM]

The Sanhedrin asked Paul to do a public act of the Law in order to prove
his faith. There were four men who were to undergo the ritual associated
with the Nazarite vow, and Paul was requested to put himself under that
vow and to pay the costs of the other four men. He did so.

After this some Jews from Asia stirred up the people against him,
charging him with bringing Greeks into the Temple. A Gentile man from
Ephesus named Trophimus was with Paul, and the Jews supposed that Paul
had brought him into the temple, which would have been a sacrilege. The
mob took Paul to kill him, but soldiers of the Roman garrison appeared.
Paul spoke to the mob in his own defense, telling of his mission to the
Gentiles. They shouted “Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it
is not fit that he should live.” (ACTS 22:1-23).

The Roman soldiers took Paul to the governor’s castle for interrogation
by scourging, at which time Paul claimed his Roman citizenship. The next
morning he was taken before the Sanhedrin, but there was no conclusion
because of the dissension between the Sadducees and Pharisees. Paul was
taken back to the castle for protection, and it was that night that the
Lord appeared to Paul telling him to “be of good cheer.” (ACTS 23:6-10)

There arose a conspiracy among forty Jews to assassinate Paul, but
Paul’s nephew brought him a warning of the plot. The Romans decided to
send him to Caesarea to Felix, the procurator (governor) of Judea (ACTS
22:21ff). Before Felix, Paul was merely asked from province he had come.
Five days later, the high priest Ananias and some of the Sanhedrin
appeared, with Tertullus as their advocate (ACTS 24:1-9). They made
charges, which Paul denied. Felix delayed the proceeding further until
Claudias Lysias, the captain of the Roman troops n Jerusalem, could come
to give evidence.

After a few days, Felix’ wife, Drusilla, a Jewess, wanted to see and
hear Paul. Paul appeared and gave the gospel to Felix and Drusilla.
Felix trembled but was unrepentant. He wanted a bribe from Paul so did
not acquit him. (Drusilla died in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, AD 79.)

Felix kept Paul a prisoner in Caesarea (under loose house arrest) for
two years until the arrival of Festus, the new governor. Festus wanted
Paul taken back to Jerusalem, but Paul was aware of the danger there and
uttered the Latin word Caesarem apello! -- “I appeal to Caesar!” Festus
was thus obliged to make arrangements for Paul to travel to Rome under
escort.

About this time, King Agrippa II, with his sister, Berenice, came to
visit Festus, the new governor. Festus pleaded ignorance of Jewish law,
so Paul made his testimony before Agrippa, with the greatest of pomp and
ceremony. This episode was one of the greatest defenses of the gospel
ever recorded. Agrippa said, “Almost you persuade me ...”

Festus decided then that Paul was innocent or wrongdoing, and he would
have let him go free if he had not appealed to Caesar.

Paul’s Voyage to Rome

Paul’s escort on the trip to Rome was a platoon of Roman soldiers under
Julius, a centurion of the Augustan Cohort. They sailed in a coasting
vessel to Adramyttium and Sidon. Paul was given liberty. The next port
was Myra, from which they took ship to Italy.

They sailed to Crete, stayed at the port of Fair Havens for one month,
sailed for Phoenix, and were driven on the rocks at Malta where they
stayed for three months. From Malta they sailed in the vessel “Castor
and Pollux” to Syracuse (Sicily) and Rhegium, the port city of the
Italian province of Puteoli. From there they went to Rome on the Appian
Way.

In Rome Paul dwelled in his own hired house under the supervision of a
Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. He was permitted t o hold meetings, and
he met with Jewish elders, winning some of them to Christ. This period
lasted two years, during which he wrote Philemon, Colossians, Ephesians,
and Philippians.

He was acquitted by Nero, so he was free to travel and did so. His
visits were to Crete and to Asia Minor; and it is widely thought that he
traveled in Spain on a missionary journey. He is thought to have been
arrested again in Ephesus and taken again to Rome from there, but this
time treated as a malefactor, with his friends deserting him (except for
Luke and Onesiphoru\~). There was persecution in Rome at this time, and
a campaign of terror by Nero against the Christians. Paul was condemned
and executed in Rome.

“I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.”

Preaching
---------

Definition and Etymology

The word “preach” is found in many places in the New Testament (KJV);
however, it has been translated from several different Greek words. For
example, in 1 Cor. 1:17, the phrase “preach the Gospel” comes from
(euangelidzo); while in 1:18 we see the phrase “the preaching of the
cross”. You can see that the translators took some liberties with their
use of the word “preach”.

The Greek verb (keiruso) was commonly used in ancient times to refer to
public proclamation or public teaching, and there are many NT verses
where it is found. A complete listing can be found in a Greek
concordance.

The noun (keirux) refers to the “proclaimer; publisher; messenger” who
is making the proclamation. Thus,

1 Tim. 2:7, “Whereunto I (Paul) am ordained a preacher (keirux), and an
apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the
Gentiles in faith and truth.” (Likewise in 2 Tim. 1:11)

In 2 Pet. 2:5, Abraham is called a “preacher (keirux) of righteousness”.

The word keirux was used in several ways in ancient times. The keirux
was a “publisher”, or "herald", in the sense that he would broadcast
important news to townspeople. The person making official proclamations
or announcements to the public was called keirux, a sort of town crier.

A man assigned to carry messages between enemies on a battlefield was
also called keirux.

The message of the keirux is the (keirugma). The keirugma is what was
given to the keirux to proclaim. The originator of the message may have
been a battlefield officer or a public official.

In the Bible, the keirux is the preacher, the keirugma is his message,
and keiruso is the act of preaching.

The English word "preaching" would be correct if it were used in its
primary etymological sense of "proclaiming before the public", the
meaning which is derived from the Latin, praedicere. However, the modern
use of "delivering a moral discourse or religious message of any kind
and in any manner" does not give the meaning of keirugma. There is no
finger-pointing or arm waving in keirugma.

Scripture References Using keirugma

In Matt. 12:41 and Luke 11:32, Jonah's message to the Ninevites is
called keirugma . Jonah's job was to proclaim God's message of salvation
in the Assyrian capital.

1 Cor. 1:17-22, "For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the
gospel (euangelidzw): not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ
should be made of none effect.

For the preaching (logo\~) of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.

For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring
to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this
world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

[Note: to "stop the mouths" of those who are opposed (Titus 1:9-11), the
Lord employs preachers to bring an unusual message.]

For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it
pleased God by the foolishness (moria\~) of preaching (keirugma) to save
them that believe.

For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:

But we preach (keiruso) Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;

But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power
of God, and the wisdom of God.

1 Cor. 2:1-10

Titus 1:3

Principles of keirugma

​1. The emphasis of keirugma is on the message. Someone in authority,
who has something to communicate, gives the message to a messenger, the
keirux, preacher, who passes the information on to someone else, usually
in a public setting. It is expected that there will be attentive hearers
who will be receptive to the message and who expect to derive some
benefit from the message.

​2. The messenger does not proclaim his own viewpoint, his own political
opinions, his own grievances. The message is another person's
communication. The public proclamation is not the platform for him to
expound his own theories, to support his side in a debate, talk about
his own projects, or get things off his chest. The keirux does not call
the people together for an important proclamation, then, instead,
lecture them on some private matter not associated with the real
message.

​3. The Bible teacher gets his keirugma from God Himself, as revealed in
the Word of God. Correct preaching is done by making the message clear
to the people who are listening to the proclamation. Public teaching
protects the privacy of the believer. Confining himself to the message,
the preacher does not unduly influence the listeners with personality
dynamics or bullying techniques. The listener can accept or reject the
message in private.

Propitiation
------------

Propitiation is the work of the Lord Jesus Christ by which He appeases
the wrath of God and conciliates Him who would otherwise be offended by
our sin and would demand that we pay the penalty for it.

Propitiation is translated from the Greek '(hilasterion), meaning "that
which expiates or propitiates" or "the gift which procures
propitiation". The word is also used in the New Testament for the place
of propitiation, the "mercy seat". Heb. 9:5. There is frequent similar
use of hilasterion in the Septuagint. Ex. 25:18 ff. The mercy seat was
sprinkled with atoning blood on the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16:14),
representing that the righteous sentence of the Law had been executed,
changing a judgment seat into a mercy seat (Heb. 9:11-15; compare with
"throne of grace" in Heb. 4:14-16; place of communion, Ex. 25:21-22).

Another Greek word, (hilasmo\~), is used for Christ as our propitiation.
1 John 2:2; 4:10, and for "atonement" in the Septuagint (Lev. 25:9). The
thought in the Old Testament sacrifices and in the New Testament
fulfillment is that Christ completely satisfied the just demands of a
holy God for judgment on sin by His death on the Cross.

God, foreseeing the Cross, is declared righteous in forgiving sins in
the Old Testament period as well as in justifying sinners under the New
Covenant (Rom. 3:25,26; cf. Ex. 29:33, note). Propitiation is not the
placating of a vengeful God but, rather, it is the satisfying the
righteousness of a holy God, thereby making it possible for Him to show
mercy without compromising His righteousness or justice.

The Hebrew kaphar, means "to propitiate, to atone for sin".. According
to scripture, the sacrifice of the Law only covered the offeror's sin
and secured divine forgiveness. The Old Testament sacrifices never
removed man's sin. "It is not possible...", Heb. 10:4. The Israelite's
offering implied confession of sin in anticipation of Christ's sacrifice
which did, finally, "put away" the sins "done previously in the
forbearance of God". Rom. 3:25; Heb. 9:15,26. The word "atonement" does
not occur in the New Testament; the word in Rom. 5:11 is
"reconciliation".

The beginning of the subject of Propitiation is found far back in the
Bible, back to the designing of the Tabernacle in the wilderness, the
tent which God had the people of Israel set up which would be the center
of His presence on earth.

The Tabernacle occupies a large portion of Scripture, sixteen chapters
in the book of Exodus and the whole book of Leviticus. Every feature of
the Tabernacle, of the worship carried out there, of the priestly life
and duties, of the vestments of the priests, the sacrifices, the feast
days-every feature was vitally important and designed by the Lord for
eternal purposes. It is very important for the Church Age believer to
have a good working knowledge of the Levitical system in order to
appreciate fully the work of Christ and the plan of God as they have
been instituted in the world.

There was great stress on the blueprint of the Tabernacle.

Exodus 25:8,9 "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among
them. According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the
tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so
shall ye make it."

The pattern was given to Moses on Mt. Sinai, along with The Law. READ
Hebrews 8:1–6. The Tabernacle was a symbolical expression of spiritual
truth.

The congregation of the Jews did not go beyond the courtyard of the
tabernacle. They made offerings only at the brazen altar; and only the
priests were allowed to go anyplace else in the Tabernacle. The
Tabernacle was the dwelling place of God on earth, and God was
unapproachable by sinful men. The main lessons being taught had to do
with the perfection of God and the sinfulness of man.

THE FURNITURE OF THE TABERNACLE

BRAZEN ALTAR -- this altar was the beginning of a person's approach to
God. Animal sacrifices made there taught that substitutionary sacrifice
is the first step toward fellowship with God. When a person passed
outside the gate of the Tabernacle, the only thing that he could see was
the smoke rising from the burnt offerings, and through the one gate
could be seen the altar of sacrifice and the blood being shed.
Everything else was hidden from view by the curtain of the fence. This
was a continuous reminder of "the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
the world." The only thing the unbeliever can ever see is the Gospel,
the good news of Christ's substitutionary sacrifice for us.

A description of the brazen altar is found in Ex. 27:1–8 and Ex. 38:17.

THE LAVER -- Here the priests cleaned their hands and arms before
performing any service or act of worship (Ex. 30:17). It was placed
between the brazen altar and the tent of worship (the Holy Place). This
cleansing symbolized the spiritual cleansing which is essential to both
worship and service.

THE CANDLESTICKS -- These illustrated the need for illumination, the
Light of the World. See Ex. 25:31–40; 37:17–34.

THE TABLE OF BREAD -- An illustration of the need for spiritual food.
See Ex. 25:23–30; 37:10–16.

THE ALTAR OF INCENSE -- From Ex. 30:1–10, this piece of Tabernacle
furniture illustrated the need for acceptable worship and prayer. No
animals were offered on this altar. The offering was an incense
offering, indicating that which is pleasing to God, Divine Good (gold,
silver, and precious stone\~). The fire for the altar of incense came
from the brazen altar, indicating that worship can only come after
salvation. No strange fire was allowed; and Nadab and Abihu died for
disobeying this rule.

THE VEIL -- the Veil symbolized the barrier between God and man; only
the High Priest could enter the Holy of Holies, and that only once a
year on the day of atonement, to offer the blood on the Mercy Seat of
the Ark of the Covenant.

THE ARK OF THE COVENANT -- the Ark of the Covenant was located in the
Holy of Holies of the Tabernacle. It was made of acacia wood and
overlaid with gold. Its dimensions were 50 inches long by 30 inches wide
by 30 inches deep. The Ark was a picture of Christ bearing our sins, the
box part representing Christ. The wood illustrated the humanity of
Christ, the gold represented His deity.

Inside the Ark were three objects representing sin (Num. 17:8,10; Heb.
9:4). The Tables of the Law represented sin in the sense of violation or
transgression of God's order. The Pot of Manna represented rejection of
God's provision. And Aaron's Rod represented revolt against God's
authority.

Over the top of the box was a lid of solid gold, the Mercy Seat (or
throne). Over each end of the Mercy Seat was a gold cherub, the highest
ranking angel. The first cherub represented the absolute Righteousness
of God, and the second cherub represented the Justice of God. Together
they represented the Holiness of God. The cherubs faced toward each
other, wings outstretched towards each other, and looked down at the
Mercy Seat. "Righteousness" looks down and condemns (Rom. 3:23).
"Justice" looks down and assesses a penalty.

Once a year, on the Day of Atonement, the High Priest went into the Holy
of Holies twice; once to make atonement for his own sins, and then to do
so for the people. He sprinkled blood from the sacrifice on the Ark, on
the top of the Mercy Seat, between the cherubs. This was a graphic
illustration of God's grace provision for sin. "Righteousness" looks at
the blood of the animal, which represents the spiritual death of Christ
on the Cross, His substitutionary atonement, and is satisfied. "Justice"
looks at the blood and is satisfied that the penalty paid for sin was
sufficient, teaching that Christ was judged and paid the penalty for us.

Therefore, the Ark speaks of Redemption - Christ paid for our sins, paid
our ransom, to purchase us from the slave market of sin.

So we have in the Ark and the Mercy Seat a picture of God's satisfaction
with the Work of Jesus Christ known as Propitiation.

Now, the Hebrew word for Mercy Seat is kapporeth. The Greek word used in
the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament is hilasterion. This
same Greek word is found in the New Testament in Rom. 3:25; Heb. 9:5; 1
John 2:2; and 4:10. and is translated "mercy seat" or "place of
propitiation". So there is a direct relationship between the Mercy Seat
in the Tabernacle and the doctrine of Propitiation.

Because of Propitiation, God is free to love the believer without
compromising either His Righteousness or Justice. The thought in the Old
Testament sacrifices and in the New Testament fulfillment is that Christ
completely satisfied the just demands of a holy God for judgment of sin.

Propitiation is not the placating of a vengeful God; but it is, rather,
the satisfying of the righteousness of a holy God making it possible for
Him to show mercy without compromise. Propitiation demonstrates the
consistency of God's character in saving the worst sinners. Propitiation
reconciles man to God. This means that sin is no longer the issued
between man and God. The only issue, both for the Old Testament and New
Testament believers, is "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
shalt be saved."

Purity
------

The apostle Paul told Timothy, “Keep yourself pure...”. Good advice for
a young man in the ministry. And when you look at all of the passages in
the Bible that have something to do with personal purity, you realize
that this Christian characteristic has a prominent place in God’s plan
for the Christian believer.

Jesus Christ exalts purity to the realm of the spirit, a type of purity
that is far greater than the ritual purity of ceremonial cleansing seen
in Jewish and other religions. This paper is aimed at showing you what
Christian purity is (and is not) and how you can grow to have this
purity.

The New Testament Greek word for purity is (**katharos**). It is found
in several New Testament passage, notably in Titus 1:15, “Unto the pure
all things are pure...” **katharos** is the usual Greek word for purity
and was used for several types of purity in the Greek world:

-   Ceremonial purity of a physical object, such as a vessel in a temple

-   Ceremonial purity of a temple worshipper

-   Purity in the spiritual nature of a person

In the ancient world, ceremonial cleansing would have been by some
ritual. In the New Testament, there is a deeper meaning: purity refers
to the result of cleansing of the soul by God. In this context, purity
is a characteristic of a believer in fellowship who has experienced the
“cleansing from all unrighteousness” promised in 1 John 1:9 to the one
who confesses sin to God.

Titus 1:15, *Unto the pure all things are pure...*

Reading this phrase, a cynical person may draw the wrong conclusion,
namely that a totally pure person can touch anything or think about
anything and remain pure as the driven snow. But this thinking involves
lifting this phrase out of the whole context of the Bible in order to
make it meaningless and false.

This does *not* mean, “All things are pure in the judgment of the pure.”

It’s true that a pure-minded man will not usually put evil constructions
or interpretations on things. But to say that something is pure because
he judges it to be so, or because he cannot be defiled, is false. The
context of Titus 1 makes it clear that the apostle Paul is referring to
matters of Judaistic practice, ceremonial purifications, among other
things, that have been misconstrued by false teachers.

Read the following passage from Luke 11:37-44.

And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and
he went in, and sat down to meat.

And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed
before dinner.

And the Lord said unto him, Now do you Pharisees make clean the outside
of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and
wickedness.

You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is
within also?

But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things
are clean unto you.

But woe unto you, Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and all manner
of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought you to
have done, and not to leave the other undone.

Woe unto you, Pharisees! for you love the uppermost seats in the
synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are as graves
which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.

Christ exalts purity to the realm of the spirit, which automatically
does away with ceremonial purity. A pure mind cannot be contaminated by
physical contact; and the purest minds will have no relish in seeking
defilement.

The following passage in 1 Timothy 1:4-7 talks about love out of a pure
heart, the fruit of the Holy Spirit. This is not a ritual love, nor is
it a love gained by striving for it. Here “good conscience” means
“cleansed” or “in fellowship”.

Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister
questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.

Now the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and of a
good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:

From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;

Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say,
nor whereof they affirm.

Problems of impurity in life are attacked in the area of the mind.
Timothy was commanded to “flee also youthful lusts...”. But he was told
in the same verse how to do this, to “follow righteousness, faith, love,
peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.”
(2 Tim. 2:22).

How often only the first part of the above verse is quoted, so that the
believer never learns how to have victory over areas of weakness. Lust
is desire - and desire is a mental attitude. So to “flee lusts” is to
nip the sin problem in the bud, while it is still only in the mind.
Confess, isolate, and forget the sin. Then, enjoy one more measure of
victory.

**1 Timothy 6:9-11**

But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into
many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
perdition.

For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted
after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through
with many sorrows.

But you O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness,
godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

**1 Peter 1:18-23**

Forasmuch as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible
things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by
tradition from your fathers;

But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and
without spot:

Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was
manifest in these last times for you,

Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave
him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.

Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the
Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that you love one
another with a pure heart fervently:

Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the
word of God, which lives and abides for ever.

Salvation is not by ceremony, but by the sacrifice of Christ. Morality
is not by ceremony, but by the purification of the soul through the Word
of God.

What is Christ’s purpose for the Church? “...Christ also loved the
church, and gave himself for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it
with the washing of water by the word.” (Eph. 5:25,26)

Purity is brought into the Christian’s life and maintained through (1)
Confession of sins which maintains fellowship with God and (2)
edification, which is the basis for growth in all areas, including
having victory over sin.




Rapture
-------

The word “rapture” refers to an event which will mark the end of the
Church Age and which will be an occasion of great joy to Christian
believers. All believers, both those who have died and those who are
alive at the time, will be taken up to meet Jesus Christ, who will have
returned to "the air", earth's atmosphere. Then, the Christians and the
Lord Jesus will return to heaven together. At the time of the Rapture,
Christ will not set foot on earth; and He will be visible only to
believers. READ 1 Thess. 4:17; Acts 1:11.

The Rapture is to be distinguished from the Second Advent of Christ.
While the Rapture sets the stage for the Second Coming, these are two
separate events. A chart giving comparisons between these two future
appearances of Christ is found in a later section of this article.

There has been controversy for many generations concerning the timing of
the final events in human history. The position held by the majority of
categorical and fundamental Bible teachers is as follows:

We are presently in the dispensation known as the Church Age, and we do
not know when this age will end.

The Rapture will occur at the end of the Church Age; and the day of the
Rapture will be the first day of the sever-year period known as the
Great Tribulation.

The Second Coming of Christ will occur on the last day of the
Tribulation period and will usher in the thousand-year reign of Jesus
Christ.

The statements above are part of a position, or viewpoint, concerning
the chronology of the final events of human history, a doctrinal concept
known as the Pre–Tribulation Rapture / Pre–Millennium Tribulation view.
There are several other schools of though among Christian scholars; and
this article does not attempt to sort out the differences in these
viewpoints categorically.

The study of the various points of view, and an examination of the
proofs that the Pre-Tribulation/Pre-Millennial position is the correct
one, is indeed a fascinating study. But the student needs considerable
background to handle such research, including a thorough knowledge of
general prophecy, a good general orientation to the whole Bible, and a
lot of practice in tracing threads of logic through interwoven networks
of Bible doctrine. For the purposes of this study we will settle for ...

A Description of the Rapture

The Rapture was promised by the Lord Jesus Christ just before His
crucifixion, John 14:1–3. At the Rapture, He keeps His promise and
fulfills the prophecy. The Rapture completes the Redemption of the body
because the believer receives a resurrection body at that time, Phil.
3:20,21; 1 John 3:1,2. It would be useful at this point to read the
description of the Rapture in 1 Cor. 15:51–53 and then to note the
comments below concerning the terminology used.

mystery -- a doctrine "hidden" from the Old Testament saints. The
Rapture is pertinent only to the Church Age and was never revealed to
believers living before the beginning of the Church Age.

we shall not all sleep --- i.e., there will be some believers alive at
the time of the Rapture.

we shall all be changed - refers to the resurrection body.

in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye -- a reference to the time
element. The Rapture is not a long, drawn out process of evacuation. We
will be with Christ instantly.

the dead shall be raised incorruptible -- the resurrection body does not
include the decay and corruption of sin and death.

we shall all be changed -- another reference to the new physical body
and new personal attributes associated with the resurrection body.

this corruptible must put on incorruption -the most important feature of
the resurrection body is that there will be no Sin Nature.

this mortal must put on immortality -- the believer will not die but
will receive an immortal body.

The dead in Christ (believers who have died previous to the Rapture)
will be raised first. Then, those who are still alive will be taken up.
1 Thess. 4:16,17.

The Rapture is a rendezvous for living and dead Christians. Confidence
in the Rapture is based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 1 Thess.
4:18.

In principle, the Lord Jesus Christ is the "first fruits" of the
believer, as noted in 1 Cor. 15:20–23. Read this passage first, then
note the following comments:

firstfruits -- pictures the resurrection of Christ which is a guarantee
of our bodily resurrection.

by man came death -- through Adam came spiritual death with the end
result of physical death for every human.

by man came also the resurrection -- by Jesus Christ, in His humanity,
came spiritual resurrection (salvation) followed by physical
resurrection, Phil. 3:21.

The word "hope", translated from the Greek word (elpi\~), meaning
"confidence", is a technical designation for the Rapture in at least
three Bible passages, including:

The living hope, 1 Peter 1:3

The blessed hope, Titus 2:13

The purifying hope, 1 John 3:3

The Rapture takes the sting out of death, 1 Cor. 15:54–56. Therefore,
the Rapture removes the despair of bereavement, 1 Thess. 4:13–18. This
confidence in the Rapture comes through the obtaining of wisdom,
discernment, and knowledge of the Plan of God, Job 19:25–27. The edified
believer has confidence. The result is blessing, peace, a relaxed mental
attitude, and stability.

The believer has a "reservation" in heaven, 1 Peter 1:4; Eph. 2:6. The
Rapture takes the believer to the "mansion" which Christ has prepared in
advance, John 14.

The testing which the believer and the Church endure during the Church
Age is terminated with the Rapture. The Body of Christ is no longer a
target of Satan in spiritual warfare.

It is not known, and cannot be predicted, when the Rapture will occur.
Nevertheless, the Bible directs us to pursue certain activities while
waiting for the Rapture. These are given in the last section of this
article. Meanwhile, take a look at ...

What to do While Waiting for the Rapture

Stay in Fellowship. "And now, little children, abide in Him; that when
He shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at
His coming." 1 John 2:28

Employ the Faith-Rest techniques. "Now we beseech you, brethren,
concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by forged letters as from us, as
that day of Christ is at hand." 2 Thess. 2:1,2

Have Confidence. "Being confident of this very things, that He which
hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
Christ." Phil. 1:6

Have Patience. "Be patient, therefore, unto the coming of the Lord..."
James 5:7

Grow in Christ by continuing to be edified. "...be ye also patient,
stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh." James
5:8 See also Isaiah 33:4 and 2 Tim. 2:15

Reconciliation
--------------

The word reconciliation refers to the process of changing something
thoroughly and adjusting it to something else that is a standard. For
example, when you adjust your watch to a time signal, you are
reconciling the watch to a time standard. Or when you reconcile your
checkbook, the standard to which you match it is the bank's record of
your account. On rare occasions the bank must reconcile its accounts to
yours.

In the Bible, reconciliation is the word used to refer to the process by
which God changes human beings and adjusts them to the standard of His
perfect character. Rom. 11:15 refers to the "reconciling of the world".
The Greek word used here is the noun (katallagei). This word is also
used in Rom. 5:11, "...but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation." Note that man
is not active in reconciliation and provides nothing toward
reconciliation. Read also 2 Cor. 5:17-21.

Reconciliation also appears in the verb form (katallasso), meaning "to
reconcile". It is used in the active voice in 2 Cor. 5:18 with the
meaning of "reconciling someone to someone else." In this case, God
reconciles us to Himself, through the Lord Jesus Christ. This verb in
the passive voice means "to be reconciled" or "to become reconciled",
and it is used in the case of man's relationship to God in Rom. 5:10 and
2 Cor. 5:20. The passive voice is also used in cases of reconciliation
between people, as in 1 Cor. 7:11 and Matt. 5:24.

Another Greek word translated "to reconcile" is (hilaskomai), meaning
"to reconcile" in the sense of providing propitiation, as in Luke 18:13.
It is used of the activity of the Lord Jesus Christ as High Priest in
making reconciliation for His people, Heb. 2:17.

Rom. 5:6-11 points out that the whole world needs to be reconciled to
God. Note the adjectives in this passage which stress this need:
"ungodly", "without strength", "sinners", "enemies".

Reconciliation is an important consideration in the study of the
doctrine of The Barrier. By the death of Christ on the Cross, the world
is thoroughly changed in its relationship to God, Eph. 2:14-18 and Col.
1:20-22. That is, through the Cross of Christ the world is so altered in
its position respecting the character and judgment of God that God does
not now impute sin to human beings. The world is therefore rendered
savable!

Because the position of the world before God is completely changed
through the substitutionary atonement of Christ, God's attitude toward
man can no longer be the same. God can now deal with souls in the light
of Christ's work.

Notice that God is never said to be reconciled to man. God is immutable,
so He does not change. Reconciliation is only possible in one direction.
What sometimes seems to be a change in God is actually an unchanged
attitude of God viewing a reconciled man. God, having how accepted
Christ's work, is able to continue to be just toward man. He can now
offer salvation.

A person profits from reconciliation by faith in the Gospel. Once he
becomes a believer, a person can partake in all of the blessings which
accompany his position in Christ, including the privileges accruing from
reconciliation.

The believer, in turn, has the responsibility of becoming a minister of
reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5:18–19. The truth of reconciliation is one of
the key salvation doctrines to be used in witnessing to those without
Christ.

Redemption
----------

Redemption is a comprehensive term used in the Bible to refer to the
special intervention of God for the salvation of mankind. This use of
the word deals with the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross in which He
paid the price to "purchase" human beings and set them free from their
slavery to sin. On account of Christ's substitutionary atonement, He is
called the Redeemer.

There are other ideas closely related to the primary concept of
redemption which relate to the necessity for redemption and its various
aspects and to the effects of the ministry of God's grace in the life of
the Christian believer.

Old Testament Background and Typology

Redemption of Firstborn Sons, Firstlings of the Flock, Firstfruits

The word "redemption" in the Old Testament is the translation of the
Hebrew word (pädäh), meaning "to deliver" or "to sever". It was
continuously stressed to the Israelites that they belonged to Jehovah
because He had redeemed them (severed them from bondage) and had
provided them with the land of Canaan for them to use as a gift from God
and for His glory. For this reason, all Israel owed their lives and
their service to God, in effect making the whole nation a kingdom of
priests, at least in spirit.

However, only Levi and the descendants of his tribe, who became known as
the priestly tribe, were actually set apart for the service of the
tabernacle. Everyone else from the eleven other tribes was to be
redeemed, or purchased, from service by redeeming the firstborn of both
men and animals.

A son was considered "firstborn" if he was the first son born to his
mother. If a man had more than one wife, each wife could have a
firstborn son. Each firstborn son was presented to the Lord on the 40th
day after his birth and redeemed by a payment of five shekels to the
priests (Num. 18:16: Ex. 13:15; Luke 2:27).

The firstlings of oxen, sheep, and goats were to be brought to the
sanctuary within a year and eight days after their birth, and sacrificed
(Num. 18:17).

The firstborn of an ass, which was an unclean animal, was redeemed by
sacrificing a sheep in its place; or, if not redeemed in this manner,
was put to death itself (Ex. 13:12 ff; 34:20). Later, the law provided
that the ass could be redeemed with money, the amount to be determined
by the market value of the ass plus 20%, according to the priest's
valuation (Lev. 27:27; Num. 18:15). (There is no more striking or
succinct picture in the Bible that this analogy to Christian salvation
issues.)

The firstfruits of the harvest were sacred to Jehovah because He is the
Lord of the soil (Ex. 23:19). These were given to the priest to be
presented in offering. The whole congregation was required to offer an
annual thanksgiving offering at harvest time by presenting a firstfruits
sheaf at the Passover. These were not to be burned but were to be given
to the priests for their use, with the provision that only those priests
who were ceremonially clean could eat the firstfruits. The amount of
offering of firstfruits was not specified by the Law but was left to
each person's discretion.

Later in Jewish history, the children of Israel began to be called the
Redeemed of the Lord, after they had been set free from the Babylonian
captivity (Isa. 35:9; 51:11; 62:12).

The Kinsman-Redeemer

According to the laws regarding punishment and retribution for crime,
when a person was assaulted, robbed or murdered, it fell to the nearest
kinsman to bring the criminal to justice and to protect the lives and
property of relatives. This obligation was called "redeeming", and the
man who was responsible for fulfilling this duty was known as a
"redeemer" (Heb. go-el). The job of redeemer would fall to full brothers
first, then to uncles who were the father's brothers, then to full
cousins, and finally to the other blood relatives of the family (Lev.
25:48). The kinsman-redeemer of the Old Testament was a type of the Lord
Jesus Christ as Redeemer. There were four requirements for the redeemer,
both in the type and in Christ:

​1. The redeemer must be a near kinsman. To fulfill this Christ took on
human form.

​2. The redeemer must be able to redeem. The price of man's redemption
was the blood of Christ (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 1:18-19).

​3. The redeemer must be willing to redeem (Heb. 10:4-10). Christ was
willing to be our Redeemer.

​4. The redeemer must be free from that which caused the need for
redemption; that is, the redeemer cannot redeem himself. This was true
of Christ, because He needed no redemption.

READ Ruth 3:9-13; 4:1-11.

The nation of Israel as a whole required a Redeemer to redeem the lands
which had been taken over by foreign powers, so they looked to Jehovah
to become their go-el. The period of exile gave an even greater force
and meaning to the term "redeemer" than it had before; and the book of
Isaiah contains nineteen of the thirty-three Old Testament references to
God as Israel's covenant redeemer.

Redemption in the New Testament

Slavery to Sin

In the New Testament we see that all people are slaves because all are
sold under sin and in spiritual bondage.

Rom. 7:14, "For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold
under sin."

Acts 8:23 uses the phrase "the bond of iniquity".

READ John 8:31-36

READ Romans 6:12-18

See also Rom. 7:23; 2 Tim. 2:26; 2 Pet. 2:19.

Furthermore, all people are helplessly condemned to die.

Ezek. 18:4, "Behold, all souls are mine, saith the Lord. As the soul of
the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul that sins, it
shall die."

1 Cor. 15:22, "As in Adam all die..."

See also John 3:18, 36; Rom. 3:19; Gal. 3:10.

The Principle of Redemption

The principle of redemption, then, is the concept of bondage to the
slavery of sin and freedom from its domination (John 8:31-36). To be
redeemed means to be "purchased from slavery".

The Greek word (lutroo), means "to release for ransom; to liberate; to
redeem". It comes from the word (luo) meaning "to loosen; to unbind; to
set at liberty". It is used in -

1 Pet. 1:18,19, "Forasmuch as you know that you were not redeemed
(lutroo) with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the
precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without
spot."

Titus 2:14, "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem (lutroo) us
from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of
good works."

The noun (lutron) means "the price paid; the ransom", as in -

Matt. 20:28, "Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
to minister, and to give his life a ransom (lutron) for many."

Jesus Christ purchased our freedom; and His blood is the payment for the
redemption. Psalm 34:22; 1 Peter 1:18,19; Gal. 3:13; Eph. 1:7; 1 John
1:7.

Therefore, Jesus Christ is man's Redeemer, and as such He is divinely
appointed. The redemption that He brought represents both His own love
and that of the Father for the whole world.

The word (agoradzo) means "to buy; to redeem; to acquire by paying
ransom". Derived from agora, "marketplace".

1 Cor. 6:20, "For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in
your body, and in you spirit, which are God's." This is analogous to the
OT idea in which the Israelites owed their very existence to God.

Rev. 5:9, "And they sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the
book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have
redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and
people, and nation."

See also 2 Pet. 2:1; Rev. 14:3.

The word (exagoradzo) means "to buy out of the hands of a person; to
redeem; to set free".

Gal. 3:13, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a
tree."

The word (apolutrosi\~) means "to dismiss for ransom paid; redemption".

1 Cor. 1:30, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto
us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption."

Rom. 3:23,24, "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God;
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in
Christ Jesus."

Eph. 1:7, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
of sins according to the riches of his grace."

Heb. 9:15, "And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that
were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the
promise of eternal inheritance."

Rom. 8:22,23, "For we know that the whole creation groans and travails
in pain together until not. And not only they, but ourselves also, which
have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body."

Eph. 1:13,14, "In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word
of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom after you believed, you
were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of
our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto
the praise of his glory."

Some Implications of the Doctrine of Redemption

Redemption is the basis of our eternal inheritance. See Eph. 1:13,14 and
Heb. 9:15 above.

Redemption is the basis of justification. Rom. 3:23, 24 (above).

Redemption includes the total forgiveness of sins; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14.

Redemption results in adoption.

Gal. 4:4-6, "But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His
Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them that were under
the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because you are
sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying,
Abba, Father."

The doctrine of redemption is used to orient believers in time of
stress.

Job 19:25, "I know that my Redeemer liveth..."

At the point of redemption we can have peace of mind, stability, a
relaxed mental attitude by knowing the doctrine and that God has paid
for and provided for everything.

Regeneration
------------

Regeneration is the theological term for the Christian’s “new” or
“second” birth in Christ. By definition, regeneration is the act of God
by which He imparts divine life to man upon the single condition of
faith in Jesus Christ as personal Savior. Several words and phrases in
the Bible express the concept of regeneration. The following passages
show how frequently the doctrine of regeneration is found in the Bible.

In John 3:7 the words “born again” express regeneration.

In Eph. 2:5, the words “made alive” refer to regeneration, the new life

In 2 Cor. 5:17, the words “new creation” speak of the new birth

In 1 John 3:1,2, the expression “children of God” refers to
regeneration.

In Titus 3:5, the word “regeneration” itself is used.

There are several aspects about regeneration which are important to give
attention to.

All People Need Regeneration

Our condition demands it. Eph. 2:1 declares us to be “dead” in sins.
Death is a condition for which “life” (regeneration) is the only
solution.

Out family connection demands it. Rom. 5:12 indicates that we are dead
because of a family relationship. Therefore, we need a new birth, a new
family, a new Father, all of which are provided by regeneration.

The Author of Regeneration: GOD

John 1:12 informs us that we must be “born of God.” The word “of” points
to the source and origin of the new life - God is the origin and source
of regeneration.

John 1:13 eliminates all human aspects of regeneration. The phrase “not
of blood” shows that regeneration cannot be inherited. The phrase “not
of the will of the flesh” shows that God’s life is not the fruit of a
man’s search for God. “Not of the will of man” - man cannot generate
eternal life.

The Means of Regeneration - The Word

1 Pet. 1:23 makes it clear that the written word of God is the means of
the new birth, because the written word is actually the living Word (see
also Heb. 4:12; John 6:63; Acts 7:38) In practice, this means knowledge
must precede the new birth. The miracle of the new birth cannot occur
where the Word of God is not taught in some form.

The Power of Regeneration - The Resurrection

We are “born again...by the resurrection of Jesus Christ”, 1 Pet. 1:3.
This shows us the kind of power needed for regeneration. According to
Eph. 1:19,20 the power that raised Christ from the dead is the greatest
power ever displayed. This same power is applied in bringing
regeneration to us.

The Instrument of Regeneration - Faith

Gal. 3:26 explains that faith is the hand by which we receive the gift
of eternal life.

The Basis of Regeneration - Blood

Those who call on the Father, 1 Pet. 1:1719, the family concept of
regeneration. It is the blood of Christ that makes this possible (v.
19).

The Agent of Regeneration - The Holy Spirit

John 3:5,6, the necessity of birth through the agency of the Holy
Spirit. “Flesh” begets “flesh”, “spirit” begets “spirit”. Divine life
requires divine parents.

John 1:12 “...to them gave He power to become the children of God”

Salvation Doctrines
-------------------

[The main truths of this topical study are in the Scriptures that are
called out in the paragraphs below. The student should be sure to study
all the Bible passages cited, along with their contexts.]

The Christian life begins the moment a person believes the Gospel,
putting his complete confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation.
At that moment, God provides the new believer with a great number of
unique and permanent blessings. "...and hath blessed us with all
spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." (Eph. 1:3) These
blessings are a part of the inheritance of the believer, those useful
doctrines and promises upon which the Christian may draw during the
remainder of his lifetime on earth.

The following is a listing of Salvation Doctrines, a catalogue of the
things God does for the believer at the moment of salvation. These basic
ideas are the underlying principles for the mechanics of Christian
living, the techniques such as FaithRest and Occupation with Christ.
These doctrines are also foundation principles for all other Bible
doctrine.

This listing can provide you with hours of quality study and meditation.
You may well find other topics that could be added to the list. It is
valuable and important that a Christian understand thoroughly his
relationship with the Lord; and a good knowledge of these doctrines can
be of great help in Christian living.

Use the items on this list with people who don't believer in eternal
security. You see, in order for God to take salvation away from anyone,
He would have to reverse every one of these processes. Item \#18, for
example, shows that a Christian is a gift from God the Father to His
Son. Loss of salvation would mean that God would take back His gift to
His own Son. Or, in \#35, we see that the believer receives a Human
Spirit as part of the salvation package. Losing salvation would mean
that the Human Spirit would have to be killed, or removed in some way.
In a similar way you can argue in favor of eternal security from every
one of these items.

You can also use these topics in your personal witness to novice
Christians. Remember, these are "Day One" doctrines. So the new believer
(or the "old baby" believer) cannot begin to mature until he begins to
grasp the importance of these topics. Advanced believers are responsible
to spoon feed basic teaching to untaught believers.

Servants of God
---------------

God commands Christians to be faithful and obedient servants.

Deut. 10:12 "And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of
thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love
him, and to serve the Lord with all thy heart and with all thy soul."

Micah 6:8 "He hath shown thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the
Lord required of thee, but to do justly and to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God?"

Psalm 100:2 "Serve the Lord with gladness; come before his presence with
singing."

JOSH. 24:14,15

Service is to be rendered as unto the Lord Jesus Christ.

JOHN 12:23-26

Col. 3:24 "Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ."

The believer’s service is to be rendered to people.

Christian service makes life noble.

Mark 10:43,44 "But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be
great among you, shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be
the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of Man came not
to be ministered unto, but to minister."

Christian service exemplifies neighborliness.

LUKE 10:36,37

Christian service is Christ-like.

JOHN 13:1-17

Christian service demonstrates love.

JOHN 21:15-17

Christian service lightens life's burdens.

GAL. 5:13-15

GAL. 6:1-10

ACTS 20:17-20

HEB. 10:23-25

The place of worship and the place of ser-vice. We also "assemble" for
service. The Body functions as a congregation.

As God’s servants, believers have specific responsibilities.

Christians are to leave all to follow Christ.

Phil. 3:7,8 "But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
Christ. Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord; for whom I have
suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I
may win Christ."

Believers are to render undivided service.

1 CHRON. 15:10-15

1 Sam. 7:3 "And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye
do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the foreign
gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the
Lord, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the
Philistines. Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and
Ashtaroth, and served the Lord only."

Believers are to serve with humility.

ACTS 20:18,19

Believers are to serve with courage.

Deut. 1:17 "Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, but ye shall hear
the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of
man, for the judgment is God's; and the cause that is too hard for you,
bring it unto me [Moses], and I will hear it."

Prov. 29:25 "The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his
trust in the Lord shall be safe."

Examples of faith service

The Lord Jesus Christ served men.

Phil. 2:7 "But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men."

Godly men served the Lord by serving other men.

Peter and Andrew, Mark 1:17,18

Zaccheus, Luke 19:6 ff

Paul, Acts 9:20

The rewards of faithful service

The faithful servant gains spiritual knowledge.

Hos. 6:3 "Then shall we know, Lord; his gome unto us as the rain, as the
latter and former rain unto the earth."

The faithful servant gains divine viewpoint.

John 8:12 "Then spoke Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of
the world; he that followeth me shall not walk darkness, but shall have
the light of life."

The faithful servant has spiritual guidance.

John 10:27 "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow me."

The faithful servant receives honor from God.

John 12:26 "If any man serve me, let him fol-low me; and where I am,
there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father
honor."

The faithful servant has a life of joy.

Psalm 40:8 "I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within
my heart."

John 4:36 "And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
life eternal, that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice
together."

Servants and Slaves in Palestine
--------------------------------

Some people, called "hirelings", were employed for wages in ancient
Palestine (Job 7:1; 14:6; Mark 1:20). But most of the servants of the
Israelites, as well as those of other eastern peoples of Old Testament
times, were slaves or indentured servants - men and women who were held
as property for various reasons and for various lengths of time. Some
slaves were bought from neighboring nations or from foreign residents of
Canaan. Some were captives taken in war. Some were children of slaves
who were born in the house of the master. A slave might himself be a
Hebrew who, through poverty, sold himself into servitude until he got
back on his feet.

Slavery among the Hebrews was usually a mild and merciful system. The
Bible, while it recognizes that slavery exists, does not approve or
disapprove of the practice. Numerous standards were set up in the Law
for the regulation of slavery and servitude, with laws which regulated
both the conditions and the duration of the bondage.

One source of slavery was absolutely forbidden. It was punishable by
death to steal or kidnap a human being for the purpose of making him a
slave or to sell him to someone else as a slave. This regulation applied
to Israelite and foreigner alike.

Deut. 24:7, "If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the
children of Israel, and makes merchandise of him, or sells him; then
that thief shall die; and you shall put evil away from among you."

Exo. 21:16, "And he that steals a man, and sells him, or if he be found
in his hand, he shall be surely put to death."

THE TREATMENT OF SERVANTS

Each Israelite was considered to be a servant of God. Therefore, he was
not to be treated as a bondservant but as a hired worker; and his master
was to rule over him with kindness .

Lev. 25:39-41, "And if thy brother that dwells by thee be waxen poor,
and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
bondservant; But as a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be
with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee: And then shall
he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return
unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he
return."

There were several ways that a Hebrew could become the servant of his
brethren:

The Israelite, through poverty, might become unable to manage his own
affairs or to maintain himself as an independent citizen. In this case
he might pass by sale under the power of another. The passage in Lev.
25:39 ff, which lays down the law in these matters, does not imply that
such a sale was compulsory. It is understood to mean that the individual
sold himself (or rather, he sold the rights to his labor) to another
Jew, so that he might be able to earn subsistence for himself and his
family.

A Hebrew who had been convicted of theft was required to make
restitution to the extent of at least double the value of the amount
stolen if the stolen property itself was recovered). In other cases he
was to pay four or five times as much as he stole (Note the case of
Zacchaeu\~). If the thief could not make the required restitution, he
was sold for his theft and he made restitution by his labor.

Exod. 22:1-3, "If a man shall steal ...If the sun be risen upon him,
there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution;
if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft."

Children of a Hebrew servant became, by condition of their birth, the
servants of the master (Exod. 21:4).

When a man was claimed personally by a creditor, his children were
usually sold into bondage with him. While the impoverished man might
sell himself into servitude, it was only to work off his debt until the
jubilee year. 2 Kings 4:1; Neh. 5:5; Isa. 50:1; Job 24:9.

Every Israelite, male or female, who had become a slave, might be
redeemed at any time by relatives or friends by the payment of what was
owed. In any case, even if he were not redeemed, he was to be released
after six years of service; and he was to be given a present of food and
cattle (Exod. 21:2; Deut. 15:12-15). If he brought a wife into service
with him, she was to be freed with him. However, if his master had
provided him with a wife, the master could require the wife to stay when
the man left. And the children of such a marriage stayed with the master
(Exod. 21:3; Jer. 34:8 ff).

If the Hebrew servant, for love of his wife and children or other
reason, preferred not to accept freedom in the seventh year (or when his
obligation was completed), he was brought before the elders of the
community and had his ear pierced as a token of his willingness to give
lifelong servitude to his master (Exod. 21:6; Deut. 15:17).

If a Jew were to become the slave of a Gentile, the servitude could be
terminated in two ways. First, it could be terminated by the arrival of
the year of jubilee. Second, the servant could be released by payment to
the master of the purchase price LESS the value of the services
rendered, based upon the pay scale of a hired laborer (Lev. 25:47-55).

During the time that the slave was "possessed" by his master, the master
had certain power of disposing of him as he would other articles of
personal property. He could, for example, leave the servant to his
heirs. The servant was said to have a certain monetary value, that is,
his labor had a money value; but he was not supposed to be thought of as
chattel.

A slave could be freed in one of four ways:

By redemption through the payment of money or goods.

By manumission, a bill or ticket of freedom issued by the master.

By testamentary disposition; the master could specify that the slave was
to be freed upon the master's death, for example.

By any act that implied that the slave was a free citizen, such as
making an heir of one's slave.

The Law had several means for the protection of slaves or servants. A
servant was entitled to full religious privilege and access to all
religious functions and practices, such as sacrifices, Passover and
other feasts, circumcision, etc. He was to be given a day of rest on the
Sabbath. He was to receive his liberty if the case of some grievous
injury such as loss of eye or limb. See other passages: Gen. 17:12;
Exod. 12:44; 20:11; 21:20,26,27; Lev. 24:17,22; Deut. 5:14 ff; 12:12,18.

Shepherds of the Flock of God
-----------------------------

1 Peter 5:1,2 "The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an
elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of
the glory that shall be revealed: FEED THE FLOCK of God which is among
you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not
for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind:"

Deuteronomy 8:3, "And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and
fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers
know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only,
but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man
live."

We live by God's Word, that which proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord.
"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus".

And it is our shepherds who have the duty to provide us with this
nourishment, lest we waste away in spiritual malnutrition!

My aim in this article is to provide a thorough introduction to the
Bible concept of shepherding, from Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ as
Shepherd, to the Christian believer who feeds and cares for the "sheep
of His pasture."

Pastors and elders are shepherds. The Greek word (poimeino\~), used a
single time in the New Testament in Ephesians 4:11, is translated
"pastor". On other occasions, such as in 1 Peter 5:2, the verb form
(poimeinw) is translated "to feed". So pastors and elders are "feeders",
and Christians are the "flock" which are to be fed.

I intend in this article to develop a full description of what a
Christian spiritual shepherd is, including a shepherd's qualifications
and duties. This description will be derived from a study of what the
whole Bible says about shepherds, by examining the following:

\* Jehovah as Shepherd

\* The Lord Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd

\* King David as shepherd of his people. He was both a shepherd-boy and
the shepherd of the kingdom of Israel

\* Pastors and elders, including all those who "feed the flock of God"

I think that the Bible passages I cite in this study will demonstrate
that there are well laid out Bible standards for the function of
shepherd, and that when one is known a true shepherd of the sheep,
certain objective criteria have been met.

Titus was given the task of choosing shepherds (elder\~) for the local
congregations on the island of Crete. When choosing a shepherd, it's
important to have a good idea of what God intends a shepherd to be.

To illustrate:

\* A good shepherd puts the needs of the sheep first, and has an abiding
sense of obligation toward them. One who does not know how to care for
sheep, or who neglects sheep, is not a good shepherd.

\* A good shepherd leads sheep to good pasture and water. A person who
does not provide food and water for sheep is not a good shepherd.

\* A good shepherd protects the sheep and sets up defenses against those
who would harm the sheep. An individual who deliberately harms or
frightens sheep is not a good shepherd.

Jehovah as Shepherd

There is a chain of command in Christian affairs. In a chain of command,
such as in a military organization, when one level of command fails to
function properly, the responsibility is taken over by the next higher
level of command.

God the Father, Jehovah, is always watching His sheep; and He is always
ready to take over when the sheep are not being well handled by their
appointed shepherds..

Jeremiah 10:19-22

[ I will show scripture passages to illustrate these ideas, but it's up
to you to examine the whole context of the discussion in any passage I
cite. Be aware that the verses I indicate are only pointers to broader
portions of the Bible that need to be reviewed in context. ]

Suggestion: read the whole book of Jeremiah from the standpoint of
shepherds, good and bad, and their duties toward their "sheep."

Jeremiah 23:1-6

Jeremiah 50:4-19

Psalm 23

Isaiah 44:24-28

Even a heathen king, Cyrus, was named shepherd, to fulfill a specific
function, to contribute to the rebuilding of Jerusalem.

Read Ezekiel 34.

From C. F. Keil, Commentary on Ezekiel

The shepherds of Israel, namely, the political and religious leaders,
have been feeding themselves and neglecting the flock. The flock has
been scattered and has become a prey to wild beasts. The Lord will
remove the bad shepherds from their office.

The Lord will take charge of His own flock, gather it together from
where it is scattered, and feed and tend it on good pasture in the land
of Israel. He will sift the flock by getting rid of the "fat" and
"violent" ones.

He will appoint His servant David shepherd over His flock, make a
covenant of peace with His people, and bless the land with fruitfulness,
so that Israel may dwell there in security, and no more suffer by
internal strife and famine or be carried off by their enemies.

This chapter (Eze. 34) is a repetition and expansion of the prophecy of
Jeremiah 23:1-8. Both prophecies deal with the salvation of Israel and
the fact that the sheep will be gathered and tended by the Lord and His
servant David.

Rev. 7:17, "For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of water: and God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes."

Rev. 12:6, "And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a
place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand, two
hundred, and threescore days."

The Lord Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd

Jesus Christ is presented as the "Good Shepherd" in that He lays down
His life for His sheep. This refers to Christ's saving work on the
cross, the atonement.

In Hebrews 13:20,21, He is called the "great shepherd," a title that
refers to divine blessing to advanced believers.

In 1 Peter 5:4, the title "Chief Shepherd" is the title for Christ as we
face Him after death.

The Lord Jesus provides for His sheep in many ways.

\* The believer, like a sheep, is helpless and has no sense of
direction; a sheep must be guided by a shepherd. We need Bible truth as
our guide in life.

\* A sheep cannot clean itself; this a reminder of our Lord's provision
of cleansing, as shown in 1 John 1:9.

\* A sheep is helpless when injured. So, when we are injured by the
various problems in life, only the Lord can provide the necessary
therapy.

\* A sheep is defenseless; he depends on the shepherd for protection.
The Lord provide the armor of God for protection.

\* A sheep can't find food or water for itself. A sheep must depend on
the shepherd to lead it to water.

\* A sheep is easily frightened or panicked. The shepherd calms the
sheep with songs in the night; i.e. Bible truth in the soul.

\* When the sheep produces wool, it belong to the owner of the flock. It
does not belong to the sheep.

Every Christian is supposed to be "like Christ." Pastors and elders, in
particular, must have the qualities of good shepherd that the Lord Jesus
embodies.

An elder must have the "mind of Christ." This means that, as he grows
into his job as elder, he will become more like Christ in his thinking
and shepherding. If he does not, he will be a bad shepherd.

Matthew 9:35-38

Matthew 25:31-34

Luke 15:4-7

John 10:1-18

John 21:15-17

Keep in mind as we study - the sheep belong to the Lord Jesus Christ.
All through the scriptures that we are studying, the flocks belong to
God. They do not belong to the human shepherd. By illustration, David
was the shepherd for sheep that belonged to his father, Jesse.

In Heb. 13:20, Christ is called "the great Shepherd of the sheep."

1 Peter 2:21-25, "For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also
suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:
who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was
reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but
committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. Who his own self bare
our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins,
should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye
were as sheep going astray, but are now returned unto the Shepherd and
Bishop of your souls."

Matthew 18:10-24

Psalm 78:51-54, "He smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
strength in the tabernacles of Ham: But made his own people to go forth
like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. And he led
them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their
enemies. And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
this mountain, which his right hand had purchased."

Psalm 79:13, "So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee
thanks forever: we will show forth thy praise to all generations."

Isaiah 40:10,11, "Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and
his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work
before him. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead
those that are with young."

If an elder has the mind of Christ, he will have the attitude of Christ
toward his flock and toward his job as shepherd. This is the attitude
and motivation to look for in anyone who aspires to the office of pastor
or elder.

David as the Shepherd of Israel

1 Chronicles 17:3-9

1 Chronicles 21:16,17

In this passage, David takes the responsibility for the poor handling of
his human flock when he numbered the people.

Spiritual Qualifications for an Elder (Shepherd)

The most important function in a church - and the most important
activity that a Christian can engage in - is the study and teaching of
the Word of God. Bible truth is the theoretical and practical support
for every other feature of Christian life, including worship, prayer,
evangelism, missionary service, discipling, and fellowship. Without a
solid foundation in Bible principle and doctrine, a Christian can spend
his life flailing around trying to serve the Lord while never
understanding the basic plan of God for his life and ministry.

In a local church, someone has to teach, to organize things, to arrange
for the activities of the organization, no matter how small. If no
hierarchy is imposed on a community of people, leaders will emerge
anyway, either chosen by the group to take charge, or, by default, to
move into a leadership void.

In the Bible, Christian leaders are not chosen politically, or by
seniority, or by submitting a résumé. An "eldership" is a battlefield
commission; a person tested and proved in battle is seen to be the
natural choice for a position as a bishop or elder.

The most highly decorated American soldier of World War II, Audie
Murphy, received a battlefield commission to 2nd Lieutenant, after he
had proved himself in battle. His leaders had seen in him the qualities
of leadership and proven ability that made him eligible for that honor.
(He was prevented by his physical disability from wounds from attending
the U. S. Military Academy after the war.)

In the Epistle to Titus, the task given to Titus was to observe which
individuals were qualified to be appointed, according to the criteria
Paul outlined.

Chief among these qualifications was that the elder was to "hold to the
faithful word as he had been taught, that he may be able by sound
doctrine to refute and to convince the gainsayers." An elder is
primarily a teacher of the Word of God. If he does not teach his flock
what the Bible says, his sheep will perish of malnourishment!

The qualifications of elders (pastors, bishops, overseers, presbyters,
deacon\~) are given in such passages as 1 Peter 5, Titus 1 and 2, 1
Timothy, and Acts 7.

Think about Titus's job of selecting elders on Crete.

He had to observe men in the communities on Crete and decide whom to
appoint as elder. Maybe he interviewed likely candidates. Maybe he asked
other believers to describe the qualities they say in various people.

It's possible to fake many things in the Christian life. A person can
smile, talk the language of the church he attends, refrain from certain
taboos, and generally fool most of the people most of the time. After
all, we don't go around questioning people to their face about the
genuineness of their profession or claims. If a person claims to love
the Lord and be devoted to Christian service, how can you tell if the
claim is genuine?

Well, there are two things in which it is extremely difficult to fool an
experienced person like Titus. First, it is hard to give the appearance
of having a great love for the Word of God. And second, it is hard to
fool a discerning Christian into believing that one has the fruit of the
Holy Spirit.

Love for the Word of God

When a person genuinely loves the Lord, a love for the Word of God is
naturally accompanies that love. That person will give evidence every
day of immersion in the Bible. After all, the Bible is the communication
of the Lord Jesus, the One loved, and a desire to know the Word, to
meditate in it, and to talk about it, will be just as natural as a young
person's total captivation with romance.

In fact, this characteristic can be used to discern the true merits of
any candidate for Christian office. A person can attend church, engage
in worship and Christian service, and use Christian vocabulary. But
there may be some ulterior motive in this.

A young man who is interested in a young woman can readily adapt himself
to her surroundings and seem to be something that he is not. People are
chameleons when trying to impress others. But it is very difficult over
a period of time for a person to establish a reputation as one who is
absorbed by the Word of God, unless the Bible is the center of attention
and devotion.

A Christian who is motivated by a desire for recognition, a lust for
power, or an ambition to have a religious career, can adopt almost any
appearance or conform to any program or set of standards. One of the
most difficult things to fake, however, is an occupation with the Lord
Jesus Christ and His Word.

THE FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

The other thing that is hard to cover up is a lack of the fruit of the
Holy Spirit. But how can you tell when a person is filled with the Holy
Spirit?

The people in Acts 7 were expected to do just that when they selected
the first seven deacons. They were expected to select men to handle this
job, based on just this one qualification. If you had been in that
church, how would you have known whom to vote for?

Would you believe that a man is Spirit-filled because he tells you he
is, or because he says he has had a spiritual experience? Would you be
impressed by a person who is sweet, smiles, and uses spiritual
vocabulary? The outward appearance is easy to counterfeit. When one
person exhibits some genuine spiritual power or ability, it's quite
natural that others will envy that and want to fake it, or buy it (Simon
the Sorcerer)!

But Titus was looking for some very objective evidence of genuine
Christian character in the men he was considering for positions of
responsibility on Crete.

LOVE - The first fruit of the Holy Spirit mentioned in Galatians 5 is
Love.

Titus 1:8 states that an elder is to be "a lover of hospitality":
(philozeno\~); he is to have a love for strangers. This word carries the
connotation of hospitality, of doing something for someone who does not
earn or deserve the good treatment, because there has been no previous
acquaintance. This word reflects a Grace attitude toward people who have
not yet earned one's consideration.

This is a word of impersonal love - the type of attitude that is free of
arrogance, envy, hatred, or even disdain for other people, even if there
is sharp disagreement about doctrine or practice. This is the type of
love that permits a Christian to love even his enemies or people that he
doesn't like.

There is no envy, self-righteousness, or sinful judging accompanying
this love. There will be no hatred, maligning, or malicious gossip
involved in this love.

This is the type of love that is the fruit of the Holy Spirit. It does
not come from emotion, although it may cause emotion. This is the
"professional" love of the mature Christian believer, analogous to the
Love of God, the quality of which does not depend on the behavior or
character of the one being loved, but on the character of the one who
loves.

Some examples:

JOY - Joy is the happiness which God provides, a happiness that does not
depend on people, circumstances, or things to maintain it. Joy is the
relaxed mental attitude that comes from casting one's cares on Christ,
knowing that He cares for us. A person who does not possess spiritual
joy will chase after the world's attractions and provisions because
there is no satisfaction in the things of the Lord.

PEACE - Peace is the result of exercising Faith-Rest. Faith-Rest is the
process of trusting God the Father to keep his promises, to make
provision for every contingency and trial, and then enjoying the
tranquillity that abiding in Christ provides. A person without godly
peace will fret and stew, try to solve problems in flesh, and will
generally exhibit the same anxieties as the unbeliever in the same
position.

PATIENCE - the long view; the quality that results from having
eternity's value in view, of being occupied with Christ, of living in
the Word of God, and of knowing what God's plan is and how it is working
out in the life. The impatient person wants things now and will avidly
pursue "things", not being willing to wait for the Lord to provide or
promote.

The Elder's Professional Qualifications

An elder must be an accomplished instructor of the Word of God. There
are many other duties of elders, especially of those who are overseers,
such as priests, pastors, bishops; but the underlying basic
responsibility is that of teaching - feeding the flock.

To the spiritual character and personal integrity described above must
be added the training and growth in "knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ" that allows the elder, as the chief among edified
believers, to serve as an effective shepherd.

A local church needs at least one person who teaches the Bible with
sufficient quality, and in sufficient quantity, to provide nourishing
spiritual food for the congregation. The teacher needs to have a
thorough knowledge of the Word and the ability to correlate the facts
and doctrines of scripture and make application of those principles to
Christian living.

A Christian needs to know what the Bible says and what it means. A
Christian is supposed to live "by every word that proceeds out of the
mouth of God." There is no substitute in any believers' life for a
thorough overall knowledge of the facts, the doctrines, and the
spiritual principles of the Word. A pastor must be willing and able to
spend the hours studying and teaching that are required.

If there is no shepherd to teach these things, the people will be
hungry.

Sin Nature
----------

The Sin Nature is that part of the essence of the soul acquired at
Adam's fall and subsequently passed on to every person at birth. The Sin
Nature is the center of the soul's rebellion against God. The essence of
the soul contains:

Self-consciousness

Mentality

Volition

Emotion

The Sin Nature

The Essence of the Sin Nature

The Sin Nature has an "area" of strengths in which human good is
produced, that is, those good deeds and thoughts which are acceptable to
man but which are unacceptable to God for purposes of salvation or
spiritual growth. Isa. 64:6; Rom. 8:8. In the Bible, human good is
contrasted with divine good which is the work produced by the Spirit of
God in the life of a believer who is walking in daily fellowship with
the Lord under the control of the Holy Spirit.

The Sin Nature also has an "area" of weakness which directs the
production of all personal sin. Heb. 12:1. Three types of personal sin
are produced here: mental attitude sins, sins of the tongue, and open
sinful activity.

The Sin Nature has patterns of lusts, or desires, the basic motivators
of all the activities of human life. The basic drives include the desire
for power, approbation, ego satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, material
satisfaction, and so forth.

Trends in the Sin Nature

The Sin Nature has a system of trends, or inclinations, which vary among
individuals. Some people have an inclination toward immorality or
lasciviousness. Rom. 1. Others have trends toward morality or
asceticism. Either trend is a product of Sin Nature activity.

The trends of the old sin nature are derived from the individual lust
pattern. There are certain areas in which we lust, and other areas where
we do not.

The trends of the old sin nature are classified in two categories,
legalism and lasciviousness.

Legalism unrestrained results in moral degeneracy.

Lasciviousness unrestrained results in immoral degeneracy.

Both trends in the old sin nature result in distortion and erroneous
conclusions.

For example, moral degeneracy with its self-righteousness and
self-vindication is often mistaken for the Christian way of life. People
who are morally degenerate are often considered to be great Christians.

Morality originates from the laws of divine establishment, designed for
the entire human race. Morality is designed for both believer and
unbeliever.

Anything the unbeliever can do is not a part of the Christian way of
life. The Christian way of life is a supernatural way of life and
demands a supernatural means of execution, i.e., the filling of the Holy
Spirit.

Virtue supersedes morality in the protocol plan of God. But if your
trend is toward legalism, people assume you're a great Christian.

There is also a distortion involving those with a trend toward
lasciviousness.

Christians say such a person cannot do "those things” and still be a
Christian.

Immoral degeneracy, with its fornication, violence, terrorism, murder,
dope addiction, are construed as not being Christian.

So in the first distortion, people think that if you're very moral
you're living the Christian life. In the second distortion, people think
that if you raise hell you're probably not a Christian at all.
Legalistic shock concludes it must have been a "head belief and not a
heart belief.”

Born-again believers still possess an old sin nature and still commit
sins. If the believer has a trend toward legalism, he will commit sins
related to moral degeneracy. If the believer has a trend toward
lasciviousness, he will commit sins related to immoral degeneracy .

When born-again believers commit sins related to immoral degeneracy,
they're judged by their Christian peers as being not really saved. They
erroneously allege, "a person cannot do such things and be saved.”

What determines the reality of one's salvation is personal faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ, not the category of one's sins .

The believer out of fellowship, living in the cosmic system, can
actually commit any sin that his unbeliever counterpart would commit,
i.e., an unbeliever with a compatible old sin nature.

Bible Synonyms for the Sin Nature

There are several terms used in scripture to refer to what is known as
the Sin Nature.

Sin (in the singular) -- Ps. 51:5; Rom. 5:12; 7:14; 1 John 1:8.

Flesh -- the emphasis here is on the location of the Sin Nature in the
"flesh" or life of the individual. Rom. 8:8; 7:18; 13:14; Gal. 5:16-21;
Eph. 2.3.

Old Man -- referring to the the believer's for-mer manner of life as an
unbeliever. Eph. 4:22; Col. 3:5–9.

Heart -- in some usages the word "heart" refers to a facet of the soul
which is the source of sin. Jer. 17:9; Mt. 12:34; 15:19; Mark 7:21-23;
Ps. 58:2-5.

Carnality -- derived from the Latin for "flesh". Rom. 7:14; 8:6-8; 1
Cor. 3:1-3.

Principles Related to the Sin Nature

The Sin Nature is the source of spiritual death. Rom. 5:12; Eph. 2:1,5.

The Sin Nature is perpetuated in human beings through physical birth.
Ps. 51:5; 1 Tim. 2:13,14. The believer continues to have his Sin Nature
after salvation. 1 Cor. 3:1; 1 John 1:8. The believer under the control
of the Sin Nature is called "carnal". Rom. 7:14; 1 Cor. 3:1ff

The Sin Nature frustrates the production of divine good. Rom. 7:15.

The Sin Nature is not found in the believer's resurrection body. 1 Cor.
15:56; Phil. 3:21; Col. 3:4; 1 Thess. 5:23.

Solutions to the Problem of the Sin Nature

God has arranged to provide all that is needed to deal with the problems
caused by the Sin Nature in a believer's life. The personal sins of the
individual were borne by Jesus Christ on the Cross. 1 Pet. 2:24. These
sins will never be mentioned again because they have already been judged
in Christ. Rev. 20:12.

Furthermore, Jesus Christ rejected the human good produced by the Sin
Nature in terms of its use as "currency" to purchase salvation, Eph.
2:8,9. This made the way clear for God to provide salvation by grace.
The unbeliever will be at the Great White Throne judgment because of his
rejection of this grace provision. Rev. 20:11-15.

The believer's sins were borne on the Cross by the Lord, as were those
of all people. 2 Cor. 5:21. When a believer sins, Satan accuses him in
heaven. Jesus Christ is our Advocate; He pleads our case, and the case
is thrown out of court.

God has provided confession of sin as a means of restoring the broken
fellowship with God caused by the believer's personal sin. The believer
can repent and confess and be filled with the Spirit. 1 John 1:9; Prov.
1:23.

Human good, rejected by Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:8,9), is never acceptable
to God, and it does not produce blessing in the life of the believer. It
is contrary to the principle of Grace, in which God does the work. In
Christian growth, the Holy Spirit provides for the production of divine
good in the believer's life, through His filling, control, and teaching
functions. God does the giving; man does the receiving.

Legalism is human good production for the purpose of earning and
receiving merit or blessing from God. In Legalism, man does the work and
receives the credit. Therefore, Legalism is a product of the Sin Nature
lust patterns. Under Grace, God does the work and receives the "credit"
(glory). Human good production of the Sin Nature will be judged at the
Judgment Seat of Christ. It is called "wood, hay, and stubble" and will
be burned. The "gold, silver, and precious stones", of divine good
production of the Holy Spirit, will remain. 1 Cor. 3:10-15 to him at
sixteen drachmae...”

Sins of the Tongue
------------------

READ Psalm 64:1-10.

Sins of the tongue have their origin in the Sin Nature. These sins are
among the most devastating of all of the categories of sin. Of the seven
sins mentioned in Proverbs 6:16-19 as being especially hated by God,
three are sins of the tongue. As a Christian believer, you must learn as
much as possible about this type of sin. And you must do everything
possible to gain victory over this in order to be able to make progress
in the Christian Way of Life.

PSALM 34:11-14.

Sins of the tongue are motivated by mental sins such as arrogance,
jealousy, bitterness, vindictiveness, implacability, hatred, mental
adultery, pettiness, envy, guilt feelings, etc.

All of these sins are focused at other people at one time or another.
When someone reaches out to attack another person, the tongue is used to
voice the inner mental sins which are already present. Such talk may be
direct and scathing, even vulgar. Or the talk may be subtle, refined,
intellectual, even couched in Christian terms. "There is a matter that I
need to share with you as a prayer request; this is just between us
spiritual believers..."

NOTE : If you know something bad about a person, or you suspect
something, do not share it with anyone unless both you and that person
have a direct responsibility in the solution of the problem. If in
doubt, don't talk about it!

Sins of the tongue are a sign of the believer's reverting to the old way
of life, the condition of the carnal man. James 4:11; 5:9; 5:12, Romans
3:13,14. In fact, the believer who indulges in sins of the tongue cannot
be distinguished from an unbeliever. The believer is warned in Ephesians
4 not to fall into the life patterns of the unbeliever.

EPH. 4:17-22, 25, 29-32.

Verbal sins can destroy a family or a congregation. Things like gossip,
slander, maligning, judging, backbiting, and boasting are malicious,
venal, and destructive. James 3:5,6. Troublemakers are always
characterized by sins of the tongue. Psalm 52:2. It is the duty of the
pastor to warn against these things. 2 Tim. 2:14-17.

And believers are commanded to separate themselves from such
troublemakers. Rom. 16:17,18. This separation may be just a turning away
or refusal to comment or to reply in a conversation. Separation does not
mean ostracism or excommunication except in the worst cases. It means,
at first, refusal to participate. Teaching on this topic may involve
exhortation and rebuke, as in Titus 2:15. But such teaching, plus the
refusal of believers to participated in sins of the tongue, will help
the one who is having trouble with this to have victory.

Sins of the tongue produce compounded divine discipline. Ps. 64:8; Matt.
7:1,2. First, there is discipline for the mental attitude sin which
motivates the verbal sin. Second, there is discipline for the verbal sin
itself. Third, there is discipline for the sins which one assigns to
another person in wrongly judging him - "with what measure you mete, it
shall be measured to you again."

Types of Sins of the Tongue

Backbiting - slander, defamation of character, evil speech, detraction.
Found in several places in the Bible, including Rom. 1:30 as one of the
sins of the immoral person who has rejected God. READ Psalm 15:3; 50:20;
101:5; Proverbs 25:23; Jer. 9:4; Rom. 1:30; 2 Cor. 12:20.

False Witness - lying about people, especially while under oath. Prov.
25:28; Exo. 32:1; Prov. 19:9. Examples of false witness:

- Against Stephen, Acts. 6:11

- Against Paul, Acts 25:7

- Against Christ, Matthew and Mark

Perjury - lying under oath. READ Lev. 6:3; 19:12; Zech. 5:4; Mal. 3:5; 1
Tim. 1:10

Lying - READ Prov. 12:22; 21:6; Col. 3:9; Lev. 19:11; Luke 20:20.

Dissimulation - Faking it, covering up, hypocrisy. Example: calling in
sick when not sick. READ 1 Sam. 21:13; Acts 23:12-15; 2 Sam. 14:2; 2
Kings 10:19; Luke 20:20.

Busybody - self-appointed monitor, or one who tries to straighten others
out. This word appears as a translation of several Greek originals.

From (periergo\~), verb. (periergomai) "to do something useless or
unnecessary". Literally, "to work around". Also used in Greek to mean
"undue anxiety" over something which is not really a proper concern.

Also from (allotroepiskopo\~), a combining form from (allotro\~)
"belonging to another", and (episkopo\~) "bishop". Hence, the busybody
is "another man's bishop".

1 PET. 4:15.

Talebearing - slandering, whispering behind backs. Prov. 11:13; 17:9;
18:8

Evil Whispering - Prov. 16:28.

Slander - Psalm 101:5; 50:20; Prov. 10:18; 11:9; 2 Sam. 10:3; Job 1:11;
Luke 7:33.

False Accusation - READ 1 Sam. 1:14; Neh. 6:7; Job 2:5; 22:6; Jer.
33:17; Matt. 5:11; 27:12; Luke 6:7; 1 Peter 3:16.

Evil Speaking - READ Ps. 5:9; 10:7; 36:3; 55:21: Prov. 12:18; 24:2;
Matt. 12:34; Rom. 3:13; James 3:6; 4:11.

God provides protection for the believer who is, himself, a victim of
sins of the tongue. Job. 5:19–21.

Control of the tongue, the absence of verbal sins, is a sign of
Christian edification in the believer, and it is a sign of considerable
growth in Grace. James 3:2; 4:11,12. By avoiding sins of the tongue, the
Christian can lengthen his life and find great happiness. Ps. 34:12,13.

How to Have Victory Over Sins of the Tongue

​1. Grow daily in conformity with the Lord Jesus Christ

​2. Ask God the Father for provision and protection in this area.

​3. Confess this sin each time you are convicted of it.

​4. Learn to recognize all of the verbal sins -- some are obvious, some
are subtle.

​5. Keep silent during discussion of a bad situation.

​6. Keep silent during discussion of another person.

​7. Keep silent.

Advice: Do not pass on derogatory or uncomplimentary information about
anyone, unless you have the specific authority and responsibility to do
so, and the person you are informing has responsibility in the situation
and a need-to-know the information.

Union with Christ (Positional Truth)
------------------------------------

At the time of his personal salvation, the Christian believer enters
into a spiritual union with Jesus Christ and remains in that position
forever. "Positional Truth" is the formal title for that wide class of
Bible teaching on the subject of the Christian's position in (union
with) Jesus Christ.

Union with Christ makes available to the believer a great number of
spiritual benefits. These benefits can be used and enjoyed continuously
during the believer's remaining lifetime and will continue into
eternity.

The nature of the believer's position in Christ was foretold by the Lord
Jesus Himself: (1) in the Bread of Life discourse, JOHN 6:56; (2) in the
Good Shepherd discourse, JOHN 10:16; and (3) in the Upper Room
discourse, JOHN 14:20.

The Christian is placed spiritually in Christ through a mechanism known
as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. These mechanics are described in 1
COR. 12:13 and GAL. 3:27,28. (A study of the seven baptisms of the Bible
is a prerequisite to an understanding of the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit.)

The Baptism of the Holy Spirit was foretold by Christ in ACTS 1:5,8.
This occurred for the first time on the Day of Pentecost, ACTS 2:1–4 cf.
11:15,16. Therefore, Union with Christ was experienced by believers for
the first time on the Day of Pentecost, making it an experience unique
to Church Age believers.

Union with Christ is a fact for all believers, spiritual or carnal. 1
COR. 1:2; cf. 1:11; 3:1–4

The believer's position in Christ makes him a "new creature" in Christ,
2 COR. 5:17.

The Christian is "in Christ" and has become a "new creature" in that he
has a new birth, a new human spirit, and has the ability now to have
fellowship with God. "Old things have passed away", spiritual death is
done away, and "all things are become new", spiritual life is begun.

Union with Christ has several immediate results for every believer:

Regeneration: TITUS 3:5; JOHN 3:5,6; EPH. 2:1-5.

The Indwelling Holy Spirit: 1COR. 6:19

The Sealing of the Holy Spirit: EPH. 1:13; 4:30.

The Baptism of the Holy Spirit: 1 COR. 12:13.

Spiritual Gifts: 1 COR. 12:11.

The following is a list of the characteristics of the believer's Union
with Christ:

Union with Christ is a fact, not an experience. One is united with
Christ regardless of how he feels.

Union with Christ is not progressive; it cannot be improved upon; we
receive it in total at salvation.

Union with Christ is not commanded by God; it is given by God at
salvation.

This Union is permanent; it will never be taken away; it does not depend
upon our faithfulness; it depends on the faithfulness of God.

This doctrine can be understood only with a thorough study of the
related Bible passages.

Union with the Lord Jesus Christ is a guarantee of eternal security,
ROM. 8:35–39; 1 JOHN 5:11,12; ROM. 8:1.

Union with Christ is current in that the believer is identified with
Christ in His life and shares with Christ in certain aspects of His
life, Eph. 3:1-14.

We share in His election, EPH. 1:4.

We share in His destiny, EPH. 1:5,11.

We share in His sonship, EPH. 1:5; HEB. 2:10; GAL. 3:26.

We obtain the +Righteousness of Christ, 2 COR. 5:21.

We share in Christ's inheritance, ROM. 8:16,17; GAL. 4:7.

We share in His holiness, 1 COR. 1:30.

We share His priesthood, 1 PET. 2:5,9.

We share in His Kingdom, COL. 1:13; 2 PET. 1:11.

We share in His resurrection, EPH. 2:6.

We share in His life, EPH. 2:5; COL. 2:13; 1 JOHN 5:11,12.

In Him we have redemption and forgiveness of sins, EPH. 1:7; COL. 1:14.

Union with Christ makes every believer equal at the point of salvation,
GAL. 3:27,28.

Union with Christ makes the believer perfect in the sight of God, COL.
2:9,10.

Bible Illustrations of Union with Christ

Vine and Branches, JOHN 15

Head and Body, EPH. 1:22,23

Bridegroom and Bride, REV. 19:7-9; 21:9; EPH. 5:27

Shepherd and Flock, JOHN 10:16

Chief cornerstone and building, 1 PET. 2:4,5

High Priest and Priesthood, HEB. 4:14; 5:5,6,10, cf. 1 PETER 2:5

Union with Christ is the doctrinal basis for spirituality, ROM. 6:1-13.

Union with Christ is the basis for the spiritual technique of occupation
with Christ, COL. 3:1-4.

Union with Christ is illustrated by and testified to by water baptism.
The believer is identified with Christ in His death, burial, and
resurrection.

Appendix B. On the Date of the Pastoral Epistles
================================================

Before we can fix the time at which these Epistles [1 Timothy, 2
Timothy, Titus] were written, we must take the following data into
account.

​1. The three Epistles were nearly co-temporaneous with one another.
This is proved by their resembling each other in language, matter, and
style of composition, and in the state of the Christian Church which
they describe: and by their differing in all the three points from all
the other Epistles of St. Paul. Of course the full force of this
argument cannot be appreciated by those who have not carefully studied
these Epistles; but it is now almost universally admitted by all who
have done so, both by the defenders and impugners of the authenticity of
the Pastoral Epistles. Hence, if we fix the date of one of the three, we
fix approximately the date of all.

​2. They were written \*after\* St. Paul became acquainted with Apollos,
and therefore \*after\* St. Paul's first visit to Ephesus. (See Acts
28:24 and Titus 3:3).

​3. Hence, they could not have been written till after the conclusion of
that portion of his life which is related in the Acts; because there is
no part of his history, between his first visit to Ephesus and his Roman
imprisonment, which satisfies the historical conditions implied in the
statements of any one of these Epistles. Various attempts have been
made, with different degrees of ingenuity, to place the Epistles to
Timothy and Titus at different points in this interval of time; but all
have failed even to satisfy the conditions required for placing any
single Epistle correctly. And no one has ever attempted to place all
three \*together\*, at any period of St. Paul's life before the end of
his first Roman imprisonment; yet this co-temporaneousness of the three
Epistles is a necessary condition of the problem.

​4. The Pastoral Epistles were written not merely after St. Paul's first
Roman imprisonment, but \*considerably\* after it. This is evident from
the marked difference in their style from the Epistle to the
Philippians, which was the last written during that imprisonment. So
great a change of style (a change not merely in the use of single words,
but in phrases, in modes of thought, and in method of composition) must
require an interval of certainly not less than four or five years to
account for it. And even that interval might seem too short, unless
accompanied by circumstances which should further explain the
alteration. Yet five years of exhausting labour, great physical and
moral sufferings, and bitter experience of human nature, might suffice
to account for the change.

​5. The development of Church organisation implied in the Pastoral
Epistles leads to the same conclusion as to the lateness of their date.
The detailed rules for the choice of presbyters and deacons, implying
numerous candidates for these offices; the exclusion of new converts
(neophyte\~) from the presbyterate; the regular catalogue of Church
widows (1 Tim. 5:9; are all examples of this.

​6. The Heresies condemned in all three Epistles are likewise of a
nature which forbids the supposition of an early data. They are of the
same class as those attacked in the Epistle to the Colossians, but
appear under a more matured form. They are apparently the same heresies
which we find condemned in other portions of Scripture written in the
latter part of the Apostolic age, as, for example, the Epistles of Peter
and Jude. We trace distinctly the beginnings of the Gnostic Heresy,
which broke out with such destructive power in the second century, and
of which we have already seen the germ in the Epistle to the Colossians.

​7. The preceding conditions might lead us to place the Pastoral
Epistles at any point after AD 66, i.e., in the last thirty-three years
of the first century. But we have a limit assigned us in this direction,
by a fact mentioned in the Epistles to Timothy, viz., that Timotheus was
still a young man (1 Tim. v:2; 2 Tim 2:22) when they were written. We
must, of course, understand this statement relatively to the
circumstances under which it is used: Tomotheus was young for the
authority entrusted to him; he was young to exercise supreme
jurisdiction over all the Presbyters (many of them old men) of the
Churches of Asia. According to even modern notions (and much more
according to the feelings of antiquity on the subject), he would still
have been very young for such a position at the age of thirty-five.

Now Timotheus was (as we have seen, pp. 156 and 203) a youth still
living with his parents when St. Paul first took him in AD 51 as his
companion (Acts 16:1-3). From the way in which he is then mentioned
(compare with 2 Tim. 1:4), we cannot imagine him to have been more than
seventeen or eighteen at the most. Nor, again could he be much younger
than this, considering the part he soon afterwards took in the
conversion of Macedonia (2 Cor. 1:19). Hence we may suppose him to have
been eighteen years old in AD 51. Consequently, in AD 68 (the last year
of Nero), he would be thirty-five years old.

​8. If we are to believe the universal tradition of the early Church,
St. Paul's martyrdom occurred in the reign of Nero. Hence, we have
another limit for the date of the Pastoral Epistles, viz., that it could
not have been later than AD 68, and this agrees very well with the
preceding datum.

It will be observed that all the above conditions are satisfied by the
hypothesis adopted in Chapter XXVII, that the Pastoral Epistles were
written, the first two just before, and the last during, St. Paul's
final imprisonment in Rome.
