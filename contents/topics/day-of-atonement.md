Commentary on Leviticus 16, from *Commentary on the Old Testament*,
C. F. Keil and F. Delitzsch

**Leviticus 16**

The sacrifices and purifications enjoined thus far did
not suffice to complete the reconciliation between the congregation of
Israel, which was called to be a holy nation, but in its very nature was
still altogether involved in sin and uncleanness, and Jehovah the Holy
One,—that is to say, to restore the perfect reconciliation and true
vital fellowship of the nation with its God, in accordance with the idea
and object of the old covenant,—because, even with the most scrupulous
observance of these directions, many sins and defilements would still
remain unacknowledged, and therefore without expiation, and would
necessarily produce in the congregation a feeling of separation from its
God, so that it would be unable to attain to the true joyousness of
access to the throne of grace, and to the place of reconciliation with
God. This want was met by the appointment of a yearly general and
perfect expiation of all the sins and uncleanness which had remained
unatoned for and uncleansed in the course of the year. In this respect
the laws of sacrifice and purification received their completion and
finish in the institution of the festival of atonement, which provided
for the congregation of Israel the highest and most comprehensive
expiation that was possible under the Old Testament. Hence the law
concerning the day of atonement formed a fitting close to the ordinances
designed to place the Israelites in fellowship with their God, and raise
the promise of Jehovah, “I will be your God,” into a living truth. This
law is described in the present chapter, and contains (1) the
instructions as to the performance of the general expiation for the year
(vv. 2–28), and (2) directions for the celebration of this festival
every year (vv. 29–34). From the expiation effected upon this day it
received the name of *“day of expiations,”* i.e., of the highest
expiation (Leviticus 23:27). The Rabbins call it briefly יֹומָא, the day
κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν.

**Leviticus 16:1, 2.** The chronological link connecting the following
law with the death of the sons of Aaron (Leviticus 10:1–5) was intended,
not only to point out the historical event which led to the appointment
of the day of atonement, but also to show the importance and holiness
attached to an entrance into the inmost sanctuary of God. The death of
Aaron’s sons, as a punishment for wilfully “drawing near before
Jehovah,” was to be a solemn warning to Aaron himself, “not to come at
all times into the holy place within the vail, before the mercy-seat
upon the ark,” i.e., into the most holy place (see Ex. 25:10ff.), but
only at the time to be appointed by Jehovah, and for the purposes
instituted by Him, i.e., according to vv. 29ff., only once a year, on
the day of atonement, and only in the manner prescribed in vv. 3ff.,
that he might not die.—“For I will appear in the cloud above the
capporeth.” The cloud in which Jehovah appeared above the capporeth,
between the cherubim (Ex. 25:22), was not the cloud of the incense, with
which Aaron was to cover the capporeth on entering (v. 13), as
*Vitringa, Bähr,* and others follow the Sadducees in supposing, but the
cloud of the divine glory, in which Jehovah manifested His essential
presence in the most holy place above the ark of the covenant. Because
Jehovah appeared in this cloud, not only could no unclean and sinful man
go before the capporeth, i.e., approach the holiness of the all-holy
God; but even the anointed and sanctified high priest, if he went before
it at his own pleasure, or without the expiatory blood of sacrifice,
would expose himself to certain death. The reason for this prohibition
is to be found in the fact, that the holiness communicated to the priest
did not cancel the sin of his nature, but only covered it over for the
performance of his official duties, and so long as the law, which
produced only the knowledge of sin and not its forgiveness and removal,
was not abolished by the complete atonement, the holy God was and
remained to mortal and sinful man a consuming fire, before which no one
could stand.

**Leviticus 16:3–5.** Only בְּזֹאת, *“with this,”* i.e., with the
sacrifices, dress, purifications, and means of expiation mentioned
afterwards, could he go into “the holy place,” i.e., according to the
more precise description in v. 2, into the inmost division of the
tabernacle, which is called *Kodesh hakkadashim,* “the holy of holies,”
in Ex. 26:33. He was to bring an ox (bullock) for a sin-offering and a
ram for a burnt-offering, as a sacrifice for himself and his house
(i.e., the priesthood, v. 6), and two he-goats for a sin-offering and a
ram for a burnt-offering, as a sacrifice for the congregation. For this
purpose he was to put on, not the state-costume of the high priest, but
a body-coat, drawers, girdle, and head-dress of white cloth (*bad:* see
Ex. 28:42), having first bathed his body, and not merely his hands and
feet, as he did for the ordinary service, to appear before Jehovah as
entirely cleansed from the defilement of sin (see at Leviticus 8:6) and
arrayed in clothes of holiness. The dress of white cloth was not the
plain official dress of the ordinary priests, for the girdle of that
dress was coloured (see at Ex. 28:39, 40); and in that case the high
priest would not have appeared in the perfect purity of his divinely
appointed office as chief of the priesthood, but simply as the priest
appointed for this day (*v. Hofmann*). Nor did he officiate (as many of
the Rabbins, and also *C. a Lapide, Grotius, Rosenmüller,* and *Knobel*
suppose) as a penitent praying humbly for the forgiveness of sin. For
where in all the world have clear white clothes been worn either in
mourning or as a penitential garment? The emphatic expression, *“these
are holy garments,”* is a sufficient proof that the pure white colour of
all the clothes, even of the girdle, was intended as a representation of
holiness. Although in Ex. 28:2, 4, etc., the official dress not only of
Aaron, but of his sons also, that is to say, the priestly costume
generally, is described as “holy garments,” yet in the present chapter
the word *kodesh,* “holy,” is frequently used in an emphatic sense (for
example, in vv. 2, 3, 16, of the most holy place of the dwelling), and
by this predicate the dress is characterized as most holy. Moreover, it
was in *baddim* (“linen”) that the angel of Jehovah was clothed (Ezek.
9:2, 3, 11; 10:2, 6, 7, and Dan. 10:5; 12:6, 7), whose whole appearance,
as described in Dan. 10:6, resembled the appearance of the glory of
Jehovah, which Ezekiel saw in the vision of the four cherubim (Ezek. 1),
and was almost exactly like the glory of Jesus Christ, which John saw in
the Revelation (Rev. 1:13–15). The white material, therefore, of the
dress which Aaron wore, when performing the highest act of expiation
under the Old Testament, was a symbolical shadowing forth of the
holiness and glory of the one perfect Mediator between God and man, who,
being the radiation of the glory of God and the image of His nature,
effected by Himself the perfect cleansing away of our sin, and who, as
the true High Priest, being holy, innocent, unspotted, and separate from
sinners, entered once by His own blood into the holy place not made with
hands, namely, into heaven itself, to appear before the face of God for
us, and obtain everlasting redemption (Heb. 1:3; 7:26; 9:12, 24).

**Leviticus 16:6–10.** With the bullock Aaron was to make atonement for
himself and his house. The two he-goats he was to place before Jehovah
(see Leviticus 1:5), and *“give lots over them,”* i.e., have lots cast
upon them, one lot for Jehovah, the other for Azazel. The one upon which
the lot for Jehovah fell (עָלָה, from the coming up of the lot out of
the urn, Josh. 18:11; 19:10), he was to prepare as a sin-offering for
Jehovah, and to present the one upon which the lot for Azazel fell alive
before Jehovah, לְכַפֵּר עָלָיו, *“to expiate it,”* i.e., to make it the
object of expiation (see at v. 21), to send it (them) into the desert to
Azazel. עֲזָאזֵל, which only occurs in this chapter, signifies neither
“a remote solitude,” nor any locality in the desert whatever (as
*Jonathan, Rashi,* etc., suppose); nor the “he-goat” (from עֵז goat, and
עָזַל to turn off, “the goat departing or sent away,” as *Symm.,
Theodot.,* the *Vulgate, Luther,* and others render it); nor “complete
removal” (*Bähr, Winer, Tholuck,* etc.). The words, one lot for Jehovah
and one for Azazel, require unconditionally that *Azazel* should be
regarded as a personal being, in opposition to Jehovah. The word is a
more intense form of עָזַל *removit, dimovit,* and comes from עֲזַלְזֵל
by absorbing the liquid, like *Babel* from *balbel* (Gen. 11:9), and
*Golgotha* from *gulgalta* (*Ewald,* § 158*c*). The Septuagint rendering
is correct, ὁ ἀποπομπαῖος; although in v. 10 the rendering ἀποπομπή is
also adopted, i.e., *“averruncus,* a fiend, or demon whom one drives
away” (*Ewald*). We have not to think, however, of any demon whatever,
who seduces men to wickedness in the form of an evil spirit, as the
fallen angel *Azazel* is represented as doing in the Jewish writings
(Book of Enoch 8:1; 10:10; 13:1ff.), like the terrible field *Shibe,*
whom the Arabs of the peninsula of Sinai so much dread (*Seetzen,* i.
pp. 273–4), but of the devil himself, the head of the fallen angels, who
was afterwards called Satan; for no subordinate evil spirit could have
been placed in antithesis to Jehovah as *Azazel* is here, but only the
ruler or head of the kingdom of demons. The desert and desolate places
are mentioned elsewhere as the abode of evil spirits (Isa. 13:21; 34:14;
Matt. 12:43; Luke 11:24; Rev. 18:2). The desert, regarded as an image of
death and desolation, corresponds to the nature of evil spirits, who
fell away from the primary source of life, and in their hostility to God
devastated the world, which was created good, and brought death and
destruction in their train.

**Leviticus 16:11–20.** He was then to slay the bullock of the
sin-offering, and make atonement for himself and his house (or family,
i.e., for the priests, v. 33). But before bringing the blood of the
sin-offering into the most holy place, he was to take *“the filling of
the censer* (*machtah,* a coal-pan, Ex. 25:38) *with fire-coals,”* i.e.,
as many burning coals as the censer would hold, from the altar of
burnt-offering, and *“the filling of his hands,”* i.e., two hands full
of *“fragrant incense”* (Ex. 30:34), and go with this within the vail,
i.e., into the most holy place, and there place the incense upon the
fire before Jehovah, *“that the cloud of* (burning) *incense might cover
the capporeth above the testimony, and he might not die.”* The design of
these instructions was not that the holiest place, the place of
Jehovah’s presence, might be hidden by the cloud of incense from the
gaze of the unholy eye of man, and so he might separate himself
reverentially from it, that the person approaching might not be seized
with destruction. But as burning incense was a symbol of *prayer,* this
covering of the capporeth with the cloud of incense was a symbolical
covering of the glory of the Most Holy One with prayer to God, in order
that He might not see the sin, nor suffer His holy wrath to break forth
upon the sinner, but might graciously accept, in the blood of the
sin-offering, the souls for which it was presented. Being thus protected
by the incense from the wrath of the holy God, he was to sprinkle (once)
some of the blood of the ox with his finger, first upon the capporeth
*in front,* i.e., not upon the top of the capporeth, but merely upon or
against the front of it, and then seven times *before* the capporeth,
i.e., upon the ground in front of it. It is here assumed as a matter of
course, that when the offering of incense was finished, he would
necessarily come out of the most holy place again, and go to the altar
of burnt-offering to fetch some of the blood of the ox which had been
slaughtered there.

**Leviticus 16:15.** After this he was to slay the he-goat as a
sin-offering for the nation, for which purpose, of course, he must
necessarily come back to the court again, and then take the blood of the
goat into the most holy place, and do just the same with it as he had
already done with that of the ox. A double sprinkling took place in both
cases, first upon or against the capporeth, and then seven times in
front of the capporeth. The first sprinkling, which was performed once
only, was for the expiation of the sins, first of the high priest and
his house, and then of the congregation of Israel (Leviticus 4:7, and
18); the second, which was repeated seven times, was for the expiation
of the sanctuary from the sins of the people. This is implied in the
words of v. 16*a*, “and so shall he make expiation for the most holy
place, on account of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and on
account of their transgressions with regard to all their sins,” which
refer to both the sacrifices; since Aaron first of all expiated the sins
of the priesthood, and the uncleanness with which the priesthood had
stained the sanctuary through their sin, by the blood of the bullock of
the sin-offering; and then the sins of the nation, and the uncleannesses
with which it had defiled the sanctuary, by the he-goat, which was also
slain as a sin-offering.<sup>36</sup>

**Leviticus 16:16b, 17.** *“And so shall he do to the tabernacle of the
congregation that dwelleth among them.”* (i.e., has its place among
them, Josh. 22:19) *“in the midst of their uncleanness.”* The holy
things were rendered unclean, not only by the sins of those who touched
them, but by the uncleanness, i.e., the bodily manifestations of the sin
of the nation; so that they also required a yearly expiation and
cleansing through the expiatory blood of sacrifice. By *ohel moed,* “the
tabernacle of the congregation,” in vv. 16 and 17, as well as vv. 20 and
33, we are to understand the holy place of the tabernacle, to which the
name of the whole is applied on account of its occupying the principal
space in the dwelling, and in distinction from *kodesh* (the holy),
which is used in this chapter to designate the most holy place, or the
space at the back of the dwelling. It follows still further from this,
that by the altar in v. 18, and also in v. 20 and 33, which is mentioned
here as the third portion of the entire sanctuary, we are to understand
the altar of burnt-offering in the court, and not the altar of incense,
as the Rabbins and most of the commentators assume. This rabbinical view
cannot be sustained, either from Ex. 30:10 or from the context. Ex.
30:10 simply prescribes a yearly expiation of the altar of incense on
the day of atonement; and this is implied in the words “so shall he do,”
in v. 16*b.* For these words can only mean, that in the same way in
which he had expiated the most holy place he was also to expiate the
holy place of the tabernacle, in which the altar of incense took the
place of the ark of the covenant of the most holy place; so that the
expiation was performed by his putting blood, in the first place, upon
the horns of the altar, and then sprinkling it seven times upon the
ground in front of it. The expression “go out” in v. 18 refers, not to
his going out of the most holy into the holy place, but to his going out
of the *ohel moed* (or holy place) into the court.

**Leviticus 16:17.** There was to be no one in the *ohel moed* when
Aaron went into it to make expiation in the most holy place, until he
came out (of the tabernacle) again; not because no one but the chief
servant of Jehovah was worthy to be near or present either as spectator
or assistant at this sacred act before Jehovah (*Knobel*), but because
no unholy person was to defile by his presence the sanctuary, which had
just been cleansed; just as no layman at all was allowed to enter the
holy place, or could go with impunity into the presence of the holy God.

**Leviticus 16:18, 19.** After he had made atonement for the dwelling,
Aaron was to expiate the altar in the court, by first of all putting
some of the blood of the bullock and he-goat upon the horns of the
altar, and then sprinkling it seven times with his finger, and thus
cleansing and sanctifying it from the uncleannesses of the children of
Israel. The application of blood to the horns of the altar was intended
to expiate the sins of the priests as well as those of the nation; just
as in the case of ordinary sin-offerings it expiated the sins of
individual members of the nation (Leviticus 4:25, 30, 34), to which the
priests also belonged; and the sevenfold sprinkling effected the
purification of the place of sacrifice from the uncleannesses of the
congregation.

The meaning of the sprinkling of blood upon the capporeth and the horns
of the two altars was the same as in the case of every sin-offering (see
pp. 509 and 523). The peculiar features in the expiatory ritual of the
day of atonement were the following. In the first place, the blood of
both sacrifices was taken not merely into the holy place, but into the
most holy, and sprinkled directly upon the throne of God. This was done
to show that the true atonement could only take place before the throne
of God Himself, and that the sinner was only then truly reconciled to
God, and placed in the full and living fellowship of peace with God,
when he could come directly to the throne of God, and not merely to the
place where, although the Lord indeed manifested His grace to him, He
was still separated from him by a curtain. In this respect, therefore,
the bringing of the blood of atonement into the most holy place had a
prophetic signification, and was a predictive sign that the curtain,
which then separated Israel from its God, would one day be removed, and
that with the entrance of the full and eternal atonement free access
would be opened to the throne of the Lord. The *second* peculiarity in
this act of atonement was the sprinkling of the blood seven times upon
the holy places, the floor of the holy of holies and holy place, and the
altar of the court; also the application of blood to the media of
atonement in the three divisions of the tabernacle, for the cleansing of
the holy places from the uncleanness of the children of Israel. As this
uncleanness cannot be regarded as consisting of physical defilement, but
simply as the ideal effluence of their sins, which had been transferred
to the objects in question; so, on the other hand, the cleansing of the
holy places can only be understood as consisting in an ideal
transference of the influence of the atoning blood to the inanimate
objects which had been defiled by sin. If the way in which the
sacrificial blood, regarded as the expiation of souls, produced its
cleansing effects was, that by virtue thereof the sin was covered over,
whilst the sinner was reconciled to God and received forgiveness of sin
and the means of sanctification, we must regard the sin-destroying
virtue of the blood as working in the same way also upon the objects
defiled by sin, namely, that powers were transferred to them which
removed the effects proceeding from sin, and in this way wiped out the
uncleanness of the children of Israel that was in them. This
communication of purifying powers to the holy things was represented by
the sprinkling of the atoning blood upon and against them, and indeed by
their being sprinkled seven times, to set forth the communication as
raised to an efficiency corresponding to its purpose, and to impress
upon it the stamp of a divine act through the number seven, which was
sanctified by the work of God in creation.

**Leviticus 16:20–22.** After the completion of the expiation and
cleansing of the holy things, Aaron was to bring up the live goat, i.e.,
to have it brought before the altar of burnt-offering, and placing both
his hands upon its head, to confess all the sins and transgressions of
the children of Israel upon it, and so put them upon its head. He was
then to send the goat away into the desert by a man who was standing
ready, that it might carry all its sins upon it into a land cut off; and
there the man was to set the goat at liberty. עִתִּי, ἁπάξ λεγ. from עֵת
an appointed time, signifies opportune, present at the right time, or
ready. גְּזֵרָה, which is also met with in this passage alone, from
גָּזַר to cut, or cut off, that which is severed, a country cut off from
others, not connected by roads with any inhabited land. “The goat was
not to find its way back” (*Knobel*). To understand clearly the meaning
of this symbolical rite, we must start from the fact, that according to
the distinct words of v. 5, the two goats were to serve as *a*
sin-offering (לְחַטָּאת). They were both of them devoted, therefore, to
one and the same purpose, as was pointed out by the Talmudists, who laid
down the law on that very account, that they were to be exactly alike,
*colore, statura, et valore.* The living goat, therefore, is not to be
regarded merely as the bearer of the sin to be taken away, but as quite
as truly a sin-offering as the one that was slaughtered. It was
appointed לְכַפֵּר עָלָיו (v. 10), i.e., not that an expiatory rite
might be performed over it, for עַל with כַּפֵּר always applies to the
object of the expiation, but properly to expiate it, i.e., to make it
the object of the expiation, or make expiation with it. To this end the
sins of the nation were confessed upon it with the laying on of hands,
and thus symbolically laid upon its head, that it might bear them, and
when sent into the desert carry them away thither. The sins, which were
thus laid upon its head by confession, were the sins of Israel, which
had already been expiated by the sacrifice of the other goat. To
understand, however, how the sins already expiated could still be
confessed and laid upon the living goat, it is not sufficient to say,
with *Bähr,* that the expiation with blood represented merely a covering
or covering up of the sin, and that in order to impress upon the
expiation the stamp of the greatest possible completeness and
perfection, a supplement was appended, which represented the carrying
away and removal of the sin. For in the case of every sin-offering for
the congregation, in addition to the covering or forgiveness of sin
represented by the sprinkling of blood, the removal or abolition of it
was also represented by the burning of the flesh of the sacrifice; and
this took place in the present instance also. As both goats were
intended for a sin-offering, the sins of the nation were confessed upon
both, and placed upon the heads of both by the laying on of hands;
though it is of the living goat only that this is expressly recorded,
being omitted in the case of the other, because the rule laid down in
Leviticus 4:4ff. was followed.<sup>37</sup> By both Israel was delivered
from all sins and transgressions; but by the one, upon which the lot
“for Jehovah” fell, it was so with regard to Jehovah; by the other, upon
which the lot “for Azazel” fell, with regard to Azazel. With regard to
Jehovah, or in relation to Jehovah, the sins were wiped away by the
sacrifice of the goat; the sprinkling of the blood setting forth their
forgiveness, and the burning of the animal the blotting of them out; and
with this the separation of the congregation from Jehovah because of its
sin was removed, and living fellowship with God restored. But Israel had
also been brought by its sin into a distinct relation to Azazel, the
head of the evil spirits; and it was necessary that this should be
brought to an end, if reconciliation with God was to be perfectly
secured. This complete deliverance from sin and its author was
symbolized in the leading away of the goat, which had been laden with
the sins, into the desert. This goat was to take back the sins, which
God had forgiven to His congregation, into the desert to Azazel, the
father of all sin, in the one hand as a proof that his evil influences
upon men would be of no avail in the case of those who had received
expiation from God, and on the other hand as a proof to the congregation
also that those who were laden with sin could not remain in the kingdom
of God, but would be banished to the abode of evil spirits, unless they
were redeemed therefrom. This last point, it is true, is not expressly
mentioned in the test; but it is evident from the fate which necessarily
awaited the goat, when driven into the wilderness in the “land cut off.”
It would be sure to perish out there in the desert, that is to say, to
suffer just what a winner would have to endure if his sins remained upon
him; though probably it is only a later addition, not founded in the
law, which we find in the *Mishnah, Joma* vi. 6, viz., that the goat was
driven headlong from a rock in the desert, and dashed to pieces at the
foot. There is not the slightest idea of presenting a sacrifice to
Azazel. This goat was a sin-offering, only so far as it was laden with
the sins of the people to carry them away into the desert; and in this
respect alone is there a resemblance between the two goats and the two
birds used in the purification of the leper (Leviticus 14:4ff.), of
which the one to be set free was bathed in the blood of the one that was
killed. In both cases the reason for making use of two animals is to be
found purely in the physical impossibility of combining all the
features, that had to be set forth in the sin-offering, in one single
animal.

**Leviticus 16:23–28.** After the living goat had been sent away, Aaron
was to go into the tabernacle, i.e., the holy place of the dwelling, and
there take off his white clothes and lay them down, i.e., put them away,
because they were only to be worn in the performance of the expiatory
ritual of this day, and then bathe his body in the holy place, i.e., in
the court, in the laver between the altar and the door of the dwelling,
probably because the act of laying the sins upon the goat rendered him
unclean. He was then to put on his clothes, i.e., the coloured
state-dress of the high priest, and to offer in this the
burnt-offerings, for an atonement for himself and the nation (see
Leviticus 1:4), and to burn the fat portions of the sin-offerings upon
the altar.

**Leviticus 16:26 ff.** The man who took the goat into the desert, and
those who burned the two sin-offerings outside the camp (see at
Leviticus 4:11, 21), had also to wash their clothes and bathe their
bodies before they returned to the camp, because they had been defiled
by the animals laden with sin.

**Leviticus 16:29–34.** *“General directions for the yearly celebration
of the day of atonement.*—It was to be kept on the tenth day of the
seventh month, as an “everlasting statute” (see at Ex. 12:14). On that
day the Israelites were to “afflict their souls,” i.e., to fast,
according to Leviticus 23:32, from the evening of the 9th till the
evening of the 10th day. Every kind of work was to be suspended as on
the Sabbath (Ex. 20:10), by both natives and foreigners (see Ex. 12:49),
because this day was a high Sabbath (Ex. 31:15). Both fasting and
sabbatical rest are enjoined again in Leviticus 23:27ff. and Num. 29:7,
on pain of death. The fasting commanded for this day, the only fasting
prescribed in the law, is most intimately connected with the
signification of the feast of atonement. If the general atonement made
on this day was not to pass into a dead formal service, the people must
necessarily enter in spirit into the signification of the act of
expiation, prepare their souls for it with penitential feelings, and
manifest this penitential state by abstinence from the ordinary
enjoyments of life. To *“afflict* (bow, humble) *the soul,”* by
restraining the earthly appetites, which have their seat in the soul, is
the early Mosaic expression for *fasting* (צוּם). The latter word came
first of all into use in the time of the Judges (Judg. 20:26; 1 Sam.
7:6; cf. Ps. 35:13: “I afflicted my soul with fasting”). “By bowing his
soul the Israelite was to place himself in an inward relation to the
sacrifice, whose soul was given for his soul; and by this state of mind,
answering to the outward proceedings of the day, he was to appropriate
the fruit of it to himself, namely, the reconciliation of his soul,
which passed through the animal’s death” (*Baumgarten*).

**Leviticus 16:32 ff.** In the future, the priest who was anointed and
set apart for the duty of the priesthood in his father’s stead, i.e.,
the existing high priest, was to perform the act of expiation in the
manner prescribed, and that “once a year.” The yearly repetition of the
general atonement showed that the sacrifices of the law were not
sufficient to make the servant of God perfect according to this own
conscience. And this imperfection of the expiation, made with the blood
of bullocks and goats, could not fail to awaken a longing for the
perfect sacrifice of the eternal High Priest, who has obtained eternal
redemption by entering once, through His own blood, into the holiest of
all (Heb. 9:7–12). And just as this was effected negatively, so by the
fact that the high priest entered on this day into the holiest of all,
as the representative of the whole congregation, and there, before the
throne of God, completed its reconciliation with Him, was the necessity
exhibited in a positive manner for the true reconciliation of man, and
his introduction into a perfect and abiding fellowship with Him, and the
eventual realization of this by the blood of the Son of God, our eternal
High Priest and Mediator, prophetically foreshadowed. The closing words
in v. 34, “and he (i.e., Aaron, to whom Moses was to communicate the
instructions of God concerning the feast of atonement, v. 2) did as the
Lord commanded Moses,” are anticipatory in their character, like Ex.
12:50. For the law in question could not be carried out till the seventh
