Philippi
========

From [Philippi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippi), an article in
Wikipedia.

Philippi was a city in eastern Macedonia, established by the king of
Macedonia, Philip II (the father of Alexander the Great) in 356 BC and
abandoned in the 14th century after the Ottoman conquest. The present
municipality Filippoi is located near the ruins of the ancient city and
it is part of the periphery of East Macedonia in Greece.

The objective of founding the town was to take control of the
neighboring gold mines and to establish a garrison at a strategic
passage: the site controlled the route between Amphipolis and Neapolis,
part of the great royal route which crosses Macedonia from the east to
the west and which was reconstructed later by the Roman Empire as the
Via Egnatia. Philip II endowed the new city with important
fortifications, which partially blocked the passage between the swamp
and Mt. Orbelos, and sent colonists to occupy it. Philip also had the
marsh partially drained, as is attested by the writer Theophrastus.
Philippi preserved its autonomy within the kingdom of Macedon and had
its own political institutions (the Assembly of the demos). The
discovery of new gold mines near the city, at Asyla, contributed to the
wealth of the kingdom and Philip established a mint there. The city was
finally fully integrated into the kingdom under Philip V.

Philippi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Philippi)

**From W. J. Conybeare and J. S. Howson,** ***The Life and Epistles of
St. Paul.***

The plain between Haemus and Pangaeus is the plain of Philippi, where
the last battle was lost by the republicans of Rome. The whole region
around is eloquent of the history of this battle. Among the mountains on
the right was the difficult path by which the republican army penetrated
into Macedonia; on some part of the very ridge on which we stand were
the camps of Brutus and Cassius; s the stream before us is the river
which passed in front of them;" below us, ° upon the left hand of the
even field,““ is the marsh by which Antony crossed as he approached his
antagonist; directly opposite is the hill of Philippi, where Cassius
died; behind us is the narrow strait of the sea, across which Brutus
sent his body to the island of Thasos, lest the army should be
disheartened before the final struggle. The city of Philippi was itself
a monument of the termination of that struggle. It had been founded by
the father of Alexander, in a place called, from its numerous streams,
"The Place of Fountains," to commemorate the addition of a new province
to his kingdom, and to protect the frontier against the Thracian
mountaineers. For similar reasons the city of Philip was gifted by
Augustus with the privileges of a colonia.
[^1] It thus became at once a border garrison
of the province of Macedonia, and a perpetual memorial of his victory
over Brutus. And now a Jewish Apostle came to the same place, to win a
greater victory than that of Philippi, and to found a more durable
empire than that of Augustus. It is a fact of deep significance, that
the "first city" at which St. Paul arrived, on his entrance into
Europe, should be that "colony," which was more fit than any other in
the empire to be considered the representative of Imperial Rome.

The characteristic of a colonia was, that it was a miniature resemblance
of Rome. Philippi is not the first city of this kind to which we have
traced the footsteps of St. Paul; Antioch in Pisidia, and Alexandria
Troas, both possessed the same character but this is the first place
where Scripture calls our attention to the distinction; and the events
which befell the Apostle at Philippi were directly connected with the
privileges of the place as a Roman colony, and with his own privileges
as a Roman citizen. It will be convenient to consider these two subjects
together. A glance at some of the differences which subsisted among
individuals and communities in the provincial system will enable us to
see very clearly the position of the citizen and of the colony.

We have had occasion to speak of the combination of actual provinces and
nominally independent states through which the power of the Roman
Emperor was variously diffused; and again (Chapter 5), we have described
the division of the provinces by Augustus into those of the Senate, and
those of the Emperor. Descending now to examine the component population
of any one province, and to inquire into the political condition of
individuals and communities, we find here again a complicated system of
rules and exceptions.

As regards individuals, the broad distinction we must notice is that
between those who were citizens and those who were not citizens. When
the Greeks spoke of the inhabitants of the world, they divided them into
"Greeks" and "Barbarians," according as the language in which poets
and philosophers had written was native to them or foreign. Among the
Romans the phrase was different. The classes into which they divided
mankind consisted of those who were politically" Romans," and those who
had no link (except that of subjection) with the city of Rome. The
technical words were Cives and Peregrini "citizens" and " strangers."
The inhabitants of Italy were" citizens;" the inhabitants of all other
parts of the Empire (until Caracalla extended to the provinces the same
privileges which Julius Caesar had granted to the peninsula’) were
naturally and essentially "strangers." Italy was the Holy Land of the
kingdom of this world.

We may carry the parallel further in order to illustrate the difference
which existed among the citizens themselves. Those true born Italians,
who were diffused in vast numbers through the provinces, might be called
Citizens of the Dispersion; while those strangers who, at various times,
and for various reasons, had received the gift of citizenship, were in
the condition of political Proselytes. Such were Paul and Silas,," in
their relation to the empire, among their fellow Romans in the colony of
Philippi. Both these classes of citizens, however, were in full
possession of the same privileges; the most important of which were
exemption from scourging, and freedom from arrest, except in extreme
cases; and in all cases the right of appeal from the magistrate to the
Emperor. [^2]

The remarks which have been made concerning individuals may be extended,
in some degree, to communities in the provinces. The City of Rome might
be transplanted, as it were, into various parts of the empire, and
reproduced as a colonies; or an alien city might be adopted, under the
title of a municipium," into a close political communion with Rome.
Leaving out of view all cities of the latter kind (and indeed they were
limited entirely to the western provinces), we will confine ourselves
to what was called a colonia. A Roman colony was very different from
anything which we usually intend by the term. It was no mere mercantile
factory, such as those which the Phoenicians established in Spain, or on
those very shores of Macedonia with which we are now engaged : or such
as modern nations have founded in the Hudson's Bay territory or on the
coast of India.

Still less was it like those incoherent aggregates of human beings which
we have thrown, without care or system, on distant islands and
continents. It did not even go forth, as a, young Greek republic left
its parent state, carrying with it, indeed, the respect of a daughter
for a mother, but entering upon a new and independent existence.

The Roman colonies were primarily intended as military safeguards of the
frontiers, and as checks upon insurgent provincials. Like the military
roads, they were part of the great system of fortification by which the
Empire was made safe. They served also as convenient possessions for
rewarding veterans who had served in the wars, and for establishing
freedmen and other Italians whom it was desirable to remove to a
distance.

The colonists went out with all the pride of Roman citizens, to
represent and reproduce the City in the midst of an alien population.
They proceeded to their destination like an army with its standards;
and the limits of the new city were marked out by the plough. Their
names were still enrolled in one of the Roman tribes. Every traveler who
passed through a colonia saw there the insignia of Rome. He heard the
Latin language, and was amenable, in the strictest sense, to the Roman
law. The coinage of the city, even if it were in a Greek province, had
Latin inscriptions.

Cyprian tells us that in his own episcopal city, which once had been
Rome’s greatest enemy, the Laws of the XII. Tables were inscribed on
brazen tablets in the market place.," Though the colonists, in addition
to the poll tax, which they paid as citizens, were compelled to pay a
ground tax (for the land on which their city stood was provincial land,
and therefore tributary, unless it were assimilated to Italy by a
special exemption); s yet they were entirely free from any intrusion by
the governor of the province. Their affairs were regulated by their own
magistrates. These officers were named Duumviri ; and they took a pride
in calling themselves by the Roman title of Praetors."

The primary settlers in the colony were, as we have seen, real Italians;
but a state of things seems to have taken place, in many instances, very
similar to what happened in the early history of Rome itself. A number
of the native provincials grew up in the same city with the governing
body; and thus two (or sometimes three) co ordinate communities were
formed, which ultimately coalesced into one, like the Patricians and
Plebeians. Instances of this state of things might be given from Corinth
and Carthage, and from the colonies of Spain and Gaul; and we have no
reason to suppose that Philippi was different from the rest.

Whatever the relative proportion of Greeks and Romans at Philippi may
have been, the number of Jews was small. This is sufficiently accounted
for, when we remember that it was a military, and not a mercantile,
city. There was no synagogue in Philippi,. but only one of those
buildings called Proseuchae, which were distinguished from the regular
places of Jewish worship by being of a more alight and temporary
structure, and frequently open to the sky." [^3] For the sake of greater
quietness, and freedom from interruption, this place of prayer was “
outside the gate;" and, in consequence of the ablutions, which were
connected with the worship, it was" by the river side," on the bank of
the Gaggitas, the fountains of which gave the name to the city before
the time of Philip of Macedon, and which, in the great battle of the
Romans, had been polluted by the footsteps and blood of the contending
armies.

[^1]: The full and proper name was *Colonia Augusta Julia Philippensis.*

[^2]: Two of these privileges will come more particularly before us,
when we reach the narrative of St. Paul’s arrest at Jerusalem. It
appears that Paul and Silas were treated with a cruelty which was only
justifiable in the case of a slave, and was not usually allowed in the
case of any freeman. ‘It would seem, that an accused citizen could only
be imprisoned before trial for a very heinous offence,’ or when
evidently guilty. Bail was generally allowed, or retention in a
magistrate’s house was held sufficient.

[^3]: Extracts to this effect might be quoted from Epiphanies. A
Proseucha may be considered as a place of prayer, as opposed to a
synagogue, or a house of prayer. It appears, however, that the words
were more or less convertible, and some consider them nearly equivalent.
Josephus (Life, 54) describes a Proseucha as •a urge building, capable
of holding a considerable crowd:’ and Philo mentions, under the same
denomination, buildings at Alexandria, which were so strong that it was
difficult to destroy them. Probably, it was the usual name of the
meeting place of Jewish congregations in Greek cities. Other passages in
ancient writers, which bear upon the subject, are alluded to in the
following extract from Biscoe: "The seashore was esteemed by the Jews a
place most pure, and therefore proper to offer up their prayers and
thanksgiving to Almighty God. Philo tells us that the Jews of
Alexandria, when Flaccus the governor of Egypt, who had been their great
enemy, was arrested by order of the Emperor Gaius, not being able to
assemble at their synagogues, which had been taken from them, crowded
out at the gates of the city early in the morning, went to the
neighboring shores, and standing in a most pure place with one accord
lifted up their voices in praising God. Tertullian says, that the Jews
in his time, when they kept their great fast, left their synagogues, and
on every shore sent forth their prayers to heaven : and in another
place, among the ceremonies used by the Jews, mentions *orationes
littoral*, the prayers they made upon the shores. And long before
Tertullian’s time there was a decree made at Halicarnassus in favor of
the Jews, which, among other privileges, allows them to say their
prayers near the shore, according to the custom of their country.
(Joseph. Ant. xiv. 16, 23 It is hence abundantly evident, that it was
common with the Jews to choose the shore as a place highly fitting to
offer up their prayers..‑P.251. He adds that the words in Acts 16:13
‘may signify nothing more than that the Jews of Philippi were wont to go
and offer up their prayers at a certain place by the river side, as
other Jews who lived near the sea were accustomed to do upon the
sea‑shore.’ See Acts 21:5.
