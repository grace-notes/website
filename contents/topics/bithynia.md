Bithynia was a Roman province located in the northwest corner of Asia
Minor. The apostle Paul and Silas wanted to preach the gospel in
Bithynia on Paul’s second missionary journey but were prevented by the
Holy Spirit from doing so (Acts 16:7). The apostle Peter may have
ministered in Bithynia and other provinces of Asia Minor, since he
addressed his first letter to believers there (1 Pt 1:1). Christianity
entered Bithynia somehow, possibly through Peter.

Bithynia was occupied by a Thracian tribe that established a prosperous
kingdom there in the third century bc. In 75 bc, when Bithynia’s last
king, Nicomedes III, willed his kingdom to the Roman people, it became
part of the Roman Empire. For administrative purposes, it was generally
linked with the province of Pontus to the east.

After NT times, Bithynia figured significantly in church history. Early
in the second century, its Roman governor, Pliny the Younger, elicited
from the emperor Trajan the earliest stated imperial policy on
persecution of Christians. Later, the church councils of Nicaea (ad 325)
and Chalcedon (451) were held in two of Bithynia’s western cities. The
Council of Nicaea declared the full deity of Christ; the Council of
Chalcedon made pronouncements on the nature of the person of Christ and
the canonicity of the 27 NT books.

The Roman province of Bithynia was bordered on the north by the Black
Sea, on the west by the Propontis (modern Sea of Marmara), on the south
by the province of Asia, and on the east by Galatia and Pontus. Bithynia
was mountainous, with Mt Olympus in the south rising to 7,600 feet
(2,315.5 meters), but had districts of great fertility near the seacoast
and in its interior valleys. Besides producing fruit and grain, the
province had fine marble quarries, good timber, and excellent pasturage.
The principal river was the Sangarius (modern Sakarya), which flowed
from south to north into the Black Sea. Transportation was largely along
the river valleys.[^1]
