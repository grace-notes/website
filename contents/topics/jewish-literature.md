**Brief Outline of Ancient Jewish Theological Literature**

from Sketches of Jewish Social Life by Alfred Edersheim, 1876

The arrangements of the synagogue, as hitherto described, combined in a
remarkable manner fixedness of order with liberty of the individual.
Alike the seasons and the time of public services, their order, the
prayers to be offered, and the portions of the law to be read were
fixed. On the other hand, between the eighteen “benedictions” said on
ordinary days, and the seven repeated on the Sabbaths, free prayer might
be inserted; the selection from the prophets, with which the public
reading concluded–the “Haphtarah” (from “patar,” to “conclude”)–seems to
have been originally left to individual choice; while the determination
who was to read, or to conduct the prayers, or to address the people,
was in the hands of the “rulers of the synagogue” (Acts 13:15). The
latter, who were probably also the members of the local Sanhedrin, had
naturally charge of the conduct of public worship, as well as of the
government and discipline of the synagogues. They were men learned in
the law and of good repute, whom the popular voice designated, but who
were regularly set apart by “the laying on of hands,” or the “Semichah,”
which was done by at least three, who had themselves received
ordination, upon which the candidate had the formal title of Rabbi
bestowed on him, and was declared qualified to administer the law (Sanh.
13 b). The Divine Majesty was supposed to be in the midst of each
Sanhedrin, on account of which even that consisting of only three
members might be designated as “Elohim.” Perhaps this may have been said
in explanation and application of Psalm 82:6: “I have said, Ye are
Elohim; and all of you children of the Most High.”

The special qualifications for the office of Sanhedrist, mentioned in
Rabbinical writings, are such as to remind us of the directions of St.
Paul to Timothy (1 Tim 3:1-10). A member of the Sanhedrin must be wise,
modest, God-fearing, truthful, not greedy of filthy lucre, given to
hospitality, kindly, not a gambler, nor a usurer, nor one who traded in
the produce of Sabbatical years, nor yet one who indulged in unlawful
games (Sanh. iii. 3). They were called “Sekenim,” “elders” (Luke 7:3),
“Memunim,” “rulers” (Mark 5:22), “Parnasin,” “feeders, overseers,
shepherds of the flock” (Acts 20:28; 1 Peter 5:2), and “Manhigei,”
“guides” (Heb 13:7). They were under the presidency and supreme rule of
an “Archisynagogos,” or “Rosh-ha-Cheneseth,” “head of the synagogue”
(Yom. vii. 1; Sot. vii. 7), who sometimes seems to have even exercised
sole authority. The designation occurs frequently in the New Testament
(Matt 9:18; Mark 5:35,36,38; Luke 8:41,49, 13:14; Acts 18:8,17). The
inferior functions in the synagogue devolved on the “chassan,” or
“minister” (Luke 4:20). In course of time, however, the “chassanim”
combined with their original duties the office of schoolmaster; and at
present they lead both the singing and the devotions of the synagogue.
This duty originally devolved not on any fixed person, but whoever was
chosen might for the time being act as “Sheliach Zibbur,” or “legate of
the congregation.” Most modern writers have imagined, that the
expression “angel of the Church,” in the epistles to the seven churches
in the book of Revelation, was used in allusion to this ancient
arrangement of the synagogue. But the fact that the “Sheliach Zibbur”
represented not an office but a function, renders this view untenable.
Besides, in that case, the corresponding Greek expression would rather
have been “apostle” than “angel of the Church.” Possibly, however, the
writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews may refer to it, when he designates
the Lord Jesus “the Apostle and High-Priest of our profession” (Heb
3:1). Besides these functionaries, we also read of “Gabaei Zedakah,” or
collectors of charity, to whom the Talmud (B. Bathra, 8 b) by a jeu de
mots \* applies the promise that they “shall be as the stars for ever
and ever” (Dan 12:3), since they lead many to “righteousness.”

\* Zedakah means righteousness, but is also used for “charity.”

Alms were collected at regular times every week, either in money or in
victuals. At least two were employed in collecting, and three in
distributing charity, so as to avoid the suspicion of dishonesty or
partiality. These collectors of charity, who required to be “men of good
repute, and faithful,” are thought by many to have been the model for
the institution of the Diaconate in the early Church. But the analogy
scarcely holds good; nor, indeed, were such collectors employed in every
synagogue.

In describing the conduct of public worship in the synagogues, reference
was made to the “meturgeman,” who translated into the vernacular dialect
what was read out of the Hebrew Scriptures, and also to the “darshan,”
who expounded the Scriptures or else the traditional law in an address,
delivered after the reading of the “Haphtarah,” or section from the
prophets. These two terms will have suggested names which often occur in
writings on Jewish subjects, and may fitly lead to some remarks on
Jewish theology at the time of our Lord. Now the work of the
“meturgeman” \* was perpetuated in the Targum, and that of the “darshan”
in the Midrash.

\* Hence also the term “dragoman.”

Primarily the Targum, then, was intended as a translation of the Hebrew
Scriptures into the vernacular Aramaean. Of course, such translations
might be either literal, or else more or less paraphrastic. Every Targum
would also naturally represent the special views of the translator, and
be interesting as affording an insight into the ideas prevalent at the
time, and the manner in which Scripture was understood. But some
Targumim are much more paraphrastic than others, and indeed become a
kind of commentary, showing us the popular theology of the time.
Strictly speaking, we have really no Targum dating from the time of our
Lord, nor even from the first century of our era. There can be no doubt,
however, that such a Targum did exist, although it has been lost. Still,
the Targumim preserved to us, although collated, and having received
their present form at later periods, contain very much that dates from
the Temple-period, and even before that. Mentioning them in the order of
their comparative antiquity, we have the Targum of Onkelos, on the five
books of Moses; the Targum of Jonathan, on the prophets (inclusive of
Joshua, Judges, and the books of Samuel and of the Kings); the so-called
(or pseudo) Jonathan on the Pentateuch; and the Jerusalem Targum, which
is but a fragment. Probably the latter two were intended to be
supplemental to the Targum Onkelos. Late criticism has thrown doubt even
on the existence of such a person as Onkelos. Whoever may have been the
author, this Targum, in its present form, dates probably from the third,
that of Jonathan on the prophets from the fourth century.

In some respects more interesting than the Targumim are the Midrashim,
of which we possess three, dating probably, in their present form, from
the first or second century of our era, but embodying many parts much
older. These are–mentioning them again in the order of their
antiquity–“Siphra” (the book), a commentary on Leviticus; “Siphri,” a
commentary on Numbers and Deuteronomy; and “Mechiltha,” a commentary on
certain portions of Exodus. But we have even a monument more interesting
than these, of the views of the ancient Pharisees, and of their
Scriptural interpretations. Some of the fathers referred to a work
called “Lesser Genesis,” or the “Book of Jubilees.” This had been lost
to theological literature, till again discovered within the present
century, although not in the original Hebrew, nor even in its first or
Greek translation, but in an Ethiopic rendering from the latter. The
work, which no doubt dates from the era of our Lord, covers the same
ground as the first book of Moses, whence the name of “Lesser Genesis.”
It gives the Biblical narrative from the creation of the world to the
institution of the Passover, in the spirit in which the Judaism of that
period would view it. The legendary additions, the Rabbinical ideas
expressed, the interpretations furnished, are just such as one would
expect to find in such a work. One of the main objects of the writer
seems to have been the chronology of the book of Genesis, which it is
attempted to settle. All events are recorded according to
Jubilee-periods of forty-nine years, whence the name “Book of Jubilees,”
given to the work. These “Jubilees” are again arranged into “weeks,”
each of seven years (a day for a year); and events are classified as
having taken place in a certain month of a certain year, of a certain
“week” of years, of a certain “Jubilee”-period. Another tendency of the
book, which, however, it has in common with all similar productions, is
to trace up all later institutions to the patriarchal period. \*

\* Although the “Book of Jubilees” seems most likely of Pharisaic
authorship, the views expressed in it are not always those of the
Pharisees. Thus the resurrection is denied, although the immortality of
the soul is maintained.

Besides these works, another class of theological literature has been
preserved to us, around which of late much and most serious controversy
has gathered. Most readers, of course, know about the Apocrypha; but
these works are called the “pseudo-epigraphic writings.” Their
subject-matter may be described as mainly dealing with unfulfilled
prophecy; and they are couched in language and figures borrowed, among
others, from the book of Daniel. In fact, they read like attempts at
imitating certain portions of that prophecy–only that their scope is
sometimes wider. This class of literature is larger than those not
acquainted with the period might have expected. Yet when remembering the
troubles of the time, the feverish expectations of a coming deliverance,
and the peculiar cast of mind and training of those who wrote them, they
scarcely seem more numerous, nor perhaps even more extravagant, than a
certain kind of prophetic literature, abundant among us not long ago,
which the fear of Napoleon or other political events from time to time
called forth. To that kind of production, they seem, at least to us, to
bear an essential likeness–only that, unlike the Western, the Oriental
expounder of unfulfilled prophecy assumes rather the language of the
prophet than that of the commentator, and clothes his views in mystic
emblematic language. In general, this kind of literature may be arranged
into Greek and Hebrew–according as the writers were either Egyptian
(Hellenistic) or Palestinian Jews. Considerable difficulty exists as to
the precise date of some of these writings–whether previous or
subsequent to the time of Christ. These difficulties are, of course,
increased when it is sought to fix the precise period when each of them
was composed. Still, late historical investigations have led to much
accord on general points. Without referring to the use which opponents
of Christianity have of late attempted to make of these books, it may be
safely asserted that their proper study and interpretation will yet be
made very helpful, not only in casting light upon the period, but in
showing the essential difference between the teaching of the men of that
age and that of the New Testament. For each branch and department of
sacred study, the more carefully, diligently, and impartially it is
pursued, affords only fresh testimony to that truth which is most
certainly, and on the best and surest grounds, believed among us.

It were, however, a mistake to suppose that the Rabbinical views,
extravagant as they so often are, were propounded quite independently of
Scripture. On the contrary, every traditional ordinance, every
Rabbinical institution, nay, every legend and saying, is somehow foisted
upon the text of the Old Testament. To explain this, even in the
briefest manner, it is necessary to state that, in general, Jewish
traditionalism is distinguished into the “Halakhah” and the “Haggadah.”
The “Halakhah” (from “halach,” to “walk”) indicates the settled legal
determinations, which constituted the “oral law,” or “Thorah shebeal
peh.” Nothing could here be altered, nor was any freedom left to the
individual teacher, save that of explanation and illustration. The
object of the “Halakhah” was to state in detail, and to apply to all
possible cases, the principles laid down in the law of Moses; as also to
surround it, as it were, with “a hedge,” in order to render every
unwitting transgression impossible. The “Halakhah” enjoyed not only the
same authority with the law of Moses, but, as being explanatory, in some
respects was even more highly esteemed. Indeed, strictly speaking, it
was regarded as equally with the Pentateuch the revelation of God to
Moses; only the form or manner of revelation was regarded as
different–the one being committed to writing, the other handed down by
word of mouth. According to tradition, Moses explained the traditional
law successively to Aaron, to his sons, to the seventy elders, and to
the people–care being taken that each class heard it four times
(Maimonides’ Preface to Seraim, 1 a). The Talmud itself attempts to
prove that the whole traditional law, as well as the writings of the
prophets and the Hagiographa, had been communicated to Moses, by quoting
Exodus 24:12: “I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and
commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.” “The
‘tables of stone,’” argues Rabbi Levi (Ber. 5 1), “are the ten
commandments; the ‘law’ is the written law (in the Pentateuch); the
‘commandments’ are the Mishnah; ‘which I have written,’ refers to the
prophets and the Hagiographa; while the words, ‘that thou mayest teach
them,’ point to the Gemara. From this we learn, that all this was given
to Moses on Sinai.”

If such was the “Halakhah,” it is not so easy to define the limits of
the “Haggadah.” The term, which is derived from the verb “higgid,” to
“discuss,” or “tell about,” covers all that possessed not the authority
of strict legal determinations. It was legend, or story, or moral, or
exposition, or discussion, or application–in short, whatever the fancy
or predilections of a teacher might choose to make it, so that he could
somehow connect it either with Scripture or with a “Halakhah.” For this
purpose some definite rules were necessary to preserve, if not from
extravagance, at least from utter absurdity. Originally there were four
such canons for connecting the “Haggadah” with Scripture. Contracting,
after the favorite manner of the Jews, the initial letters, these four
canons were designated by the word “Pardes” (Paradise). They were–1. To
ascertain the plain meaning of a passage (the “Peshat”); 2. To take the
single letters of a word as an indication or hint (“Remes”) of other
words, or even of whole sentences; 3. The “Derush,” or practical
exposition of a passage; and 4. To find out the “Sod” (mystery), or
mystical meaning of a verse or word. These four canons were gradually
enlarged into thirty-two rules, which gave free vent to every kind of
fancifulness. Thus one of these rules–the “Gematria” (geometry,
calculation)–allowed the interpreter to find out the numerical value of
the letters in a word–the Hebrew letters, like the Roman, being also
numerals–and to substitute for a word one or more which had the same
numerical value. Thus, if in Numbers 12:1 we read that Moses was married
to an “Ethiopian woman” (in the original, “Cushith”), Onkelos
substitutes instead of this, by “gematria,” the words, “of fair
appearance”–the numerical value both of Cushith and of the words “of
fair appearance” being equally 736. By this substitution the
objectionable idea of Moses’ marrying an Ethiopian was at the same time
removed. Similarly, the Mishnah maintains that those who loved God were
to inherit each 310 worlds, the numerical value of the word “substance”
(“Yesh”) in Proverbs 8:21 being 310. On the other hand, the canons for
the deduction of a “Halakhah” from the text of Scripture were much more
strict and logical. Seven such rules are ascribed to Hillel, which were
afterwards enlarged to thirteen. \*

\* It would be beyond the scope of this volume to explain these
“middoth,” or “measurements,” and to illustrate them by examples. Those
who are interested in the matter are referred to the very full
discussion on Rabbinical exegesis in my History of the Jewish Nation,
pp. 570-580.

Little objection can be taken to them; but unfortunately their practical
application was generally almost as fanciful, and certainly as
erroneous, as in the case of the “Haggadah.”

Probably most readers would wish to know something more of those
“traditions” to which our Lord so often referred in His teaching. We
have here to distinguish, in the first place, between the Mishnah and
the Gemara. The former was, so to speak, the text, the latter its
extended commentary. At the same time, the Mishnah contains also a good
deal of commentary, and much that is not either legal determination or
the discussion thereof; while the Gemara, on the other hand, also
contains what we would call “text.” The word Mishna (from the verb
“shanah”) means “repetition”–the term referring to the supposed
repetition of the traditional law, which has been above described. The
Gemara, as the very word shows, means “discussion,” and embodies the
discussions, opinions, and saying of the Rabbis upon, or a propos of,
the Mishnah. Accordingly, the text of the Mishnah is always given in the
pages of the Talmud, which reproduce those discussions thereon of the
Jewish Theological parliament or academy, which constitute the Gemara.
The authorities introduced in the Mishnah and the Gemara range from
about the year 180 BC to 430 AD (in the Babylon Talmud). The Mishnah is,
of course, the oldest work, and dates, in its present form and as a
written compilation, from the close of the second century of our era.
Its contents are chiefly “Halakhah,” there being only one Tractate
(Aboth) in which there is no “Halakhah” at all, and another (on the
measurements of the Temple) in which it but very rarely occurs. Yet
these two Tractates are of the greatest historical value and interest.
On the other hand, there are thirteen whole Tractates in the Mishnah
which have no “Haggadah” at all, and other twenty-two in which it is but
of rare occurrence. Very much of the Mishnah must be looked upon as
dating before, and especially from the time of Christ, and its
importance for the elucidation of the New Testament is very great,
though it requires to be most judiciously used. The Gemara, or book of
discussions on the Mishnah, forms the two Talmuds–the Jerusalem and the
Babylon Talmud. The former is so called because it is the product of the
Palestinian academies; the latter is that of the Babylonian school. The
completion of the Jerusalem or Palestinian Talmud (“Talmud” = doctrine,
lore) dates from the middle of the fourth, that of the Babylonian from
the middle of the sixth century of our era. It need scarcely be said
that the former is of much greater historical value than the latter.
Neither of these two Gemaras, as we now possess them, is quite
complete–that is, there are Tractates in the Mishnah for which we have
no Gemara, either in the Jerusalem or in the Babylon Talmud. Lastly, the
Babylon Talmud is more than four times the size of that of Jerusalem.
Obviously this is not the place for giving even the briefest outline of
the contents of the Mishnah. \*

\* In Appendix 1 we give as a specimen a translation of one of the
Mishnic Tractates; and in Appendix 2 translations of extracts from the
Babylon Talmud.

Suffice it here to state that it consists of six books (“sedarim,”
“orders”), which are subdivided into Tractates (“Massichthoth”), and
these again into chapters (“Perakim”), and single determinations or
traditions (“Mishnaioth”). In quoting the Mishnah it is customary to
mention not the Book (or “Seder”) but the special Tractate, the Perek
(or chapter), and the Mishnah. The names of these Tractates (not those
of the books) give a sufficient idea of their contents, which cover
every conceivable, and well-nigh every inconceivable case, with full
discussions thereon. Altogether the Mishnah contains sixty-three
Tractates, consisting of 525 chapters, and 4,187 “Mishnaioth.”

There is yet another branch of Jewish theology, which in some respects
is the most interesting to the Christian student. There can be no doubt,
that so early as the time of our Lord a series of doctrines and
speculations prevailed which were kept secret from the multitude, and
even from ordinary students, probably from fear of leading them into
heresy. This class of study bears the general name of the “Kabbalah,”
and, as even the term (from “kabal,” to “receive,” or “hand down”)
implies, represents the spiritual traditions handed down from earliest
times, although mixed up, in course of time, with many foreign and
spurious elements. The “Kabbalah” grouped itself chiefly around the
history of the creation, and the mystery of God’s Presence and Kingdom
in the world, as symbolised in the vision of the chariot and of the
wheels (Eze 1). Much that is found in Cabalistic writings approximates
so closely to the higher truths of Christianity, that, despite the
errors, superstitions, and follies that mingle with it, we cannot fail
to recognize the continuance and the remains of those deeper facts of
Divine revelation, which must have formed the substance of prophetic
teaching under the Old Testament, and have been understood, or at least
hoped for, by those who were under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

If now, at the close of these sketches of Jewish life, we ask ourselves,
what might have been expected as to the relation between Christ and the
men and the religion of His period, the answer will not be difficult.
Assuredly, in one respect Christ could not have been a stranger to His
period, or else His teaching would have found no response, and, indeed,
have been wholly unintelligible to His contemporaries. Nor did He
address them as strangers to the covenant, like the heathen. His was in
every respect the continuation, the development, and the fulfillment of
the Old Testament. Only, He removed the superincumbent load of
traditionalism; He discarded the externalism, the formalism, and the
work-righteousness, which had well-nigh obliterated the spiritual truths
of the Old Testament, and substituted in their place the worship of the
letter. The grand spiritual facts, which it embodied, He brought forward
in all their brightness and meaning; the typical teaching of that
dispensation He came to show forth and to fulfil; and its prophecies He
accomplished, alike for Israel and the world. And so in Him all that was
in the Old Testament–of truth, way, and life–became “Yea and Amen.” Thus
we can understand how, on the one hand, the Lord could avail Himself of
every spiritual element around, and adopt the sayings, parables, ideas,
and customs of that period–indeed, must have done so, in order to be a
true man of the period,–and yet be so wholly not of that time as to be
despised, rejected, and delivered up unto death by the blind guides of
His blinded fellow-countrymen. Had He entirely discarded the period in
which He lived, had He not availed Himself of all in it that was true or
might be useful, He would not have been of it–not the true man Christ
Jesus. Had He followed it, identified Himself with its views and hopes,
or headed its movements, He would not have been the Christ, the Son of
the living God, the promised Deliverer from sin and guilt.

And so we can also perceive the reason of the essential enmity to Christ
on the part of the Pharisees and Scribes. It was not that He was a new
and a strange Teacher; it was, that He came as the Christ. Theirs was
not an opposition of teaching to His; it was a contrariety of
fundamental life-principles. “Light came into the world, but men loved
darkness rather than light.” Closely related as the two were, the
Pharisaical Judaism of that and of the present period is at the opposite
pole from the religion of Christ–alike as regards the need of man, the
purposes of God’s love, and the privileges of His children. There was
one truth which, we are reluctantly obliged to admit, found, alas!
scarcely any parallel in the teaching of Rabbinism: it was that of a
suffering Messiah. Hints indeed there were, as certain passages in the
prophecies of Isaiah could not be wholly ignored or misrepresented, even
by Rabbinical ingenuity, just as the doctrine of vicarious suffering and
substitution could not be eliminated from the practical teaching of the
confession of sins over the sacrifices, when the worshipper day by day
laid his hands upon, and transferred to them his guilt. Yet Judaism,
except in the case of the few, saw not in all this that to which alone
it could point as its real meaning: “The Lamb of God, which taketh away
the sin of the world.”

And now, as century after century has passed, and the gladsome Gospel
message has been carried from nation to nation, while Israel is still
left in the darkness of its unbelief and the misery of its mistaken
hope, we seem to realize with ever increasing force that “The people
that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the
land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.” Yes:
“unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the government
shall be upon His shoulder: and His Name shall be called Wonderful,
Counselor, The mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace”
(Isa 9:2,6). For assuredly, “God hath not cast away His people which He
foreknew.” But “all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall
come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from
Jacob” (Rom 11:2,26). “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of
the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night”
(Isa 21:11,12).
