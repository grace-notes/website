**Benjamin** benʹ-jə-min [Heb *binyāmîn*—‘son of the right hand’].

The youngest of Jacob’s sons, the only one to be born in Palestine; and
the tribe named for him. According to tradition, his mother Rachel died
in giving him birth (Gen. 35:16–20), and the name Ben-oni, “son of my
sorrow” (Gen. 35:18), was given by the dying Rachel; Jacob, however,
named him Benjamin.

Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh formed a special group among the tribes,
all of them being sons of Rachel. Some scholars believe that as “sons of
Rachel” these tribes were goatherds at the time of their wanderings,
since the name Rachel in Hebrew means “young goat,” and that the other
tribes were cattle breeders inasmuch as they were related to Leah (“cow”
in Akkadian; “wild cow” in Arabic). The tribes descendant from Rachel
finally settled in Canaan in an uninterrupted stretch of country. As the
territory of Benjamin lay S of that of Manasseh and Ephraim, i.e., to
the right of them, some scholars have believed that their name was given
them after their settlement. The tradition of Benjamin having been born
in Palestine may mean, according to some scholars, that this tribe had
already settled there before the coming to Canaan of Jacob and his sons.

At the time of the Exodus the number of men of war in the tribe is given
as 35,400; at the time of the second census as 45,600 (Nu. 1:37; 26:41);
their place was with the standard of the camp of Ephraim, W of the
tabernacle; their leader was Abidan son of Gideoni (Nu. 2:22). Benjamin
was represented among the spies by Palti son of Raphu (Nu. 13:9). At the
time of the division of the land the leader of Benjamin was Elidad son
of Chislon (34:21).

The tribe of Benjamin settled between Ephraim to the north and Judah to
the south. To the west their neighbor was the tribe of Dan (Josh.
18:11).

The northern border started from the Jordan over against Jericho, then
continued to the west toward Bethaven, the northern part of the
Wilderness of Judah. From there it turned NW to Bethel, then to
Ataroth-addar and W to the neighborhood of Beth-horon. The western
border crossed the town of Kiriath-jearim and then turned east. The
southern border crossed the waters of Nephtoah and then ran S of
Jerusalem through Beth-hoglah and joined the river Jordan again near its
mouth (Jgs. 18:11–20).

The eastern parts of the territory of Benjamin were seized by force at
the beginning of the Israelite conquest of Canaan. But most of their
territory was acquired through the treaty between the Israelites and the
four Hivite cities (Josh. 9:7). This situation is reflected in the list
of Benjaminite cities (18:21–28), which is divided into two groups of a
dozen cities each. The first group, the conquered area, consists of the
cities of the southern Jordan Valley E of the watershed; the second
group of cities, which came to them through the treaty, lay W of the
watershed.

The first of the judges that emerged in Israel after the conquest was
Ehud of the tribe of Benjamin, who fought the Moabites. If we trace in
the genealogical lists the names that reflect place names, it appears
that during this period Benjamin expanded northward and southward, and
later also to the west when the tribe of Dan left its previous
territory. The Benjaminites were men of war and famous slingers (Gen.
49:27; Jgs. 3:15; 1 Ch. 8:40; 12:2). The story told in Jgs. 19–21
presents many difficulties that cannot be discussed here. The atrocity
committed by the Benjaminites and the terrible punishment they suffered
for it illustrate certain features of life in those lawless times when
there was no king in Israel. The refusal of the men of Jabesh-Gilead (of
the tribe of Manasseh) to take part in the battle of requital against
Benjamin provides the background for the special relationship between
the Benjaminites and the inhabitants of that city. It explains why Saul
and the Benjaminites came to their aid when Jabesh-Gilead was attacked
by the Ammonites (1 S. 11:1–3).

Benjamin was also the first tribe to oppose the Philistines. From among
the Benjaminites arose the first king, Saul. After his death David a
Judahite, became king. David did not easily win the loyalty of the
Benjaminites; and one of them, Shimei son of Gera, a descendant of Saul,
took part in Absalom’s rebellion (2 S. 16:5). Sheba son of Bichri led
the revolt against David after the quelling of Absalom’s rebellion (2 S.
21:1f). Owing to David’s peaceful policy, however, the Benjaminites
finally joined him and remained loyal to his son Solomon even after the
division of the kingdom. From that time the history of the tribe is the
history of the kingdom of Judah.

Other Benjaminites of distinction were the prophet Jeremiah (1:1),
Esther and Mordecai (Est. 2:5), and the Apostle Paul (Rom. 11:1; Phil.
3:5).
