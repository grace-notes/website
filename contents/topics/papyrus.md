<sup>Papyrus</sup>

From International Standard Bible Encyclopedia

**Papyrus**pə-pīʹrəs [Lat *cyperus papyrus*—‘the Egyptian papyrus’; Heb
*gōme˒*] (Job 8:11); AV RUSH; [Gk *býblos*, *bíblos*—‘papyrus plant or
roll made of papyrus’], whence “book” (Mk. 12:26). **A plant and the
writing material that was made from it.**

The papyrus was a marsh or water plant, abundant in Egypt in ancient
times, that served many purposes in antiquity. The papyrus tuft was the
emblem of the northern kingdom in Egypt and, like the lotus, was a
favorite design on the capitals of columns. Ropes, sandals, and mats
were made from its fibers (cf. Homer Od xxi.391; Herodotus ii.37, 69),
and bundles of the long stalks were bound together into light boats
(Isa. 18:2; cf. Job 9:26)

I. Papyrus Paper
================

From the papyrus plant early Egyptians made the tough and inexpensive
paper that became the common writing material of the ancient world. The
white cellular pitch of the long, triangular papyrus stalk was stripped
of its bark or rind and sliced into thin strips. Two layers of these
strips were laid at right angles to each other on a hard surface, forced
together by pounding, dried, and smoothed with pumice. The sheets thus
formed were pasted together to form a roll of any length desired. Pliny
the Elder described the process and the product (Nat.hist. xiii. 11–13).

II. Egyptian Papyri
===================

Extant Egyptian papyrus rolls date from the 27th cent b.c. and no doubt
papyrus had been manufactured for centuries before. The Egyptian rolls
were sometimes very long and were often beautifully decorated with
colored vignettes (*The Book of the Dead*). Egyptian documents of great
historical value have been preserved on these fragile rolls. The Ebers
Papyrus of the 16th cent b.c. sums up Egyptians medical lore from the
time of Amenhotep I. The Harris Papyrus, 41 m (133 ft) long in 117
columns, dates from the mid-12th cent b.c. and records the benefactions
and achievements of Ramses III. Papyri of the 19th, 20th, and 21st
Dynasties are relatively numerous, and their contribution is important
for Egyptian history, life, and religion. By 1000 b.c. papyrus was used
for writing far beyond the limits of Egypt. The Wen-Amon Papyrus (11th
cent b.c.) relates that five hundred rolls of papyrus were among the
goods sent from the Delta to the prince of Byblos, but except in rare
instances papyri have escaped destruction only in Upper Egypt, where the
dry climate favored their preservation.

III. Greek Papyri
=================

With Alexander’s conquest of Egypt (332 b.c.) and the subsequent
Ptolemaic dynasty, Greeks came more than ever before into Egypt, and
from Greek centers like Alexandria and Arsinoë in the Faiyûm the Greek
language began to spread. Greek papyri are abundant from the Ptolemaic
(323–30 b.c.), Roman (30 b.c.-a.d. 292/3), and Byzantine (a.d.
292/3–642) periods, i.e., from the death of Alexander to the Arab
conquest. The three hundred Aphrodito Greek and Coptic papyri, published
by Bell and Crum, date from a.d. 698–722 and show how Greek persisted in
the Arab period.

**A. Discovery**The first important discovery of Greek papyri in modern
times was made in 1752 among the ruins of Herculaneum, near Naples.
There in a house that had been destroyed and buried by volcanic ash from
Vesuvius (a.d. 79) was found a whole library of papyrus rolls, charred
by the heat. With the utmost pains many of these carbonized rolls were
unrolled and deciphered, and the first part of them was published in
1793. They consist almost wholly of works of Epicurean philosophy.

The first Greek papyri discovered in Egypt were forty or fifty papyrus
rolls that local residents claimed to have unearthed in a box of
sycamore wood in Giza. One roll, purchased by a dealer, was presented to
Cardinal Stefano Borgia in 1778; the others were destroyed as worthless.
N. I. Schow published the Borgia Papyrus ten years later; his edition
included the first documentary text on papyrus, a list of certain
peasants forced to work on the Nile embankment at Tebtunis in a.d. 192.

In 1820 natives found papyri, mainly from the 2nd cent b.c., in an
earthen pot at the site of the Serapeum in Memphis. The papyri fell into
various hands and are now in the museums of London, Paris, Leiden, and
Rome. With them papyri began to flow steadily into the British and
Continental museums. The present period of papyrus recovery dates from
1877, when an immense mass of Greek and other papyri, most documentary
rather than literary, was found at the mound (*kom*) el-Faris in the
Faiyûm, on the site of the ancient Arsinoë. The bulk of this collection
passed into the hands of Archduke Rainer at Vienna; the museums of
Paris, London, Oxford, and Berlin secured minor portions. These texts
belong mainly to the Byzantine period.

Most of these discoveries were made by natives digging for fertile earth
(*sebakh*) at ancient sites and occasionally finding antiquities to sell
to tourists or dealers. By this time, however, the Egypt Exploration
Fund (later Society) had begun its operations in Egypt, and Flinders
Petrie was at work there. Digging among Ptolemaic tombs at Gurob in
1889–1890, Petrie found many mummies, with mummy-casings made of
“cartonnage,” papyri pasted together. Scholars hailed the Petrie papyri
as the most important found to that time, for they were mainly from the
3rd cent b.c. and included a copy of Plato’s *Phaedo*. The British
Museum secured papyri of the lost work of Aristotle, *Constitution of
Athens*, the lost *Mimes* of Herodas, a fragment of an oration of
Hyperides, and extensive literary papyri of works already extant. The
Louvre acquired the larger part of the *Oration Against Athenogenes*,
the masterpiece of Hyperides. In 1894 B. P. Grenfell of Oxford began
working with Petrie in the Egyptian excavations and secured papyri, with
D. G. Hogarth, for England.

With A. S. Hunt of Oxford, Grenfell excavated in 1896–1897 at Behnesa,
the Roman Oxyrhynchus, and unearthed the greatest mass of Greek papyri
of the Roman period thus far found. Their discovery in 1900 of a great
mass of Ptolemaic papyri at Tebtunis in the Faiyûm was comparable in
importance to their Oxyrhynchus find. One of the most productive sources
of papyri at Tebtunis was the crocodile cemetery, where many mummies of
the sacred crocodiles were wrapped in papyrus cartonnage. Grenfell and
Hunt also excavated important Ptolemaic texts imbedded in mummy
cartonnage in 1902 at Hibeh, and P. Jouguet made similar finds in 1901
at Ghoran and in 1902 at Medinet en-Nahas. Excavations by Grenfell and
Hunt at Oxyrhynchus in 1903–1907 produced results almost as astonishing
and quite as valuable as those of the first excavations there. The work
of L. Borchardt and a German team at Abusir in 1902 has exceptional
interest, for it uncovered the then-earliest Greek papyrus text, a
fourth-century papyrus roll of the verses of Timotheus of Miletus. The
Timotheus roll held this precedence until 1962, when a fourth-century
papyrus roll containing an allegorical commentry on the Orphic hymns was
discovered in the funeral pyre of a tomb at Derveni near Thessalonica in
Greece. The acquisition of papyri by purchase and excavation continues
to the present, chiefly in Egypt but also occasionally elsewhere, e.g.,
at Dura-Europos on the Euphrates and at numerous sites in the Judean
desert.

**B. Literary**More than 1500 Greek literary papyri, great and small, of
works other than biblical and theological have been published. That
about one-half are Homeric attests the great popularity of the *Iliad*
and *Odyssey* in Greco-Roman times. These are now so abundant and
extensive that they make an important contribution to Homeric textual
studies. Rather less than one-third preserve works of other ancient
writers that were already known through medieval or modern copies. Among
these are works of Plato, Demosthenes, Isocrates, Thucydides, Euripides,
Sophocles, Aeschines, and Herodotus. Another extensive group preserves
works or fragments of works that were usually regarded as lost or were
unknown. They include portions of Alcman, Sappho, and the lost *Antiope*
and *Hypsipyle* of Euripides, fragments of the comedies of Menander and
the Iambi of Callimachus, *Mimes* of Herodas, poems of Bacchylides,
Aristotle’s *Constitution of Athens*, the *Persae* of Timotheus, and six
orations, one of them complete, of Hyperides.

**C. Documentary**The overwhelming majority of published Greek papyri —
more than 15,000 — have been documentary. This category embraces every
kind of public and private text, including letters, accounts, wills,
receipts, contracts, leases, deeds, complaints, petitions, notices, and
invitations. The value of these contemporary and original documents for
the illumination of ancient life can hardly be overestimated. The life
of Upper Egypt in Ptolemaic and Roman times is now probably better known
than that of any other period of history down to recent times. Among the
most important of the Ptolemaic documentary papyri are the revenue laws
of Ptolemy Philadelphus (259 b.c.) and the forty-seven decrees of
Ptolemy Euergetes II (118 b.c., 140–139 b.c.). In 1910 a papyrus now in
Hamburg supplied the *Constitutio Antoniniana*, by which Roman
citizenship was conferred upon the *peregrini* (non-Italians) of the
empire. The private documents are even more important illustrations of
the life of common people in antiquity.

**D. Septuagint**More than 150 papyri of the LXX have been discovered.
Perhaps the most important is the Berlin Genesis (3rd or 4th cent a.d.)
in a cursive hand, purchased at Akhmîm in 1906. Other papyri preserving
parts of Genesis among the Amherst, British Museum, and Oxyrhynchus
papyri date from the 3rd or 4th century. British Museum 230 (3rd cent)
preserves Ps. 12:7–15:4. A Berlin papyrus contains Ps. 40:26–41:4. An
Amherst papyrus (7th cent) shows parts of Pss. 108, 118, 135, 138–140.
Of the Prophets the chief papyrus is the Heidelberg Codex (7th cent),
which contains Zec. 4:6 to Mal. 4:5. The John Rylands Library of
Manchester has papyrus fragments of Dt. 23–28 from mummy cartonnage
dating from the 2nd cent b.c.; with a Fuad papyrus of Dt. 31:36–32:7
they comprise the earliest witnesses to the LXX. The important Chester
Beatty collection in Dublin contains portions of several LXX codices,
including two of Genesis (3rd cent and 4th cent), Numbers and
Deuteronomy (2nd cent), Isaiah (3rd cent), and Ezekiel and Esther (3rd
cent). Papyrus fragments of the LXX discovered in caves near Khirbet
Qumrân date from the 1st cent b.c. (*see* Dead Sea Scrolls). The great
antiquity of some of these documents gives special interest to their
readings.

**E. New Testament** Eighty-three papyri containing parts of the Greek
NT have been discovered in Egypt. They vary in age from the 2nd to the
7th cents and in extent from scraps of a few verses to almost complete
codices of a Gospel, Acts, or the Pauline letters. The fragment of Jn.
18:31–34, 37f in the John Rylands Library, dated ca 125, is the oldest
witness to the NT text. Another remarkable MS is Bodmer Papyrus XIV and
XV, a third-century codex containing most of Luke and John. It preserves
an early and important text-type found in the famed Codex Vaticanus. The
Bodmer collection of Geneva includes another important papyrus codex of
John from ca 200. The last leaves of this codex belong to the Chester
Beatty collection, which also has a valuable codex of the Gospels and
Acts from the 3rd cent and a codex from ca 200 originally containing
Romans, Hebrews, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians,
Colossians, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians, in that order.

Eighty of the known NT papyri are parts of codices. The three remaining
papyri are parts of rolls that originally carried classical and OT texts
and were inscribed later on their backs (verso) with NT passages.

*F. Theological*Of the numerous Greek theological papyri that have come
to light, thirty-one fragments of NT apocryphal writings have been
published. The Oxyrhynchus sayings of Jesus, dating from 2nd and 3rd
cents, are probably the best known (*see* Logia). Other Oxyrhynchus
papyri preserve parts of the Apocalypse of Baruch (chs 12–14; 4th or 5th
cent); the Acts of John (4th cent); and Irenaeus *Adv Haer* iii.9 (3rd
cent). The Shepherd of Hermas is now attested by numerous papyrus
fragments from the 2nd to 6th centuries. Among the valuable theological
papyri discovered in 1941 at Tura were the lost commentaries on the
Psalms, Job, and Zechariah by Didymus the Blind (6th or 7th cent) and
several works of Origen, including commentaries on Exodus and Romans, a
homily on 1 Kings, *Contra Celsum*, and the lost *Dialogue with
Heracleides*, all from the 6th and 7th centuries. Several Greek papyri
from the 3rd to 5th cents contain the *Homily on the Passion* by Melito
of Sardis. The papyri continue to furnish important texts of patristic
literature as well as early Christian homilies, hymns, prayers, letters,
and amulets.

IV. Aramaic and Hebrew Papyri
=============================

From 1893 to 1908 numerous Aramaic papyri, dating from the 5th cent
b.c., were found on Elephantine (Egyp *Yeb*), an island near Aswân (Egyp
*Sewen*; cf. Syene [Heb *s*<sup>*e*</sup>*wēnēh*] of Ezk. 29:10,
denoting the southern border of Egypt). The literary papyri contain
portions of the Book of Ahiqar and an Aramaic version of Darius’s
Behistun inscription. The documentary texts reflect the affairs of a
colony of heterodox Jews doing business and serving as a military
outpost under Persian control and worshiping their god Yahu in a temple,
in which they made meal, incense, and burnt offerings. When Egyptian
priests destroyed the temple of Yahu in 410 b.c., the Jews appealed for
redress to the Persian governor, under whose patronage the temple was
rebuilt by 399 b.c.

In 1942 an Aramaic papyrus letter that has been dated ca 603/602 b.c.
was discovered at Saqqârah (Memphis). In it the Palestinian king Adon
(of Ashkelon?) sought military aid from Pharaoh Neco II against the
invading armies of the Babylonian Nebuchadrezzar. Other important
Aramaic papyri were discovered in 1962 and 1963 in two caves of the Wâdī
Dâliyeh N of Old Jericho. These texts, dating from 375 to 335 b.c.,
contain about forty fragments of contracts, loan agreements, and other
business documents written in Samaria.

Beginning in 1947 and continuing for more than a decade, Aramaic and
Hebrew manuscripts were found near Qumrân and other ancient sites in the
wilderness of Judea W of the Dead Sea (*see* Dead Sea Scrolls). Although
most of these materials are leather, some are papyrus. The Aramaic
papyri consist chiefly of documentary texts dating from the First and
Second Jewish Revolts. The Hebrew papyri derive largely from the same
periods and contain several remarkable letters of Simon bar Cochba, the
legendary leader of the Second Jewish Revolt against Rome. These finds
near the Dead Sea include the oldest papyrus found outside Egypt, a
Hebrew letter dated ca 750 b.c. found in a cave of *Wâdī Murabba˓ât* (P.
Mur. 17). This letter, reused in antiquity to record a list of
contributors, belongs to the period of King Uzziah’s economic activity
in the Judean desert and the Negeb (2 Ch. 26:2, 7, 10).

V. Other Papyri
===============

**A. Coptic**Coptic papyri have made special contributions to early
Christian literature. C. Schmidt published a considerable Coptic
fragment of the Acts of Paul and a Coptic (Akhmîmic) codex of 1 Clement,
almost complete. Texts of Psalms, Proverbs, and homilies were discovered
at the White Convent near Panopolis (Akhmîm); indeed, biblical papyri in
Coptic are fairly numerous and are being rapidly enriched by such
discoveries as the Bodmer Papyri III (John and Genesis), XVI (Exodus),
XVIII (Deuteronomy), and XIX (Matthew and Romans). The library of Coptic
papyrus codices found near Nag Hammadi in 1945 is a remarkable
collection of Jewish and Christian gnostic writings (*see* Nag Hammadi).

**B. Arabic**Arabic papyri, from the period after the Arab conquest,
a.d. 640, first began to appear from Egypt in 1825 when three pieces
were brought to Paris and published by S. de Sacy. Not until the great
papyrus finds of 1877–1878, however, did any considerable number of
Arabic papyri find their way into Europe. The chief collections are at
Vienna (Rainer Collection), Berlin, and Cairo. Large archives of Arabic
papyri were discovered at the turn of the century in Aswân (Syene). A
few fragments of documentary and magical Arabic papyri from the 10th
cent were found among the manuscripts in *Wâdī Murabba˓ât*.

**C. Latin**Latin papyri are comparatively rare. Of the one hundred
literary papyri that have been published, Vergil’s *Aeneid* is most
frequent, with the works of Cicero next best attested. Latin papyri,
chiefly after Diocletian, were discovered in Egypt, although some texts
came to light at Herculaneum, Dura-Europos in Mesopotamia, and
Palestine. The literary texts are accompanied by Latin-Greek glossaries,
lexica, and grammars reflecting the schools of Roman Egypt. Nonliterary
Latin papyri have become especially valuable in elucidating Roman
military and legal traditions.

VI. Contribution to Biblical Study
==================================

The papyri have made a valuable contribution to textual criticism of
both the OT and the NT. For early Christian literature their testimony
has been of unusual interest (the Oxyrhynchus Logia and Gospel
fragments). Both literay and documentary papyri have illuminated the
religious and cultural environment of the Bible: parallel structures and
expressions in the papyri have made biblical literary forms clearer.

A series of uncial MSS from the six centuries preceding the Codex
Vaticanus bridges the gap between what were the earliest uncials and the
hand of the inscriptions and allows more accurate dating of uncial MSS.
Minuscule or cursive hands, too, so common in the NT MSS of the 10th and
later cents, appeared in a new light when such writing was seen not as a
late invention arising out of the uncial but as the ordinary hand, as
distinguished from the literary or book hand, that had existed side by
side with the uncial from at least the 4th cent b.c. *See* Writing.

The philological contribution of the documentary papyri has been
considerable. Like the NT writings, they reflect the common as
distinguished from the literary language of the times, and words that
had appeared exceptional or unknown in Greek literature have been shown
to have been in common use. The problems of NT syntax are similarly
illuminated.

Specific historical notices sometimes light up dark points in the Bible.
For example, a British Museum decree of Gaius Vibius Maximus, prefect of
Egypt (a.d. 104), ordered all who were out of their districts to return
to their homes in view of the approaching census (cf. Lk. 2:1–5). Most
important of all is the contribution of the papyri to a sympathetic
knowledge of ancient life. They present a veritable gallery of biblical
characters. A strong light is sometimes thrown upon the social evils of
the time, of which Paul and Juvenal wrote so sternly. The child, the
prodigal, the thief, the host with his invitations, the steward with his
accounts, the thrifty householder, the soldier or service receiving his
*viaticum* or retired as a veteran upon his farm, the husbandman, and
the publican, are met at first hand in the papyri, which often they
themselves had written. The worth of this material for the historical
interpretation of the Bible is very great.
