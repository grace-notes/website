**Messiah in the Old Testament 27**

**Messiah in the Old Testament**

from “The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah” by Alfred Edersheim,
Appendix IX.

The following list contains the passages in the Old Testament applied to
the Messiah or to Messianic times in the most ancient Jewish writings.
They amount in all to 456, thus distributed: 75 from the Pentateuch, 243
from the Prophets, and 138 from the Hagiographa, and supported by more
than 558 separate quotations from Rabbinic writings. Despite all labor
care, it can scarcely be hoped that the list is quite complete,
although, it is hoped, no important passage has been omitted. The
Rabbinic references might have been considerably increased, but it
seemed useless to quote the same application of a passage in many
different books. Similarly, for the sake of space, only the most
important Rabbinic quotations have been made are: the Targumim the two
Talmuds, and the most ancient Midrashim, but neither the Zohar (as the
date of its composition is in dispute), nor any other Kabalistic work,
nor yet the younger Midrashim, nor, of course, the writings of later
Rabbis, I have, however, frequently quoted from the well-known work
Yalkut, because, although of comparatively late date, it is really, as
its name implies, a collection and selection from more than fifty older
and accredited writings, and adduces passages now not otherwise
accessible to us. And I have the more readily availed myself of it, as I
have been reluctantly forced to the conclusion that even the Midrashim
preserved to us have occasionally been tampered with for controversial
purposes. I have quoted from the best edition of Yalkut (Frankfort a.
M., 1687), but in the case of the other Midrashim I have been obliged to
content myself with such more recent reprints as I possessed, instead of
the older and more expensive editions. In quoting from the Midrashim,
not only the Parashah, but mostly also the folio, the page, and
frequently even the lines are referred to. Lastly, it only remains to
acknowledge in general that, so far as possible, I have availed myself
of the labours of my predecessors. specially of those of Schottgen. Yet,
even so, I may, in a sense, claim these references also as the result of
my own labours, since I have not availed myself of quotations without
comparing them with the works from which they were adduced, a process in
which not a few passages quoted had to be rejected. And if any student
should arrive at a different conclusion from mine in regard to any of
the passages hereafter quoted, I can at least assure him that mine is
the result of the most careful and candid study I could give to the
consideration of each passage. With these prefatory remarks I proceed to
give the list of Old Testament messianically applied in ancient Rabbinic
writings.

In Gen. i. 2, the expression, ‘Spirit of God,’ is explained of ‘the
Spirit of the King Messiah,’ with reference to Is. xi. 2, and the
‘moving on the face of the deep’ of ‘repentance,’ according to Lam. ii.
19. So in Ber. R. 2, and in regard to the first point also in Ber. R. 8,
in Vayyik. R. 14, and in other places.

Gen. ii. 4: ‘These are the generations, of the heavens and of the
earth,’ taken in connection with Gen. iii. 15 and Ruth iv. 18. Here we
note one of the most curious Messianic interpretations in Ber. R. 12
(ed. Warsh. p. 24 b). It is noted that the word ‘generations’ is always
written in the Bible without the which is the equivalent for the numeral
6, except in Gen. ii. 4 and Ruth iv.18. This to indicate that subsequent
to Gen. ii. 4 the Fall took place, in which Adam lost six things: his
glorious sheen (Job xiv. 20); life (Gen. iii. 19)); his stature (Gen.
iii. 8, either by 100, by 200, by 300, or even by 900 cubits); the fruit
of the ground; the fruits of the trees (Gen. iii. 17); and the heavenly
lights. We have now seen why in Gen. ii. 4, that is, previous to the
Fall, the is still in since at that time these six things were not yet
lost. But the reappears in the word in Ruth iv. 18, because these six
things are to be rstored to man by ‘the son of Pkharez,’ or the Messiah
(comp. for each of these six things:Judg. v. 31 b; Is. lxviii. 22; Lev.
xxvi. 13; Zech. viii. 12; Is. xxx. 26). It is added that although,
according to the literal rendering of Ps. xlix. 12 (in Heb.ver. 13, man
did not remain unfallen one single night, yet, for the sake of the
Sabbath, the heavely lights were not extinguished till after the close
of the Sabbath. When Adam saw the darknes, it is added, he was greatly
afraid, saying: Perhaps he, of whom it is written, ‘he shall bruise thy
head, and thou shalt bruise his heel,’ cometh to molest and attack me,
and he said, ‘Surely the darkness shall cover me.’ This courious extract
at least shown in what context the Synagoue applied Gen. iii. 15. The
same occurs substantially in Shem. R. 30.

Gen iii. 15. This well-known passage is paraphrased, with expresses
reference to the Messiah, in the Targum Pseudo Jonathan and the
so-called jerusalem Targum. Schottgen conjectures that the Talmudic
designation of ‘heels of the Messiah’ (Sot. 49 b, line 2 from top) in
reference to the near Advent of the Messiah in the description of the
trokubles of those days (comp. St. Matt. x. 35, 36) may have been chosen
partly with a view to this passage.

Gen. iv. 25. The language of Eve at the birth of Seth: ‘another seed,’
is explained as meaning ‘seed which comes from another place,’ and
referred to the Messiah in Ber. R. 23 (ed. Warsh. p. 45 b, lines 8, 7
from the bottom). The sameexplanation occurs twice in the Midrash on
Ruth iv. 19 (in the genealogy of David, ed. Warsh. p. 46 b), the second
time in connection with Ps. xl. 8 (’in the volume of the book it is
written of me,’bim’ gillath sepher, Ruth belonging to the class

In connection with Gen. v. 1 it is noted in Ber. R. 24, that King
Messiah will not come till all souls predestined for it have appeared in
human bodies on earth.

In Gen. viii. 11 the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan notes that the olive-leaf,
brought by the dove, was dtaken from the Mount of the Messiah.

Gen. ix. 27. The promise, that Japhet shall dwell in the tents of Shem,
is paraphrased in the Targum Pseudo-Jon. as meaning, that his
descendants should become proselytes, and dwell in the school of Shem,
which seems to refer to Messianic times.

In connection with Gen. xiv. 1, we are reminded in Ber. R. 42, that when
we see the nations warring together, we may expect the coming of the
Messiah.

The promise in Gen. xv. 18 is expected to be finally fulfilled in the
time of Messiah, in Ber. R. 44.

In connection with Gen. xviii. 4, 5 it is noted (Ber. R. 48, ed. Warsh.
p. 87 b) that the words of Abraham to his Angelic guests were to be
returned in blessing to Abraham’s descendants, in the wilderness, in the
land jof Canaan, and in the latter (Messianic) days. Referring only to
this last point, the words ‘let a little water be fetched,’ is
paralleled with the ‘living waters’ in Zech. xiv. 8; ‘wash your feet,’
with Is.iv. 4 (the washing away of the filth of the daughters of zion);
‘rest under the tree,’ with Is. iv. 6: there shall be a tabernacle for a
shadow in the daytime from the heat;’ ‘I will fetch a morsel of bread,’
with the provision, Ps. lxxii. 16: ‘there shall be a handful of corn in
the earth,’ &c. So also the words: ‘Abraham ran unto the here,’ are
paralleled with Is. vii. 21 (which is most significantly here applied to
Messianic times); and lastly, the words, ‘he stoodby them,’ with Mic.
ii. 13: ‘the breaker is come up before them.’ [1 Indeed, this Parashah
in Bedr. R. contains other similar parallelisms between Gen. xvii. and
Messianic times.] The same interpretation occurs in Bemid. R. 14 (ed.
Warsh. p. 55 a), the references to Messianic days there being to Is.
xiv. 2; xxx. 25; xli. 18; vi. 4;and iv. 6.

The last clause of Gen. xix. 32 is interperted (Ber. R. 51, ed. Warsh.
p. 95. a), as referring, like the words of Eve about Seth, to the
Messiah, the sin of the daughters of Lot being explained on the ground
of their believing that all mankind had been destroyed in the judgment
that overthrew Sodom.

The promise in Gen. xxii. 18 is also explained Messianically in Bemid.
R. 2 (ed. W. P. 5 b), in connection with Num. ii. 32 where it is
somewhat curiously shown in what sense Israel is to be like the sand of
the sea.

Gen. xxxiii. 1. The Midrash conjoins this with Is. lxv i. 7, and notes
that, before the first oppressor was born, the last Redeemer was already
born.

In Gen. xxxv. 21 the Targum Pseudo-Jon. paraphrases ‘the tower of Eder’
(at Bethlehm) as the place whence the Messiah would be revealed. On Gen.
xxxviii. 1, 2 there are very remarkable Messiah would comments in Ber.
R. 85.

Gen. xlix. 1. The Targum Pseudo-Jon. notes, that the end for which the
Messhah would come was not revealed to Jacob. A similar statement is
found in the Midrash on the passage (Ber. R. 98, ed. Warsh. p. 173 a),
where it is said of Jacob and Daniel that they saw the end, and yet it
was afterwards hid from them. The passage quoted in the case of Daniel
is Dan. xii. 4.

Gen. xlix 9. The expression ‘lion’s whelp,’ is explained of the Messiah
in Yalkut 160 (vol. i. p. 49 c), no less than five times; while the term
‘he couched,’ is referred to the Messiah in Ber. R. 98.

Gen xlix. 10. This well-known prediction (on which see the full and
intersting disciussion in Raym. Martini, Pugio Fidei) is in Yalkut, u.
s., applied to the Messiah, with a quotation of Ps. ii. 9. This
expression ‘Shiloh’ is also appliedto the Messiah, with the curious
addition, that the latter days all nation would bring gifts to Him.
Alike the Targum Onkelos, PSEUDO-JONATHAN, AND THE Jerusalem Targum, as
well a Sanh. 98 b, the Midrash on the passage, and that on Prov. xix.
21, and on Lam. i. 16, where it is rendered shelo, ‘whose it is,’ refer
the expression ‘Shiloh,’ and, indeed, the whole passage, to the Messiah;
the Midrah Ber. R. (99, ed. Warsh. p. 178 b) with special reference to
Is. xi. 10, while the promise with reference to the ass’s colt is
brought into connection with Zech. ix. 9, the fulfilment of this
prophecy being expected along with that in Ezek. xxxvi. 25 (’I will
sprinkle clean water’). Another remarkable statement occurs in the
Midrash on the passage (Ber. R. 98, ed. Warsh. p. 174 b), which applies
the vere to the coming of Him kof Whom it is written,Zech. ix. 9. Then
He would wash his garment in wine (Gen. xlix. 11), which is explained as
meaning the teaching of the Law to Israel, and His clothes in the blood
of grapes, which is explainedas meaning that He would bring them back
from their errors. One of the Rabbis, however, remarks that Israel would
not require to be taught by the King Messiah in the latter days, since
it was written (Is. xi. 10), ‘to it shall the Gentilesseek.’ If so, then
why should the Messiah. come, and what will He do to the congregation of
Israel? He will redeem Israel, and give them thirty commandments,
according to Zech. xi. 12. The Targum Pseudo-Jon. and the Jer. Targum
also apply verse 11 to the Messiah. Indeed, so general was this
interpretation, that, according popular opinion, to see a palm-tree in
one’s dreams was to see the days of the Messiah (Berach. 57 a).

Gen. xlix. 12 is also applied to the Messiah in the Targum Pseudo-Jon.
and the Jerusalem Targum. So also is verse 18, although not in express
words.

In Gen. xlix. 17, last clause, in its connection with ver. 18, the
Midrash (Ber. R. 98) sees a reference to the disappointment of Jacob in
mistaking Samson for the Messiah.

In the prophecy of Gad in Gen. xlix. 19 there is an allusion to
Messianic days,as Elijah was to be of the tribe of Gad (Ber. R. 99, ed.
Warsh. p. 179 a). Thereis, however, in Ber. R. 71, towards the close, a
dispute whether he was of the tribe of Gad, or of the tribe of Benjamin,
at the close of which Elijah appears, and settles the dispute in a
rather summary manner.

On Gen. 1. 10 the Midrash, at the close of Ber. R., remarks that as they
had mourned, so in Messianic days God would turn their mourning into
joy, quoting Jer. xxxi. 13 and Is. li 3.

Ex. iv. 22 is reffered to the Messiah in the Midr. on Ps. ii. 7.

On Exod. xii. 2, ‘let this be the beginning of months,’ it is remarked
in Shem.R. 15 (ed. Warsh. p. 24 b) that God would make new ten things in
the latter days, these being marked by the following passages: Is lx.
19; Ezek. xlvii. 9; xlvii. 12; Ezek. xvi. 55; Is liv. 11; Is. xi. 7;
Hos. ii. 20; Is. lxv. 19; Is. xxxv. 8; Is. xxxv. 10. Similarly on Num.
xii. 1 we have, in Shem. R. 51, a parallelism between Old Testament
times and their institutions and those of the latter days, to which Is.
xlix. 12 and lx. 8 are suppose to apply.

On Exod. xii. 42 the Jerus. Targum notes that there were 4 remarkable
nights: those of creation, of the covenant with Abraham, of the first
Passover, and of the redemption of the world; and that as Moses came out
of the desert, so would the Messiah come out of Rome.

On Exod. xv. 1. It is noted in Mekhilta (ed. Weiss, p. 41 a) that this
song would be taken up in Messianic days, only with far wide reach, as
explained in Is. lx 5; lviii. 8; xxxv. 5, 6; Jer. xxxi. 13; and
Ps.cxxvi. 2.

Ex. xvi. 25 is applied to the Messiah, it being said that, if Isreal
only kept one sabbath according to the commandment, the Messiah would
immediately come (Jer. Taan. 64 a).

Ex. xvi. 33. This manna, it is noted in Mechil. ed. Weiss, p. 59 b, was
to be preserved for the days of the Messiah. Is. xxx. 15 is similarly
explained in Jer. Taan. i. 1.

Ex. xvii. 16 the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan refers to Messianic times.

Exod. xxi. 1. Shem. R. 30, ed Warsh. p. 44. b, 45 a, notes on the word
‘judgments’ a number of things connected with judgment, showing how
Balaam could not have wished the advent of the future deliverance (Numb.
xxiv. 17), since he was to perish in it; but that Isreal should cleave
to the great hope pressed in Gen. xlix. 18; Is. lvi. 1; lix. 16; and
especially Zech. ix. 9, of which a different redering is proposed.

On Exod. xl. 9, 11 there is in the Targum Pesudo-Jon. distinct reference
to theKing Messiah, on whose account the anointing oil was to be used.

The promise (Lev. xxvi. 12) is also referred to the latter, or
Messianic,days in Yalkut 62 (vol. i. p. 17 b).

Lev. xxvi. 13 is applied to Messianic times. See our remarks on Gen. ii.
4.

The promise of peace in the Aaronic benediction Num. vi. 26 is reffered
to the peace of the Kingdom of David, in accordance with Is. ix. 7
(Sipher on Num. par. 42, ed. Friedmann, p. 12).

Num. vii. 12. In connection with this it is marked that the six
blessings whichwere lost by the Fall are to be restored by the son of
Nahson, i.e. the Messiah (Bem. R. 13, ed. W. p. 51 a).j

In the Jerusalem Targum on Num. xi. 26 the prophecy of Eldad and Medad
is supposed to have been with regard to the war of the later days
against Jerusalemand to the defeat of Gog and Magog by the Messiah.

In Num. xxiii. 21 the term ‘King’ is expressly referred to the Messiah
in Targum Pseudo-Jon. So also Num. xxiv . 7 in the Jer. Targum.

In Num. xxiv. 17 Balaam’s prediction of the Star and Sceptre is referred
to theMessiah in the Targum Onkelos and the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, as
well as in Jer. Taan. iv. 8; Deb. R. 1; Midr. on Lament. ii. 2.
Similarly verses 20 and 24 of that prophecy are ascribed in the Targum
Pseudo-Jon. to the Messiah.

Num. xxvii. 16. In connection with this verse it is noticed that His one
Spiritis worth as much as all other spirits, according to Ia. xi. 1
(Yalkut, vol. i. p. 247 a).

Deut. i. 8 is applied to the days of the Messiah in Sphre, 67 a.

In the comments of Tanchuma on Deut. viii. 1. (ed. Warsh. p. 104 b, 105
a) there are several allusions to Mesianic days.

Deut. xi. 21 is applied in Siphre Par. 47 (ed. Friedmann, p. 83 a) to
the days of the Messiah.

In Deut. xvi. 3 the record of the deliverance from Egypt is supposed to
be carried on to the days of the Messiah, in Spihre, Par. 130 (ed.
Friedmann. p. 101 a). See, also, Ber. i. 5.

On Deut. xix. 8,9 it is noted, in Siphre on Deut., Par. 185 (ed Friedm.
p. 108 b), that as three of these cities were in terrtiory never
possessed by Isreal, this was to be fulfilled in Messianic times. See
also Jer. Macc. ii. 7.

In Tanchuma on Deut. xx. 10 (Par. 19, ed. Warsh. p. 114 b) the offer of
peace to a hostile city is applied to the future action of Messiah to
the Gentiles, inin accordance with Zech. ix, 10; Is. ii. 4; and Ps
lxviii. 32; while, on the other hand, the resistance of a city to the
offer of peace is likened to rebellion against the Messiah, and
consequent judgment, according to Is. xi. 4.

Deut. xiii. 11 is typically applied to the evening of time, when God
would wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion (Is. iv. 4); and the
words: ‘when the sun is down’ to when King Messiah would come (Tanchuma
on Par. Ki Thetse 3 ed. Warsh. p. 115 b).

Deut. xxv. 19 and Deut. xxx. 4 are referred by the Targum Pesudo-Jon.
the Messianic times. In the latter passage the gathering of dispersed
Israel by Elijah, and their being brought back by Messiah, are spoken
of. Comp. also Bem. R., last three lines.

On Deut. xxxii. 7 Siphre (Par. 210, ed Friedm. p. 134 a) makes the
beautiful observation, that in all Israel’s affictions they were to
remember the good and comfortable things which God had promised them for
the furture world, and in connection with this is special reference to
make time of the Messiah.

On Deut. xxxii. 30 Siphre (p. 138 a) marks its fulfilment in the days of
the Messiah.

On Deut. xxxiii. 5 the Jer. Targum speaks of a king whom the tribes of
Israel shall obey, this being evidently the King Messiah.

Deut. xxxiii. 17. Tanchuma on Gen. i. Par. 1 (ed. Warsh. p. 4 a) applies
this to the Messiah. So also in Benidb. R. 14.

Deut. xxxiii. 12. The expression, ‘he shall cover him,’ is reffered to
this world; ‘all the day long,’ to the days of the Messiah; and ‘he
shall dwell between his shoulders,’ to the world to come (Sebach. 118
b).

Judg v. 31: ‘let them that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth in
his might,’ is applied to Messianic times in Ber. R. 12. See our remarks
on Gen. ii.4.

On Ruth ii. 14: ‘come hither at the time of meat,’ the Midr. R. Ruth 5
(ed. Warsh. p. 43 a and b), has a very remarkable interpretation.
Besides the application of the word ‘eat,’ as beyond this present time,
to the days of the Messiah, and again to the world to come, which is to
follow these days, the Midrash applies the whole of it mystically to the
Messiah, viz. ‘Come hither,’ that is, draw near to the kingdom, ‘and eat
of the bread,’ that is, the bread of royalty, ‘and dip thy morsel in
vinegar,’ these are the sufferings, as it is written in Is. liii. 5, ‘He
was wounded for our transgression.’ ‘And she sat beside the reapers’,
because His Kingdom would in the further be put aside from Him for a
short time, according to Zech. xiv. 2; ‘and he reached her parched
corn’, because He will restore it to Him, according to Is. xi. 4. R.
Berachiah, in the name of R. Levi, adds, thatthe second Redeemer should
be like the first. As the firrst Redeemer (Moses) appeared, and
disappeared, and reappeared after three months, so the second Redeemer
would also appear, and siappear, and again become manifest, Dan. xii.
11, 12 being brought into connection with it. Comp. Midr. on Cant. ii.
6; Pesik. 49 a, b. Again, the words, ‘she ate, and was sufficed, and
left,’ are thus interpreted inShabb. 113 b: she ate, in this world; and
was sufficed, in the days of the Messiah; and left, for the world to
come.

Again, the Targum on Ruth i. 1 speaks of the Messiah; and again on Ruth
iii. 15 paraphrases the six measures of barley as reffering to six
righteous ones, ofwhich the last was the Messiah, and who were each to
have six special blessings.

Ruth iv. 18. The Messiah is called ‘the son of Pharez,’ who restores
what had been lost to humanity through the fall of Adam. See our remarks
on Gen. ii. 4.

The meszianic interpretation of Ruth iv. 20 has already been given under
Gen. iv. 25.

1 Sam. ii. 10. The latter clause of this promise is understood by the
Targum (and also is some of the Medrashim) as applying to the Kingdom of
the Messiah.

2 Sam. xxii. 28. In a Talmudic passage (Sanh. 98 a, line 19, &c., from
the bottom), which contains many references to the coming of the
Messiah, His adventis predicted in connection with this passage.

2 Sam. xxii. 1 is applied by the Targum to the prophecy of David
concerning the latter Messianic days.

2 Sam. xxiii. 3. The ‘ruling in the fear of God’ is referred in the
Targum to the future raising up of the Messiah.

In 2 Sam. xxiii. 4 the morning light at sunrise is explained in the
Midrash on the passage (par. 29, ed. Lemberg, p, 56 b, lines 7-9 from
the top), as applying to the appearance of the Messiah.

The expression, 1 Kings iv. 33, that Solomon spoke of trees, is referred
in theTargum to his prophecy concerning kings that were to reign in this
age, and in that of the Messiah.

On the name ‘Anani,’ in Chr. ii. 24, the Targum remarks that this is the
Messiah, the interpretation being that the word anani is connected with
the wordsimilarly written (not punctuated) in Deut. vii. 13, and there
translated ‘clouds,’ of which the explanation is given in Tanchuma (Par.
Toledoth 14, p. 27 b).

Ps. ii. as might be expected, is treated fas full of Messianic
references. To begin with. Ps. ii. 1 is applied to the wars of Gog and
Magog in the Talmud (Berach. 7 b and Abhod. Zarah 3 b), and also in the
Midrash on Ps. ii. Similarly, verse 2 is applied to the Messiah in
Abhod. Zach, u. s., in the Midrash on Ps. xcii. 11 (ed. Warsh. p. 70 b,
line 8 from the top); in Pirque de R. Eliez. c. 28 (ed. Lemberg,p. 33 b,
line 9 from top). In Yalkut (vol. ii. par. 620, p. 90 a, line 12 from
the bottom), we have the following remarkable simile on the words,
‘against God, andHis Messiah,’ likening them to a robber who stands
defiantly behind the palace of the king, and says, If I shall find the
son of the king, I shall lay hold on him. and crucify him, and kill him
with a cruel death. But the Holy Spirit mocks at him, ‘He that sitteth
in the heavens shall laugh.’ On the same verse the Midrashon Ps. ii. has
a curious conceit, intended to show that each who rose against God and
His people thought he was wiser than he who had preceded him. If Cain
had killed his brother while his father was alive, forgetful that there
would beother son, Esau proposed to wait till after his father’s death.
Pharaoh, again, blamed Esau for his folly in forgetting that in the
meantime Jacob would have children, and hence porposed to kill all the
male children, while Haman, ridiculing Pharaoh’s folly in forgetting
that there were daughters set himself to destroy the whole people; and,
in turn, Gog and Magog, ridiculing the shortsightedness of all, who had
preceded them, in taking counsel against Israel so long as they had a
Patron in heaven, resolved first to attack their heavenly Patron, and
after thatIsrael. To which apply the words, ‘against the Lord, and
against His Anointed.’

But to return Ps. ii. 4 is Messianically applied in the Talmud (Abhod.
Z. u. s.). Ps. ii. 6 is applied to the Messiah in the Midrash on 1
Samuel xvi. 1 (Par. 19, ed, Lemberg, p. 45 a and b), where it is said
that of the three measures of s sufferings [1 As to these three measures
of sufferings, and the share falling tothe age of the Messiah sea also
the Midrash on Ps. ii. 7.] one goes to the King Messiah, of whom it is
written (Is. liii.) ‘He was wounded for our trangression.’ The say to
the King Messiah: Where dost Thou seek to dwell? He answers: Is this
question also necessary? In Sion My holy hill (Ps. ii. 6). (Comp. also
Yalkut ii. p. 53 c.)

Ps. ii. 7 is quoted as Messianic in the Talmud, among a number of other
Messianic quotations (Sukk. 52 a). There is a very remarkable passage in
the Midrash on Ps. ii. 7 (ed. Warsh p. 5 a), in which the unity of
Israel and the Messiah in prophetic vision seems clearly indicated.
Tracing the ‘decree’ through the Law, the Prophets, and the Hagiograph,
the first passage quoted in Exod. iv 22: ‘Israel is My first-born son;’
the second, from the Prophets, Is. lii. 13: ‘Behold My servants shall
deal prudently,’ and Is. xlii. 1: Behold My My servant, whom I uphold;’
the third, from the Hagiographa, Ps. cx. 1: ‘The Lord said unto my
Lord,’ and again, Ps. ii. 7: ‘The Lord said unto Me, Thou art My Son,’
and yet this other saying (Dan. vii. 13): ‘Behold, one like the Son of
Man came with theclouds of heaven.’ Five lines further down, the same
Midrash, in reference to the words ‘Thou art My Son,’ observes that,
when that hour comes, God speaks to Him to make a new convenant, and
thus He speaks: ‘This day have I begotten There’, this is the hour in
which He become His Son.

Ps. ii. 8 is applied in Ber. R. 44 (ed. Warsh. p. 80 a) and in the
Midrash on the passage, to the Messiah, with the curious remark that
there were three of whom it was said ‘Ask of Me’, Solomon, Ahaz, [1 The
Midrash gives two very curious explanations of his name.] and the
Messiah. In the Talmud (Shukk. 52 a) the same passage is very curiously
applied, it being suggested that, when the Messiah, the Son of David,
saw that the Messiah, the Son of Joseph, [2 On the twofold Messiah, or
rather the device of the Jews on this subject, see in the text of the
chapter. I cannot but suspect that the words ‘Son of Joseph’ in the
Talmud are a later and clumsy emendation, since what follows evidently
applies to the Son of David.] would be killed, He said to the Almighty,
I seek nothing of Thee except life. To which the reply was: Life before
Thou hadst spoken, as David Thy father prophesied of Thee, Ps. xxi. 4.

Ps. ii. 9 will be reffered to in our remarks on Ps. cxx.

Ps. xvi. 5 is discussed in Ber. R. 88, in connection with the cup which
Pharaoh’s butler saw in his dream. From this the Midrash proceeds to
speak of the four cups appointed for the Passover night, and to explain
their meaning in various manners, among others, contrasting the four
cups of fury, which God would make the nations drink, with the four cups
of salvation which He would give Israel inthe latter days, viz. Ps. xvi.
5; Ps. cxvi. 13; Ps. xxiii. 5. The expression, Ps. cxvi. 13, rendered in
our A. V. ‘the cup of salvation,’ is in the orginal, ‘the cup of
salvations’, and is explainedd as implying on e for the days of the
Messiah, andthe other for the days of Gog.

On verse 9, the Midrash on the passage says: ‘My glory shall rejoice in
the King Messiah, Who in the furture shall come forth from me, as it is
written in Is. iv. 5: “upon all the glory a convering.”’ And the Midrash
continues ‘my flesh also shall dwell in saftey’, i.e. after death, to
teach us that corruption and the worm shall not rule over it.

Ps. xviii. 31 (in the Heb. verse 32). The Targum explains this in
reference to the works and miracles of the Messiah.

Ps. xviii. 50 is reffered in Jer. Talmud (Ber. ii. 4, p. 5 a, line 11
from the top), and in the Midr. on Lam. i. 16, to the Messiah, with this
curious remark, implying the doubt whether He was alive or dead: ‘The
king Messiah, whether He belong to the living or the dead, His Name is
to be David, according to Ps. xviii. 50.’ Targum to be King Messiah. The
Midrash on the passage indenfies him with Is. xi. 10, on which Rabbi
Chanina adds that the object of the Messiah is to give certain
commandments to the Gentiles (not to Israel, who are to learn from God
Himself), accordding to the passage in Isaiah above qutoed, adding that
the words ‘his rest shall be glorious’ mean that God gives to the King
Messiah from the glory above, as it is said: ’In Thy strength shall the
king rejoice, ’which strength is a little afterwards explained as the
Kigdom (ed. Warsh. p. 30 a and b).

Verse 3 is Messianically applied in the Midrash on the passage.

Ps. xxi. 3 (4 in the Hebrew). Only a few lines farther down in the same
Midrash, among remarkable Messianic applications, is that of this vese
to the Messiah, where also the expression ‘Jehovah is a man of war,’ and
‘Jehovah Zidkenu,’ are applied to the Messiah. [3 The idea of an organic
connection between Israel and the Messiah seems also to underlie this
passage.] Comp. also Shemoth R. 8, where it is noted that God will corwn
Him with His own crown.

Verse 4 is Messianically applied in Sukk. 52 a.

Ps. xxi. 5 (6 in the Hebrew). The first clause is the vese Yalkut on
Num. xxvii. 20 (vol. i. p. 248 a, line 10 from the bottom) applies to
the glory of the king Messiah, immediately quoting the second clause in
proof of its Messianic application. This is also does in the Midrash on
the passage. But perhaps one ofthe most remarkable applications of it is
in Bemidbar R. 15, p. 63 b, where the passage is applied to the Messiah.

Finally in Ps. xxi. 7 (8 in the Hebrew), the expression ‘king’ is
applied in the Targum to the Messiah.

On the whole, then, it may be remarked that Ps. xxi. was throughout
regarded as Messianic.

On Ps. xxii. 7 (8 in the Hebrew) a remarkable comment appears in Yalkut
on Is. lx., applying this passage to the Messiah (the second, or son of
Ephraim), and using almost the same words in which the Evangelists
describe the mocking behaviour of the Jews at the Cross.

Ps. xxii. 15 (16 in the Hebrew). There is a similarly remarkable
application ofto the Messiah of this verse in Yalkut.

The promise in Ps. xxii. 5 is referred in Benid. R. 21 to the spreding
of the great feast before Israel in the latter days.

Ps. xxi. 19 (20 in the Hebrew) is in the Midrash applied to the reward
that in the latter days Israel would receive for their faithfulness.
Also in Pesiqta,p. 149 b, to the joy of Israel in the presence of the
Messiah.

The expression in Ps. xxxvi. 9, ‘In Thy light shall we see light,’ is
applied to the Messiah in Yalkut on Isaiah lx. (vol. ii. p. 56 c, line
22 from the bottom).

The application of Ps. sl. 7 to the Messiah has already been noted in
our remarks on Gen. iv. 25.

Ps. xlv. is throughout regarded as Messianic. To begin with; the Targum
renders verse 2 (3 in the Hebrew): ‘Thy beauty, O King Messiah, is
greater than that of the sons of men.’

Verse 3 (4 in the Hebrew) is applied in the Talmud (Shabb 63 a) to the
Messiah, although other interpretations of that verse immediately
follow.

The application of verse 6 (7 in the Hebrew), to the Messiah in a MS.
copy of the Targum has already been referred to in another part of his
book, while the words, ‘Thy throne if for ever and ever’ are brought
into connection with the promise that the sceptre would not depart from
Judah in Ber. R. 99, ed. Warsh. p. 178 b,line 9 from the bottom.

On verse 7 the Targum though not in the Venice edition (1568), has:
‘Thou O King Messiah because Thou lovest righteousness,’ &c. Comp. Levy,
Targum. Worterb. vol. ii. p. 41 a.

The Midrash on the Psalm deals exclusively with the inscription (of
which it has several and significant interpretations) with the opening
words of the Psalm, and with the words (ver. 16), ’Instead of thy
fathers shall be thy children, ’but atthe same time it clearly indicates
that the Psalm applies to the latter, or Messianic, days.

On Ps. l. 2 Siphre (p. 143 a) notes that four times God would appear,
the last being in the days of King Messiah.

Ps. lx. 7. Bemidbar R. on Num. vii. 48, Parash. 14 (ed. Warsh p. 54 a)
containssome very curious Haggadic discussion on this verse. But it also
broaches the opinion of its reference to the Messiah.

Ps. lxi. 6 (7 in the Hebrew). ‘Thou shalt add days to the days of the
king,’ isrendered by the Targum: ‘Thou shalt add days to the days of
King Messiah.’ There is a curious gloss on this in Pirque d. R. Eliez.
c. 19 (ed. Lemberg, p. 24 b), in which Adam is supposed to have taken 70
of his years, and added them to those of King David. According to
another tradition, this accounts for Adam living 930 years, this is, 70
less than 1,000, which constitute before God one day, and so the
threatening had been literally fulfilled: In the day thou eatest
thereof, thou shalt die.

Ps. lxi. 8 (9 in the Hebrew). The expression, ‘that I may daily perform
my vows,’ is applied in the Targum to the day in which the Messiah is
anointed King.

Ps. lxviii. 31 (32 in the Hebrew). On the words ‘Princes shall come out
of Egypt,’ there is a very remarkable comment in the Talmud (Pes. 118b)
and in Shemoth R. on Ex. xxvi. 15, &c. (ed. Warsh. p. 50 b), in which we
are told that in the latter days all nations would bring gifts to the
King Messiah, beginning with Egypt. ‘And lest it be thought that He
(Messiah) would not accept it from them, the Holy One says to the
Messiah: Accept from them hospitable entertainment,’ or it might be
rendered, ‘Accept it from them; they have given hospitable entertainment
to My son.’

Ps. lxxii. This Psalm also was viewed by the ancient Synagogue as
throughout Messianic, as indicated by the fact that the Targum renders
the very first verse: ‘Give the sentence of Thy judgment to the King
Messiah, and Thy justice to the Son of David the King,’ which is
re-echoed by the Midrash on the passage (ed. Warsh. p. 55 b) which
applies it explicitly to the Messiah, with reference to Is. xi. 1.
Similarly, the Talmud applies ver. 16 to Messianic times (in a very
hyperbolical passage, Shabb. 30 b, line 4 from the bottom). The last
clause of verse 16 is applied, in Keth. 111 b, line 21 from top, and
again in the Midr. on Eccl. i. 9,to the Messiah sending down manna like
Moses. [1 See the passage in Sanh. 96 b &c. given at the close of this
Appendix.]

Verse 17. In Sanh. 98 b; Pes. 54 a; Ned. 39 b, the various names of the
Messiahare discussed, and also in Ber. R. 1; in Midr. on Lam. i. 16, and
in Pirqe de R.Eliez. c. 3. One of these is stated to be Jinnon,
according to Ps. lxxii. 17.

Verse 8 is applied in Pirqe de R. El. c. 11, to the Messiah. Yalkut
(vol. ii.).on Is. lv. 8 (p. 54 c), speaks of the ‘other Redeemer’ as the
Messiah, applying to him Ps. lxxii. 8.

In commenting on the meeting of Jacob and Esau, the Midr. Ber. R. (78,
ed. Warsh. p. 141 b) remarks that all the gifts which Jacob gave to
Esau, the nations of the world would return to the King Messiah, proving
it by a reference to Ps. lxxii. 10; while in Midrash Bemidbar R. 13 it
is remarked that as the nations brought gifts to Solomon, so they would
bring them to the King Messiah.

In the same place, a little higher up, Solomon and the Messiah are
likened as reigning over the whole world, the proof passages being,
besides others, Ps. lxxii. 8, Daniel vii. 13, and ii. 35.

On the application to the Messiah of verse 16 we have already spoken, as
also on that of verse 17.

Ps. lxxx. 17 (in the Hebrew 18). The Targum paraphrases ‘the Son of Man’
by ‘King Messiah.’

Ps. lxxxix. 22-25 (23-26 in the Hebrew). In Yalkut on Is. lx. 1 (vol.
ii. p. 56c) this promise is referred to the future deliverance of Israel
by the Messiah.

Again, verse 27 (28 in the Hebrew) is applied in Shemoth R. 19, towards
the end, to the Messiah, special reference being made to Ex. iv. 22,
‘Israel is My first-born son.’

Verse 51 (52 in the Hebrew). There is a remarkable comment on this in
the Midrash on the inscription of Ps. xviii. (ed. Warsh. p. 24 a, line 2
from the bottom), in which it is set forth that as Israel and David did
not sing till the hour of perse cution and reproach, so when the Messiah
shall come, ‘speedily, in our days’, the song will not be raised until
the Messiah is put to reproach, according to Ps. lxxxix. 52 (51), and
till there shall fall before Him the wicked idolaters referred to in
Dan. ii. 42, and the four kingdoms referred to in Zech. xiv. 2. In that
hour shall the song be raised, as it is written Ps. xcviii. 1.

In the Midr. on Cant. ii. 13 it is said: If you see one generation after
another blaspheming, expect the feet of the King Messiah, as it is
written, Ps. lxxxix. 53.

Ps. xc. 15. The Midr. (ed. Warsh. p. 67 b) remarks: The days wherein
Thou hast afflicted us, that is, the days of the Messiah. Upon which
follows a discussion upon the length of days of the Messiah, R. Eliezer
holding that they are 1,000 years, quoting the words ‘as yesterday,’ one
day being 1,000 years. R. Joshua holds that they were 2,000 years, the
words ‘the days’ implying that there were two days. R. Berachiah holds
that they were 600 years, appealing to Is. lxv. 22,because the root of
the tree perishes in the earth in 600 years. R. Jose thinks that they
are 60 years, according to Ps. lxxii. 5, the words ‘throughout all
generations’ (dor dorim) being interpreted: Dor = 20 years; Dorim = 40
years: 20 + 40 = 60. R. Akiba says: 40 years, according to the years in
the wilderness. The Rabbis say: 354 years, according to the days in the
lunar year. R. Abahu thinks 7,000 years,reckoning the 7 according to the
days of the bridegroom.

On Ps. xc. the Midrash concludes by drawing a contrast between the
Temple which men built, and which was destroyed, and the Temple of the
latter or Messianic days, which God would build, and which would not be
destroyed.

Ps. xcii., verses 8, 11, and 13 (7, 10, and 12 in our A. V.), are
Messianicallyinterpreted in Pirque de R. El. c. 19. In the Midrash on
verse 13 (12 in our A. V.), among other beautiful applications of the
figure of the Psalm, is that to the Messiah the Son of David. The note
of the Midrash on the expression ‘like a cedar of Lebanon,’ as applied
to Israel, is very beautiful, likening it to the cedar, which, although
driven and bent by all the winds of heaven, cannot be rooted up from its
place.

Ps. xcv. 7, last clause. In Shem. R. 25 and in the Midrash on Cant. v. 2
(ed. Warsh. p. 26 a), it is noted that, if Israel did penitence only one
day [or elseproperly observed even one Sabbath], the Messiah the Son of
David would immediately come. [The whole passage from which this
reference is taken is exceedingly interesting. It introduces God as
saying to Israel: My son, open to Me a door of penitence only as small
as a needle’s eye, and I will open to you doors through which carriages
and waggons shall come in. It almost seems a counterpart to the
Saviour’s words (Rev. iii. 20): ‘Behold, I stand at the door and knock;
if any man hear My voice and open the door, I will come in to Him.’]
Substantially the same view is taken in Sanh. 98 a, where the tokens of
the coming of the Messiah are described, and also in Jer. Taan. 64 a.
Ps. cii. 16 (17 in the Hebrew) is applied in Bereshith R. 56 (ed. Warsh.
p. 104b) to Messianic times.

Ps. cvi. 44. On this there is the Midrash a long Messianic discussion,
setting forth the five grounds on which Israel is redeemed: through the
sorrows of Israel through prayer, through the merits of the patriarchs,
through repentance towardsGod, and in the time of ‘the end.’ Ps. cx. is
throughout applied to the Messiah. To begin with, it evidently underlies
the Targumic of ver. 4. Similarly, it is propounded in the Midr. on Ps.
ii. (although there the chief application of it is to Abraham). But in
the Midrash on Ps. xviii. 36 (35 in our A. V.), Ps. cx. verse 1, ‘Sit
thou at My right hand’ is specially applied to the Messiah, while
Abraham is said to be seated at the left.

Verse 2, ‘The rod of Thy strength.’ In a very curious mystic
interpretation of the pledges which Tamar had, by the Holy Ghost, asked
of Judah, the seal is interpreted as signifying the Kingdom, the
bracelet as the Sanhedrin, and the staff as the King Messiah, with
special reference to Is. xi. and Ps. cx. 2 (Beresh. R. 85, ed. Warsh. p.
153 a) Similarly in Bemid. R. 18, last line, the staff of Aaron, which
is said to have been in the hands of every king till the Temple was
destroyed, and since then to have been hid, is to be restored to King
Messiah, according to this verse; and in Yalkut on this Psalm (vol. ii.
Par. 869, p. 124 c) this staff is supposed to be the same as that of
Jacob with which he crossed Jordan, and of Judah, and of Moses, and of
Aaron, and the same which David had in his hand when he slew Goliath, it
being also the same which will be restored to the Messiah.

Verse 7 is also applied in Yalkut (u. s. col. d) to Messianic times,
when streams of the blood of the wicked should flow out, and birds come
to drink of that flood.

Ps. cxvi. 9 is in Ber. R. 96 supposed to indicate that the dead of
Palestine would live first in the days of the Messiah.

Ps. cxix. 33 the Midrash remarks that there were three who asked wisdom
of God: David, Solomon, and the King Messiah, the latter according to
Ps. lxxii. 1.

Ps. cxx. 7 is applied to the Messiah in the Midrash (p. 91 a, ed.
Warsh.), the first clause being brought into connection with Is. lvii.
19, with reference to the Messiah’s dealings with the Gentiles, the
resistance being described in the second clause, and the result in Ps.
ii. 9.

Ps. cxxi. 1 is applied in Tanchuma (Par. Toledoth 14, ed. Warsh. p. 37
b. See also Yalkut, vol. ii. 878, p. 127 c) to the Messiah, with special
reference to Zech. iv. 7 and Is. lii. 7.

Ps. cxxvi. 2. In Tanchuma on Ex. xv. i. (ed. Warsh. p. 87 a) this verse
is applied to Messianic times in a rapt description, in which
successively Is. lx. 5, Is. lviii. 8, Is. xxxv. 5. 6, Jer. xxxi. 13, and
Ps. cxxvi. 2, are grouped together as all applying to these latter days.

The promise in Ps. cxxxii. 18 is applied in Pirke de R. El. c. 28 to
Messianic times, and verse 14 in Ber. R. 56.

So is Ps. cxxxiii. 3 in Ber. R. 65 (p. 122 a), closing lines.

The words in Ps. cxlii. 5 are applied in Ber. R. 74 to the resurrection
of Israel in Palestine in the days of Messiah.

The words, ‘When thou awakest,’ in Prov. vi. 22 are Messianically
applied in Siphre on Deut. (ed. Friedmann, p. 74 b).

In Midr. on Eccl. i. 9 it is shown at great length that the Messiah
would re-enact all the miracles of the past.

The last clause of Eccl. i. 11 is applied to the days of the Messiah in
the Targum.

Eccl. vii. 24 is thus paraphrased in the Targum: ‘Behold, it is remote
from the sons of men that they should know what was done from the
beginning of the world, but a mystery is the day of death, and the day
when shall come King Messiah, who can find it out by his wisdom?’

In the Midr. on Eccl. xi. 8 it is noted that, however many years a man
might study, his learning would be empty before the teaching of Messiah.
In the Midr. on Eccl. xii. 1 it is noted that the evil days are those of
the woes of Messiah.

Canticles. Here we have first the Talmudic passage (Sheb. 35 b) in which
the principle is laid down, that whenever throughout that book Solomon
is named, except in chap. viii. 12, it applies, not to Solomon, but to
Him Who was His peace (there is here a play on these words, and on the
name Solomon).

To Cant. i. 8 the Targum makes this addition: ‘They shall be nourished
in the captivity, until the time that I shall send to them the King
Messiah, Who will feed them in quietness.’

So also on verse 17 the Targum contrasts the Temple built by Solomon
with the far superior Temple to be built in the days of the Messiah, of
which the beams were to be made of the cedars of Paradise.

Cant. ii. 8, although applied by most authorities to Moses, is by others
referred to the Messiah (Shir haShirim R., ed. Warsh., p. 15 a, about
the middle; Pesiqta, ed. Buber, p. 47 b). Cant. ii. 9 is Messianically
applied in Pesiqta, ed. Buber,p. 49, a and b.

The same may be said of verse 10; while in connection with verse 12, in
similarapplication, Is. lii. 7 is quoted.

In connection with verse 13, in the same Midrash (p. 17 a), Rabbi Chija
bar Abba speaks of a great matter as happening close to the days of the
Messiah, viz., that the wicked should be destroyed, quoting in regard to
it Is. iv. 3.

Cant. iii. 11, ‘the day of his espousals.’ In Yalkut on the passage
(vol. ii. p. 178 d) this is explained: ‘the day of the Messiah, because
the Holy One, blessed be His name, is likened to a bridegroom; “as the
bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride”’, and ‘the day of the gladness of
his heart,’ as the day when the Sanctuary is rebuilt, and Jerusalem is
redeemed.

On Cant. iv. 5 the Targum again introduces the twofold Messiah, the one
the sonof David, and the other the son of Ephraim.

Cant. iv. 16. According to one opinion in the Midrash (p. 25 b, line 13
from the bottom) this applies to the Messiah, Who comes from the north,
and builds the Temple, which is in the south. See also Bemidbar R. 13,
p. 48 b.

On Cant. v. 10 Yalkut remarks that He is white to Israel, and red to the
Gentiles, according to Isaiah lxiii. 2.

On Cant. vi. 10 Yalkut (vol. ii. p. 184 b) has some beautiful
observations, first, likening Israel in the wilderness, and God’s mighty
deeds there, to the morning;and then adding that, according to another
view, this morning-light is the redemption of the Messiah: For as, when
the morning rises, the darkness flees before it, so shall darkness fall
upon the kingdoms of this world when the Messiah comes. And yet again,
as the sun and moon appear, so will the Kingdom of the Messaih also
appear, the commentation going on to trace farther illustrations.

Cant. vii. 6. The Midrash thus comments on it (among other
explanations): How fair in the world to come, how pleasant in the days
of the Messiah!

On Cant. vii. 13, the Targum has it: ‘When it shall please god to
deliver His people from capitivity, then shall it be said to the
Messiah: The time of captivity is past, and the merit of the just shall
be sweet before Me like the odour of balsam.’

Similarly on Cant. viii.1, the Targum has it: ‘And at that shall the
King Messiah be revealed to the congragation of Israel, and the children
of Israel shall say to Him, Come and be a brother to us, and let us go
up to Jerusalem, and there suck with thee the meaning of the Law, as an
infant its mother’s breast.’

On Cant. viii. 2 the Targum has it : ‘I will take Thee, O King Messiah,
and make thee go up into my Temple, there Thou shalt teach me to tremble
before the Lord,and to walk in His ways. There we shall hold the feast
of leviathan, and drink the old wine, which has been kept in its grapes
from the day the world was created, and of the pomegranates and of the
fruits which are prepared for the just in the Garden of Eden.’

On verse 4 the Targum says: ‘The King Messiah shall say: I adjure you,
My people, house of Israel, why should you rise against the Gentiles, to
go out of captivity, and why should you rebel against the might of Gog
and Magog? What a little, till those nations are consumed which go up to
fight against Jerusalem, and then shall the Lord of the world remember
you, and it shall be His good will to set you free.’

Chap. viii. 11 is applied Messianically in the Talmud (Shebhu. 35 b),
and so isverse 12 in the Targum.

It should, however, be remarked that there are many other Messianic
references in the comments on the Song of Solomon.)

Is. i. 25, 26, is thus explained in the Talmud (Sanh. 98 a): ‘The Son of
David shall not come till all the judges and rulers in Israel shall have
ceased.’ ’Similarly Is. ii. 4 is Messianically interpreted in Shabb. 63
a.

Is. iv. 2 the Targum distinctly applies to the times of the Messiah.

Is. iv. 4 has been already commented upon in our remarks on Gen. xviii.
4, 5, and again on Deut. xxiii. 11.

Verses 5 and 6 are brought into connection with Israel’s former service
in contributing to, and making the Tabernacle in the wilderness, and it
is remarkedthat in the latter days God would return it to them by
covering them with a cloud of glory. This, in Yalkut (vlo. i. p. 99 c),
and in the Midrash on Ps. xiii., as also in that on ps. xvi. 9.

Is. vi. 13 is referred in the Talmud (Keth. 112 b) to Messianic times.

The referrence of Is. vii. 21 to Messianic times has already been
discussed in our notes on Gen. xviii. 7.

Is. viii.14 is also Messianically applied in the Talmud (Sanh. 38 a).

Is. ix. 6 is expressly applied to the Messiah in the Targum, and there
is a very curious comment in Debarim R. 1 (ed. Warsh., p. 4 a) in
connection with a Haggadic discussion of Gen. xliii. 14, which, however
fanciful, makes a Messianic application of this passage, also in
Bemidbar R. 11.

Verse 7, ‘Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no
end,’ has already been referred to in our comments on Num. vi. 26.

Is. x. 27 is the Targum applied to the destruction of the Gentiles
before the Messiah. Is. x. 34, is quoted in the Midrash on Lam. i. 16,
in evidence that some-how the birth of the Messiah was to be connected
with the destruction of the Temple.

Is. xi., as will readily be believed, is Messianically interpreted in
Jewish writings. Thus, to begin with in the Targum on verse i and 6; in
the Talmud (Jer. Berach. 5 a and Sanh. 93 b); and in a number of
passages in the Midrashim.Thus, verse 1 in Bereshith R. 85 on Gen.
xxxviii. 18, where also Ps. cx. 2 is quoted, and in Ber. R. 99, ed.
Warsh., p, 178 b. In Yalkut (vol. i. p. 247 d, near the top), where it
is described how God had shown Mosses all the spirits of the rulers
andprophets in Israel, from that time forward to the Resurrection, it is
said that all these had one knowledge and one spirit, but that the
Messiah had one spirit which was equal to all the others put together,
according to Is. xi. 1.

On the 2nd verse see our remarks on Gen. i. 2, while in Yalkut on Prov.
iii. 19, 20 (vol. ii. p. 133 a) the verse is quoted in connection with
Messianic times, when by wisdom, understanding, and knowledge the Temple
will be built again. On that verse see also pirg. d. R. El. 3.

On Is. xi. 3 the Talmud (Sanh. 93 b, lines 21 &c. from the top) has a
curious explanation. After quoting ch. xi. 2 as Messianic, it makes a
play on the words,’of quick understanding,’ or ‘scent,’ as it mights be
rendered, and suggest that this word is intended to teach us that God
has laden Him with commandments and sufferings like millstones.
Immediately afterwards, from the expression ‘He shall not judge after
the sight of His eyes, but reprove with equity for the meek of the
earth,’ it is inferred that the Messiah knew the thoughts of the heart,
and it is added that, as Bar Kokhabh was unable to do this, he was
killed.

Verse 4, ‘he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth,’ is
Messianicallyapplied in the Midrash on Ps. ii. 2, and in that on Ruth
ii. 14, also in Yalkut on Is. lx.

Verse 7 has been already noticed in connection with Ex. xii. 2.

On verse 10 see our remarks on Gen. xlix. 10 and Ps. xxi, 1.

Verse 11 is Messianically applied in Yalkut (vlo. i. p. 31 b and vol.
ii. 38 a), as also in the Midrash on Ps. cvii. 2.

Verse 12 is Messianically applied in that curious passage in the Midrash
on Lamentations i. 2, where it is indicated that, as the children of
Israel sinned from to, so God would in the latter days comfort them from
to (i.e. through the whole aplhabet). Scripture passages being in each
case quoted.

The Messianic application of Is. xii. 3 is sufficiently established by
the ancient symbolic practice of pouring out the water on the Feast of
Tabernacles.

In connection with Is. xi. 5 the Midrash on Ps. cxviii. 23 first speakes
of thewonderment of the Egyptians when they saw the change in Israel
from servitude toglory of their Exdous, and then adds, that the words
were intended by his Holy Ghost to apply to the wonders of the latter
days (ed. Warsh. p. 85 b).

On is. xiv. 2, see our comments on Gen. xviii. 4, 5.

Is. xiv. 29, xv. 2, xvi. 1, and xvi. 5 are Messianically applied in the
Targum.

Is. xviii. 5 is similarly applied in the Talmud (Sanh. 98 a); and is.
xxiii, 15in Sanh. 99 a.

Is. xxi. 11, 12 is in Jer. Taan. 64 a, and in Shem. R. 18, applied to
the manifestation of Messiah.

Is. xxiii. 8 the Midr. on Eccl. i. 7 sees a curious reference to the
return of this world’s wealth to Israel in Messianic days.

Is. xxiii. 18 is Messianically applied in the Talmud (Sanh 99 a) where
the expression ‘a king’ is explained as referring to the Messiah.

Is. xxiv. 23 is Messianically applied in the curious passage in Bemidbar
R. quoted under Gen. xxii. 18; also in Bemidbar R. 13 (ed. Warsh. p. 51
a).

The remarkable promise in Is. xxv. 8 is applied to the times of the
Messiah in the Talmud (Moed Q. 28 b), and in that most ancient
commentary Siphra, (Yalkyt i. p. 190 d applies the passage to the world
to come). But the most remarkable interpretation is that which occurs in
connection with is. lx. 1 (Yalkut ii. 56 c, line 16 from the bottom),
where the passage (Is. xxv. 8) is after an expostulation on the part of
Satan with regard to the Messiah, applied to the casting into Gehenna of
Satan and of the Gentiles. See also our remarks on Ex. xii. 2. In Debar.
R. 2, Isaiah xxv. 8 is applied to the destruction of the Jester ha-Ra
and the abolishing of death in Messianic days; in Shem. R. 30 to the
time of the Messiah.

Verse 9. Tanchuma on Deuteronomy opens with a record of how God would
work all the miracles, which He had shown in the wilderness, in a fuller
manner of Zion in the latter days, the last passage quoted in that
section being Is. xxv. 9. (Tanchuma on Deut. ed. Warsh. p. 99 a, line 5
from the bottom).

Of Is. xxxvi. 19 there is Messianic application in the Midrash on
Ecclesiates i. 7.

Of Is. xxvi. 10 Shem. R. 1, and Tanchuma on Exod. ii. 5 (ed. Warsh. p.
64 b) remark that, like Moses, the Messiah, Who would deliver His own
from the worshippers of false gods, should be brought up with the latter
in the land.

Verse 13 is quoted in the Talmud (Rosh. haSh. 11 b) in connection with
the future deliverance. So also in Yalkut, i. p. 217 d, and Pirqe de R.
EL. c. 31.

Is. xxviii. 16 the Targum apparently applied in Sanh 97 b; verse 15 Jer.
Taan. i. 1.

The expression in Is. xxx. 19, ‘he shall be very gracious unto thee,’ is
applied to the merits of the Messiah in Yalkut on Zeph. iii. 8 (p. 84
c).

On verse 25 see our remarks on Gen. xviii. 4.

Verse 26 is applied to Messianic times in the Talmud (Pes. 68 a, and
Sanh. 91 b), and similarly in Purqe de R. EL 51, and Shemoth R. 50. So
also in Ber. R. 12. see our remarkes on Gen. ii. 4.

Is. xxxii. 14, 15. On this passage the Midrash of Lam. iii. 49
significantly remarks that it is one of the three passage in which
mention of the Holy Ghost follows upon mention redemption, the other two
passages being Is. 22, followed by lxi. 1, and Lam. iii. 49.

Is. xxxii. 20. Te first clause is explained by Tanchuma (Par. 1. ed.
Warsh. p. 4 a, first three lines) to apply to the study of the Law, and
the second to the two Messiahs, the son of Josehp being likened to the
ox, and the son of David tothe ass, accordingly to Zech. ix. p; and
similary the verse is Messianically referred to in Deb. R. 6 (ed. Warsh.
Vol. iii. p. 15 b), in a very curious play on the words in Deut. xxii.
6, 7, where the observance of that commandment is supposed to hastenthe
coming of King Messiah.

Is. xxxv. 1. This is one of the passages quoted in Tanchuma on Deut. i.
1. (ed.Warsh. p. 99 a) as among the mircles which God would do to
redeemed Zion in the latter days. So also is verse 2 in this chapter.

Is. xxxv. 5, 6 is repeatedly applied to Messianic times. Tus, in Yalkut
i. 78 c, and 157 a; in Ber. R. 95; and in Midrash on Ps. cxlvi. 8.

Verse 10 is equally applied to Messianic times in the Midreah on Ps.
civii. 1, while at the same time it is notedd that this deliverance will
be accomplished by God Himself, and not either by Elijah, nor by the
King Messiah. [1 Signor Castelli remarks in his learned treatise (Il
Messia, p. 164) that redemption is always ascribe to God, and not to the
Messiah. But the distinction is of no importance, seeing that this is
indeed the work of God, but carried out by the Messiah, while, on the
other hand, Rabbinic writings frequency of the Messiah.] A similar
reference occurs in Yalkut (vol. ii. p. 162 d), at the close of the
Commentary on the Book of Chronicles, where it is remarked that in this
world the deliverance of Israelwas accomplished by man, and was followed
by fresh captivities, but in the latter orMessianic days their
deliverance would be accomplished by God, and would no more be followed
by captivity. See also Shemoth R. 15 and 23.

Is. xl. 1 is one of the passages referred to in our note on Is. xi. 12,
and also on Is. xxxv. 1.

The same remark applies to verse 2 and 3.

Verse 5 is also Messianically applied in Vayyikra R. 1; Yalk. ii. 77 b
about the middle.

On verse 10 Yalkut, in discussing Ex. xxxii. 6 (vol. i. p. 108 c)
broaches the opinion, that in the days of the Messiah Israel would have
a bouble reward, on account of the calamities which they had suffered,
quoting Is. xl. 10.

Is. xl. 18 has been already noted in our remarks on Gen. xviii. 4, 5.

Verse 25 is Messianically applied in Bem, R. 13, p. 48 b.

The expression ‘The first,’ in ch. xli. 27, is generally applied to the
Messiah; in the Targum, according to Rashi; in Bereshith R. 63; in
Vayyikra R. 30; and in the Talmud (Pes. 5 a); so also in Pesiqta (ed.
Buber) p. 185 b.

Is. xlii. 1 is applied in the Targum to the Messiah, as also in the
Midrash or Ps. ii.; and in Yalkut ii. p. 104 d. See also our comments on
Ps. ii. 7.

On is. xliii. 10, the Targum renders ‘My servant’ by ‘My servant the
Messiah.’

The promise in is. xlv. 22 is also among the future things mentioned in
the midrash on lamentations, to which we have referred in our remarks on
Is. xi. 12.

Is. xlix. 8. There is a remarkable comment on this in Yalkut on the
passage, to the effect that the Messiah suffers in every age for the
sins of that generation, but that God would in the day of redemption
repair it all (Yalk. ii. p. 52 b). Is. xlix. 9 is quoted as the words of
the messiah in Yalkut (vol. ii. p. 52 b).

Verse 10 is one of the passages referred to in the Midrash on
Lamentations, quoted in connection with Is. xi. 12.

Verse 12 has already been noticed in our remarked on Ex. xii. 2.

From the expression ‘comfort’ in verse 13, the Messianic title
‘Menachem’ is derived. Comp. the Midrash on Prov. xix. 21.

Verse 14 is Messianically applied in Yalkut ii. p. 52 c.

Verse 21 is also one of the passages referred to in the Midrash of
Lamentations, quoted under Ps. xi. 12.

On verse 23 it is remarked in Vayyikra R. 27 (ed. Warsh. p. 42 a), that
Messianic blessings were generally prefigured by similay events, as for
example,the passage here quoted in the case of Nebuchadnezzar and
Daniel.

A Messianic application of the same passsage also occurs in Par. 33 and
36, as a contrast to the contempt that Israel experiences in this world.

The second clause of verse 23 is applied to the Messiah in the Midrash
on Ps. ii. 2, as to be fulfilled when the Gentiles shall see the
terrible judgements.

Verse 26 is similarly applied to the destruction of the Gentiles in
Vayyikra R.33 (end).

Is. li, 12 is one of the passages referred to in the Midrash of
Lamentations, quoted in our comments in Is. xi. 12.

Is. li. 12 and 17 are among the passages referred to in our remarks on
Is. xxv.9

Is. lii. 3 is Messianically applied in the Talmud (Sanh. 97 b), while
the last clause of verse 2 is one of the passages quoted in the Midrash
on Lamentations (see Is. xi. 12).

The well-known Evangelic declaration in ls. lii. 7 is thus commented
upon in Yalkut (vol. ii. p. 53 c): In the hour when the Holy One,
blessed be His Name, redeems Israel, three days before Messiah comes
Elijah, and stands upon the mountains of Israel, and weeps and mourns
for them, and says to them: Behold the land of Israel, how long shall
you stand in a dry and desolate land? And hisvoice is heard from the
world’s end to the world’s end, and after that it is said to them: Peace
has come to the world, peace has come to the world, as it is said: How
beautiful upon the mountains, &c. And when the wicked hear it, they
rejoice,and they say one to the other: Peace has come to us. On the
second day he shall stand upon the mountains of Israel, and shall say:
Good has come to theworld, good has come to the world, as it is written:
That bringeth good tidings of good. On the third day he shall come and
stand upon the mountains of Israel, and say: Salvation has come to the
world, salvation has come to the world, as itis written: That publisheth
salvation.

Similarly, this passage is quoted in Yalkut on Ps. cxxi. 1. See also our
remarks on Cant. ii. 13.

Verse 8 is one of the passages referred to in the Midrash on
Lamentations quoted above, and frequently in other places as Messianic.

Verse 12 is Messianically applied in Shemoth R. 15 and 19.

Verse 13 is applied in the Targum expressly to the Messiah. On the words
‘He shall be exalted and extolled’ we read in Yalkut ii. (Par. 338, p.
53 c, lines 7 &c. from the bottom): He shall be higher than Abraham, to
whom applies Gen. xiv. 22; higher than Moses, of whom Num. xi. 12 is
predicated; higher than the ministering angels, of whom Ezek. i. 18 is
said. But to Him there applies this in Zech. iv. 7: ‘Who art thou, O
great mountain?’ ‘And He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised
for our iniquities, and the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and
with His stripes we are healed.’ R. Huma says, in the name of R. Acha:
All sufferings are divided into three parts; one part goes to David
andthe Patriarchs, another to the generation of the rebellion
(rebellious Israel), and the third to the King Messiah, as it is written
(Ps. ii. 7), ‘Yet have I set My King upon My holy hill of Zion.’ Then
follows a curious quotation from the Midrash onSamuel, in which the
Messiah indicates that His dwelling is on Mount Zion, and that guilt is
connected with the destruction of its walls.

In regard to Is. liii. we remember, that the Messianic name of ‘Leprous’
(Sanh. 98 b) is expressly based upon it. Is. liii. 10 is applied in the
Targum on the passage to the Kingdom of the Messiah.

Verse 5 is Messianically interpreted in the Midrash on Samuel (ed.
Lemberg, p. 45 a, last line), where it is said that all sufferings are
divided into three parts, one of which the Messiah bore, a remark which
is brought into connection with Ruth ii. 14. (See our comments on that
passage.)

Is. liv. 2 is expected to be fulfulled in Messianic times (Vayyikra R.
10).

Is. liv. 5. In Shemoth R. 15 this is expressly applied to Messianic
days.

Is. liv. 11 is repeatedly applied to the Messianic glory, as, for
example, in Shemoth R. 15. (See our comments on Ex. xii. 2.)

So is verse 13, as in Yalkut (vol. i. 78 c); in the Midrash on Ps. xxi.
1; and in other passages.

Is. lv. 12 is referred to Messianic times, as in the Midrash on Ps.
xiii.

Is. lvi. 1. See our comments on Exod. xxi. 1.

Verse 7 is one of the passages in the Midrash on Lamentations which we
have quoted under Is. xi. 12.

On Is. lvii. 14 Bemidhar R. 15 (ed. Warsh. p. 64 a) expresses a curious
idea about the stumbling-block, as mystically the evil inclination, and
adds that thepromise applies to God’s removal of it in the world to
come, or else it may be in Messianic days.

Verse 16 receives in the Talmud (Yeb. 62 a and 63 b) and in the Midr. on
Exxl. i. 6 the following curious comment: ‘The Son of David shall not
come till all the souls are completed which are in the Guph’, (i.e. the
pre-existence of souls is taught, and that they are kept in heaven till
one after another appears in human form, and that the Messiah is kept
back till all these shall have appeared), proof of this being derived
from Is. lvii. 16.

Similarly chap. lix. 15 is applied to Messianic times in Sanh. 97 a, and
Midr. on Cant. ii. 13; and verse 19 in Sanh. 98 a.

Verse 17 is applied to Messianic times in Pesiqta, ed. Buber, p. 149 a.

Verse 20 is one of the passages mentioned in the Midrash on Lamentations
quoted above. (See Is. xi. 12.)

Is. lix. 19, 20, is applied to Messianic times in Sanh. 98 a. In Pesiqta
166 b it is similarly applied, the peculiar form (plene) in which the
word Goel (Redeemer) is written being taken to indicate the Messiah as
the Redeemer in the full sense.

Is. lx. 1. This is applied in the Targum to Messianic times. Similarly,
it is explained in Ber. R. i. with reference to Dan. ii. 2; in Ber. R.
2; and also in Bemidbar R. 15 and 21. In Yalkut we have some very
interesting remarks on the subject. Thus (vol. i. Par. 363, p. 99 c),
commenting on Exod xxv. 3 &c., in a very curious description of how God
would in the world to come return to Israel the various things which
they had offered for the Tabernacle, the oil is brought into connection
with the Messiah, with reference to Ps. cxxxii. 17 and Is. lx. 1. Again,
on p. 215 c (at the commencement of the Parashah Behaalothekha) we have,
first, a very curious comparison between the work of the Tabernacle and
that of the six days of Creation, after which the question is put: Why
Moses made seven lights, and Solomon seventy? To this the reply is
given, that Moses rooted up seven nations before Israel, while Solomon
reigned over all the seventy nations which, according to Jewish ideas,
constitute the world. Upon this it is added, that God had promised, that
as Israel had lighted for His glory the lights in theSanctuary, so would
He in the latter days fill Jerusalem with His glory, according to the
promise in Is. lx. 1, and also set up in the midst of it lights,
according to Zeph. i. 12. Still more clearly is the Messianic
interpretation of Is. lx. brought out in the comments in Yalkut on that
chapter. One part of it is so curious that it may here find a place.
After explaining that this light for which Israel is looking is the
light of the Messiah, and that Gen. i. 4 really referred to it, it is
added that this is intended to teach us that God looked forward to the
age of the Messiah and His works before the Creation of the world, and
that He hid that light for the Messiah and His generation under His
throne of glory. On Satan’s questioning Him for whom that light was
destined, the answer is: For Him Who in the latter days will conquer
thee, and cover thy face with shame. On which Satan requests to see Him,
and when he is shown Him, falls on his face and says: I confess that
this is the Messiah Who will in the latter days be able to cast me, and
all the Gentiles, into Gehenna, according to Is. xxv. 8. In that hour
all the nations will tremble, and say befire God: Who is this into Whose
hand we fall, what is His Name, and what is His purpose? On which God
replies: This is Ephraim, the Messiah [the second Messiah, the son of
Joseph]; My Righteousness is His Name.‘And so the commentation goes on
to touch on Ps. lxxxix. 23, 24, and 26, in a manner most deeply
interesting, but which it would be impossible here fully to give
(Yalkut, vol. ii. Par. 359, p. 56 c). In col. d there are farther
remarkable discussions about the Messiah, in connection with the wars in
the days when Messiah should be revealed, and about Israel’s final
safety. But the most remarkable passage of all, reminding us almost of
the history of the Temptation, is that which reads as follows (line 22
&c. from the top): It is a tradition from our Rabbis that, in the hour
when King Messiah comes, He stands on the roof of the Temple, and
proclaims to them, that the hour of their deliverance has come, and that
if they believed they would rejoice in the light that had risen upon
them, as it is written (Is. lx. 1), ’Arise, shine, for thy light is
come.’ This light would be for them alone, as it is written (ver. 2),
‘For darkness shall cover the earth.’ In that hour also would God
takethe light of the Messiah and of Israel, and all should walk in the
light of Messiah and of Israel, as it is written (ver. 3), ’The Gentiles
shall come to thy light,and kings to the brightness of thy rising. And
the kings of the nations should lick the dust from under the feet of the
Messiah, and should all fall on their faces before Him and before
Israel, and say: Let us be servants to Thee and to Israel. And so the
passage goes on to describe the glory of the latter days. Indeed, the
whole of this chapter may be said to be full of Messianic
interpretations.

After this it will scarecely be necessary to say that verses 2, 3, and 4
are similarly applied in the Midrashim. But it is interesting to notice
that verse 2is specifically applied to Messianic times in the Talmud
(Sanh. 99 a), in answer tothe question when the Messiah should come.

On verse 4 the Midrash on Cant. i. 4, on the words ‘we will be gad and
rejoice in thee,’ has the following beautiful illustration. A Queen is
introduced whose husband and sons and sons-in-law go to a distant
country. Tidings are brought to her: Thy sons are come back. On which
she says: Cause for gladness have I, my daughters-in-law will rejoice.
Next, tidings are brought her that her sons-in-law are coming, and she
is glad that her daughters will rejoice. Lastly,tidings are brought: The
king, thy husband, comes. On which she replies: This is indeed perfect
joy, joy unpon joy. So in the latter days would the prophets come, and
say to Jerusalem: ‘Thy sons shall come from far’ (verse 4), and she will
say: What gladness is this to me!, ‘and thy daughters shall be nursed at
thy side,’ and again she will say: What gladness is this to me! But when
they shall say to her (Zech. ix. 9): ‘Behold, thy king cometh unto thee;
he is just, and having salvation,’ then shall Zion say: This indeed is
perfect joy, as it is written (Zech. ix. 9), ‘Rejoice greatly, O
daughter of Zion,’ and again (Zech. ii. 10), ‘Sing and rejoice, O
daughter of Zion.’ In that hour she will say (Is. lxi. 10): ‘I will
greatly rejoice in the Lord, my sould shall be joyful in my God.’

Verse 7 is messianically applied in the Talmud (Abod. Sar. 24 a).

Verse 8 is Messianically applied in the Midrash on Ps. xlvii. 13.

In connection with verse 19 we read in Yalkut (vol. i. p. 103 b) that
God said to Israel: In this world you are engaged (or busied) with the
light for the Sanctuary, but in the world to come, for the merit of this
light, I send you theKing Messiah, Who is likened to a light, according
to Ps. cxxxii. 17 and Is. lx. 19, ‘the Lord shall be unto thee an
everlasting light.’

Verse 21 is thus alluded to in the Talmud (Sanh. 98 a): ‘Rabbi Jochanan
said, The Son of David shall not come, until all be either just or all
be unjust:’ the former according to Is. lx. 21, the latter according to
Is. lix. 16.

Verse 22 is also Messianically applied in the Talmudic passage above
cited.

Is. lxi. 1 has already been mentioned in our remarks on Is. xxxii. 14,
15.

On verse 5 there is a curious story related (Yalkut, vol. i. Par. 212,
p. 64 a,lines 23-17 from the bottom) in which, in answer to a question,
what was to become of the nations in the days of the Messiah, the reply
is given that every nation and kingdom that had persecuted and mocked
Israel would see, and be confounded, and have no share in life; but that
every nation and kingdom which had not so dealt with israel would come
and be husbandmen and vinedressers to Israel in thedays of the Messiah.
A similar statement to this is found in the Midrash on Eccl. ii. 7.

Verse 9 is also applied to Messianic times.

Verse 10 is one of the passages referred to in Tanchuma on Deut. i. 1
quoted under Is. xxv. 9. In Pesiqta, ed. Buber, p. 149 a, the verse is
explained as applying to the glory of Messiah’s appearance.

Is. lxii. 10 has already been referred to in our remarks on Is. lvii.
14.

Is. lxiii. is applied to the Messiah, Who comes to the land after having
seen the destruction of the Gentiles, in Pirqe de R. Eliez. c. 30.

Verse 2 has been referred to in our comments on Cant. v. 10. It is also
quoted in reference to Messianic days in Pesiqta, ed. Buber, p. 149 a.

Verse 4 is explained as pointing to the days of the Messiah, which are
supposed to be 365 years, according to the number of the solar days
(Sanh. 99 a); while in other passages of the Midrashim, the destruction
of Rome and the coming of the Messiah are conjoined with the day of
vengeance. See also the Midr. on Eccl. xii. 10.

Is. lxiv. 4 (3 in the Hebrew). In Yalkut on Is. lx. (vol. ii. p. 56 d,
line 6, &c., from the bottom) Messianic application is made of this
passage in alegendary account of the seven tabernacles which God would
make for the Messiah, out of each of which proceed four streams of wine,
milk, honey, and pure balsam. Then God is represented as speaking of the
sufferings which Messiah was to undergo, after which the verse in
question is quoted.

Is. lxv. 17 is quouted in the Midrash on Lamentations, referred to in
our remarks on Is. xi. 12.

Verse 19 is one of the passages referred to in Tanchuma on Deut. i. 1.
See Isaiah xxv. 9. To verse 25 we have the following curious
illustrative reference in Ber. R. 20 (ed. Warsh. p. 38 b, line 6 from
the bottom) in connection with the Fall: In the latter days everything
shall be healed again (restored again) except the serpent (Is. lxv. 25)
and the Gibeonites (Ezek. xlviii. 19). But a still more strange
application of the verse occurs in the same Midrash (Par. 95, ed. Warsh.
p. 170 a), where the opening clauses of it are quoted with this remark:
Come and see all that the Holy One, blessed be His Name, has smitten in
this world, He will heal in the latter days. Upon which a curious
disquisition follows, to prove that every man would appear after death
exaclty as he had been in life, whether blind, dumb, or halting, nay,
even in the same dress, as in the case of Samuel when Saul saw him, but
that afterwards God would heal the diseased.

Is lxvi. 7 is applied to Messianic times in Vayyikra R. 14 (last line),
and so are some of the following verses in the Midrashim, notably on
Gen. xxxiii. 1.

Is. lxviii, 22 is applied to Messianic times in Ber. R. 12. See our
remarks on Gen. ii. 4.

Jer. iii. 17 is applied to Messianic days in Yalkut on Joshua iii. 9 &c.
(vol. ii. p. 3c, line 17 from the top),and so is verse 18 in the
commentation on the wordsin Cant. i. 16 ‘our bed is green,’ the
expression being understood of the ten tribes, who had been led captive
beyond the river Sabbayon; but when Judah’s deliverancecame, Judah and
Benjamin would go to them and bring them back, that they might be
worthly of the days of the Messiah (vol. ii. p., 176d, line 9 &c. from
the bottom).

Jer. v. 19 is mentioned in the Introd. to Echa R. as one of three
passages by which to infer from the apostasy of Israel the near advent
of Messiah.

The expression ‘speckled bird’ in Jer. xii. 9 is applied to the Messiah
in Pirqe de R. Eliez. c. 28.

The last word in Jer. xvi. 13 is made the basis of the name Chaninah,
given to the Messiah in the Talmud (Sanh. 98 b), and in the Midr. on
Lam. i. 16.

On verse 14 Mechilta hasit, that in the latter days the Exodus would no
more be mentioned on account of the greater wonders then experienced.

On Jer. xxiii. 5, 6, the Targum has it: ‘And I will raise up for David
the Messiah the Just.’ This is one of the passages from which according
to Rabbinic views, one of the Names of the Messiah is derived, vix:
Jehovah our Righteousness. So in the Talmud (Babba Bathra 75 b), in the
Midrash on Ps. xxi. 1, Prov. xix. 21, and in the on Lamentations i. 16.
On verse 7 see our remarks on Jer. xvi 14. In the Talmud (Ber. 12 b)
this verse is distinctly applied to Messianic days. Jer. xxx. 9 is
Messianically applied in the Targum on the passage.

Jer. xxx. 21 is applied to the Messiah in the Targum, and also in the
Midrash on Ps. xxi. 7.

On Jer. xxxi. 8, 3rd clause, Yalkut has a Messianic interpretation,
although extremely far-fetched. In general, the following verses are
Messianically interpreted in the Midrashim.

Verse 20 is Messianically applied in Yalkut (ii. p. 66 c, end), where it
is supposed to reefer to the Messiah when imprisoned, when all the
nations mock and shake their heads at Him. A more remarkable
interpretation still occurs in the passageon Is. 1x. 1, to which we have
already referred. Some farther extracts from it may be interesting.
Thus, when the enemies of the Messiah flee before Him. God is supposed
to make an agreement with the Messiah to this effect: The sins of those
who are hidden with Thee will cause Thee to be put under an iron yoke,
andthey will do with Thee as with this calf, whose eyes are covered, and
they will choke Thy spirit under the yoke, and on account of their sins
They tongue shall cleaveto Thy mouth. On which the Messiah inquires
whether these troubles are to last for many years, and the Holy replies
that He has decreed a week, but that if His soul were in sorrow, He
would immediately dispel these sorrows. On this the Messiah says: Lord
of the world, with gladness and joy of heart I take it upon Me, on
condition that not one of Israel should perish, and hat not only those
alone should be saved who are in My days, but also those who are hid in
the dust; and that not only the dead should be saved who are in My days,
but also those who have died from the days of the first Adam till now;
and not those, but also those who have been prematurely born. And only
these, but also those who have come into Thy knowledge to create them,
but have not yet been created. Thus I agree, and thus I take all upon
Me. In the hebdomad when the Son of David comes, they shall bring beans
of iron, and shall make them a yoke to His neck, until His stature is
bent down. But He cries and weeps, and lifts up His voice on high, and
says before Him: Lord of the world, what is My strength, My spirit, and
My soul, and My members? Am I not flesh and blood? In that honor David
(the Son of David) weeps, and says: ‘My strength is dried up like a
potsherd.’ In that hour the Holy One, blessed be His Name, says: Ephraim
the Messiah, My righteous one, Thou hast already taken this upon Thee
before the six days of theworld, now Thy anguish shall be like My
anguish; for from the time that Nebuchadnezzar, the wicked one, has come
up and destroyed My house, and burned My Sancturary, and I have sent
into captivity My children among the children of theGentiles, by My
life, and by the life of Thy head, I have not sat down on My throne. And
if Thou wilt not believe Me, see the dew which is on My head, as it is
said (Cant. v. 2) ‘My head is filled with dew.’ In that hour the messiah
answers Him: Lord of the world, now I am quieted, for it is enough for
the servant that he is as his Master (his reminding us of our Lord’s
saying, St. Matt. x. 25 ). R. Isaac then remarks that in the year when
the King Messiah shall be revealed, all nations shall rise up against
each other (we have already quoted this passage in another place, as
also that about the Messiah standing upon the roof of the Temple). Then
follows this as a tradition of the Rabbis: In the latter days the
Fathers shall stand up in the month of Nisan, and say to Him: Ephraim,
the Messiah, our Righteousness, though we are Thy Fathers, yet Thou art
better than we, because Thou hast borne all the sins of our sons, and
hard and evil measure has passed upon Thee, such as has not been passed
either upon those before or upon those after. And Thou hast been for
laughter and derision to the nations for the sake of Israel, and Thou
hast dwelt in darkness and in mist, andThine eyes have not seen light,
and Thy light clung to Thee alone, and Thy body was dried up like wood,
and Thine eyes were darkened through fasting, and Thy strength was dried
up like a postsherd. And all this on account of the sins of our
children. Is it Thy pleasure that our sons should enjoy the good thing
which Godhad displayed to Israel? Or perhaps on account of the anguish
which Thou hast suffered for them, because they have bound Thee in the
prison-house, wilt Thou not give unto them thereof? He says to them:
Fathers of the world, whatever I have done I have done for your sakes,
and for the sake of your children, that they may enjoy that goodness
which the Holy One, blessed be He, has displayed to Israel. Then say to
Him the Fathers of the world: Ephraim, Messiah, our Righteousness, be
Thou reconciled to us, because Thou hast reconciled They Maker and us.
R. Simeon, the son of Pasi, In that hour the Holy One, blessed be His
Name, exalts the Messiah to the heaven of heavens, and spreads over Him
the splendour of His glory, because of the nations of the world, and
becauseof the wicked Persians. Then the Fathers of the worldsay to Him:
Ephraim, Messiah, our Righteousness, be Thou their judge, and do to them
what Thy soul desireth. For unless mercies had been multipled on Thee,
they would long ago have exterminated Theee suddenly from the world, as
it is written (Jer. xxxi. 20) ‘Is Ephraim my dear son?’ And why is the
expression: ‘I will surely have mercy’ [in the Hebrew reduplicated:
‘having mercy I will have mercy’], but that the first expression ‘mercy’
refers to the hour when He was bound in prison, when day by day they
gnashed with their teeth, and winked with their eyes, and nodded with
their heads, and wide-opened their mouths, as it is written in Ps. xxii.
7 [8 in Hebrew]; while the second expression ‘I willhave mercy’ refers
to the hour when He came out of the prison-house, when not only one
kingdom, not two, came against Him, but 140 kingdoms came round about
Him, and the Holy One, blessed be His Name, says to Him: Ephraim,
Messiah, My righteous one, be not afraid, for all these shall perish by
the breath of Thy mouth, as it is written (Is. xi. 4). Long as this
quotation may be, its interest seems sufficient to warrant its
insertion.

Jer. xxxi. 31, 33, and 34 are applied to Messianic times in Yalkut (vol.
i. p. 196c; 78c; and in vol. ii. p. 54 b, and p. 66 d).

Jer. xxxiii. 13. The close of the verse is thus paraphrased in the
Targum: ‘Thepeople shall yet learn by the hands of the Messiah,’ while
in Yalkut (vol. i. p.105 d) mention is made of a tenfold gathering of
Israel, the last, in connection with this verse, in the latter days.

On Lam. i. 16 there is in the Midrash R. (ed. Warsh. p. 64 b) the
curious storyabout the birth of the Messiah in the royal palace of
Bethlehem, which also occurs in the Jer. Talmud.

Lam. ii. 22, first clause. The Targum here remarks: Thou wilt proclaim
liberty to Thy people, the house of Israel, by th hand of the Messiah.

Lam. iv. 22, first clause. The Targum here remarks: And afteer these
things thy iniquity shall cease, and thou shalt be set free by the hands
of the Messiahand by the hands of Elijah the Priest

Ezek xi. 19 is applied to the great spiritual change that was to take
place in Messianic days, when the evil desire would be taken out of the
heart (Deb. R. 6,at the end; and also in other Midrashic passages).

Ezek. xvi. 55 is referred to among the ten things which God would renew
in Messianic days, the rebuilding of ruined cities, inclusive of Sodom
and Gomorrah, being the fourth (Shem. R. 15, ed. Warsh. p. 24 b).

Ezek xvii. 22 and 23 is distinctly and very beautifully referred to the
Messiahin the Targum.

Ezek. xxv. 14 is applied to the destruction of all the nations by Israel
in thedays of the Messiah in Bemidbar R. on Num. ii. 32 (Par. 2, ed.
Warsh. p. 5 b).

Ezek. xxix. 21 is among the passages applied to the time when the
Messiah should come, in Sanh. 98 a.

So is Ezek. xxxii. 14.

Ezek xxxvi. 25 is applied to Messianic times alike in the Targum and in
Yalkut (vol. i. p. 235 a), as our in the Talmud (Kidd. 72 b).

On verse 27 see our remarks on chap. xi. 19. Ezek. xxxix. 2 is
Messianically applied in Bemidbar R. 13, Warsh. p. 48 b.

Ezek. xlvii. 9 and 12 are quoted as the second and the third things
which God would renew in the latter days (Shem. R. 15), the second
being, that living waters should go forth out of Jerusalem, and the
third, that trees should bear fruit every month, and the sick be healed
by them.

On Ezek. xlviii. 19 the Talmud (Baba B. 122a) has the following curious
comment, that the land of Israel would be divided into thirteenth
tribes, the thirteenth belonging to the Prince, and this verse is quoted
as proof.

Dan ii. 22 is Messianically applied in Ber. R. 1, and in the Midr. on
Lament. i. 16, where it gives rise to another name of the Messiah: the
Lightgiver.

Verse 35 is similarly applied in the Pirqe de R. Eliez. c. 11, and verse
44 in c. 30.

Dan. vii. p. This passage was interpreted by R. Akiba as implying that
one throne was set for God, and the other for the Messiah (Chag. 14 a).

Dan, vii. 13 is curiously explained in the TAlmud (Sanh. 98 a), where it
is said that, if Israel behaved worthily, the Messiah would come in the
clouds of heaven; if otherwise, humble, and riding upon an ass.

Dan. vii. 27 is applied to Messianictimes in Bem. R. 11. Dan. viii. 13,
14. By a very curious combination these verses are brought into
connection with Gen. iii. 22 (’man has become like one of us’), and it
is argued, that in Messianic days man’s primeval innocence and glory
would be restored to him, and he become like one of the heavenly beings,
Ber. R. 21 (ed. Warsh. p. 41 a).

Dan. ix. 24. In Naz. 32 b it is noted as that referred to the time when
the second Temple was to be destroyed. So also in Yalkut, vol. ii. p. 79
d, lines 16&c. from the bottom.

Dan. xii. 3 is applied to Messianic times in a beautiful passage in
Shem. R. 15(at the end).

Dan. xii. 11, 12. These two verses receive a peculiar Messianic
interpretation,and that by the authority of the Rabbis. For it is argued
that, as Moses, the first Redeemer, appeared, and was withdrawn for a
time, and then reappeared, so would the second Redeemer; and the
interval between His disappearance and reappearanceis calculated at 45
days, arrived at by deducting the 1,290 days of the cessation of the
sacrifice (Dan. xii. 11) from the 1,335 days of Dan. xii. 12 (Midr. on
Ruth ii. 14, ed. Warsh. p. 43 b). Hos. ii. 2 is explained in the Midr.
on Ps. xlv. 1 as imply that Israel’s redemption would be when they were
at the lowest.

Hos. ii. 13 is one of the three passages referred to on Jer. v. 19.

Hos. ii. 18 is quoted in Shem. R. 15 (on Ex. xii. 2) as the seventh of
the ten things which God would make new in Messianic days.

Hos. iii. 5 is applied to the Messiah in the Targum, and from it the
Jer. Talm.(Ber. 5 a) derives the name David as one of those given to the
Messiah.

Hos. vi. 2 is Messianically applied in the Targum.

Hos. xiii. 14 is applied to the deliverance by the Messiah of those of
Israel who are in Gehinnom, whom He sets free;, the term Zion being
understood of Paradise.See Yalk. on Is. Par. 269, comp. Maas. de R.
Joshua in Jellinek’s Beth ha-Midr. ii. p. 50.

Hos xiv. 7 is Messianically applied in the Targum.

Joel ii. 28 is explained in the Midrashim as referring to the latter
days, whenall Israel will be prophets (Bemidbar R. 15; Yalkut i. p. 220
c, and other places).

Joel iii. 18 is similarly applied in the Midrashim, as in that on Ps.
xiii. andin others. The last clause of this verse is explained in the
Midr. on Eccl. i. 9to imply that the Messiah would cause a fountain
miraculously to spring up, as Moses did in the wilderness.

Amos iv 7 is in Midr. on Cant. ii. 13 applied to the first of the seven
years before Messiah come.

Amos v. 18 is one of the passages adduced in the Talmud (Sanh. 98 b) to
explain why certain Rabbis didnot wish to see the day of the Messiah.

Amos viii. 11 is applied to Messianic times in Ber. R. 25.

Amos ix. 11 is a notable Messianic passage. Thus, in the Talmud (Sanh.
96 b) where the Messiah is called the ‘Son of the Fallen,’ the name is
explained by a reference to this passage. Again, in Ber. R. 88, last
three lines (ed. Warsh. p. 157 a) after enumerating the unexpected
deliverances which Israel had formerly experienced, it is added: Who
could have expected that the fallen tabernacle of David should be raised
up by God, as it is written (Amos ix. 11) and who should have expected
that the whole world should become one bundle (be gathered into one
Church)? Yet it is written Zeph. iii. 9. Comp. also the long discussion
in Yalkut on this passage (vol. ii. p. 80 a and b).

Obadiah verses 18 and 21 are applied to the Kingdom and time of the
Messiah in Deb. R. 1.

Micah ii. 13. See our remarks on Gen. xviii. 4, 5. The passage is also
Messianically quoted in the Midrash on Prov. vi. (ed. Lemberg, p. 5 a,
first twolines).

The promis in Micah. iv. 3 is applied to the times of the Messiah in th
eTalmud(Shabb. 63 a).

So is the prediction in verse 5 in Shemoth R. 15; while cerse 8 is thus
commented upon in the Targum: ‘And thou Messiah of Israel, Who shalt be
hidden on account of the sins of Zion, to thee shall the Kingdom come.’

The well-know passage, Micah v. 2, is admittedly Messianic. So in the
Targum, in the Pirqe de R. Eliez. c. 3, and by later Rabbis.

Verse 3 is applied in the Talmud to the fact that the Messiah was not to
come till the hostile kingdom had spread for nine months over the whole
world (Yoma 10 a), or else, over the whole land of Israel (Sanh. 98 b).

Similarly Micah vii. 6 is applied to Messianic times in Sanh. 97 a, and
in Sotah 49 b; also in the Midr. on Cant. ii. 13. And so is verse 15 in
Yalkut (vol. ii. p. 112 b.

In Micah vii. 8, the expression, Jehovah shall be light to me, is
referred to the days of the Messiah in Deb. R. 11, ed. Warsh. vol. v. p.
22 a.

Nahum ii. 1. See our remarks on Is. lii. 7. Habakkuk ii. 3. This is
appl,ied to Messianic times in a remarkable passage in Sanh. 97 b, which
will be quoted in full at the close of this Appendix; also in Yalkut,
vol. ii. p. 83 b.

Habakkuk iii. 18 is applied to Messianic times in the Targum.

Zephanan iii. 8. The words rendered in our A.V. ‘the day that I rise up
to the prey’ are translated ‘for testimony’ and applied to God’s bearing
testimony for the Messiah (Yalkut, vol. ii. p. 84 c, line 6 from the
top).

Verse 9 is applied to the voluntary conversion of the Gentiles in the
days of the Messiah in the Talmud (Abhod. Zarah, 24 a); and in Ber. R.
88; and verse 11 in Sanh. 98 a. Haggai ii. 6 is expressly applied to the
coming redemption in Deb. R. 1 (ed. Warsh. p. 4 b, line 15 from the
top).

Zech. i. 20. The four carpenters there spoken of are variously
interpreted in the Talmud (Sukk. 52 b), and in the Midrash (Bemidbar R.
14). But both agree that one of them refers to the Messiah.

Zech. ii. 10 is one of the Messianic passages to which we have referred
in our remarks on Is. lx. 4. It has also a Messianic cast in the Targum.

Zech. iii. 8. The designation ‘Bracnch’ is expressly applied to King
Messiah inthe Targum. Indeed, this is one of the Messiah’s peculiar
names.

Verse 10 is quoted in the Midrash on Ps. lxxii. (ed. Warsh. p. 56 a, at
the top) in a description of the future time of universal peace.

Zech. iv. 7 is generally applied to the Messiah, expressly in the
Targum, and also in several of the Midrashim. Thus, as regards both
clauses of it, in Tanchuma (Par. Toledoth 14, ed. Warsh. p. 37 b and 38
a).

Verse 10 is Messianically explained in Tanchuma (u. s.).

Zech. vi. 12 is universally admitted to be Messianic. So in the Targum,
the Jerusalem Talmud (Ber. 5 a), in the Pirqe de R. Eliez. c. 48, and in
the Midrashim.

Zech. vii. 13 us one of the three passages supposed to mark the near
advent of Messiah. See our remarks on Jer. v. 19.

Zech. viii. 12 is applied to Messianic times in Ber. R. 12. See our
remarks on Gen. ii. 4.

Zech. viii. 23 is one of the predictions expected to be fulfilled in
Messianic days, it being however noted that it refers to instruction in
the Law in that remarkable passage on Is. lx. 1 in Yalkut ii. p. 56 d,
to which we have already referred.

In Zech. ix. 1 the name ‘Chadrakh’ is mystically separated into ‘Chad,’
sharp, and ‘rakh,’ gentle, the Messiah being the one to the Gentiles and
the other to the Jews (Siphre on Deut. p. 65 a, Yalkut i. p. 258 b).

Verse 9. The Messianic application of this verse in all its parts has
already repeatedly been indicated. We may here add that there are many
traditions about this ass on which the Messiah is to ride; and so firm
was the belief in it, that, according to the Talmud, ‘if anyone saw an
ass in his dreams, he will see salvation’ (Ber. 56 b). The verse is also
Messianically quoted in Sanh. 98 a, in Pirqe de R. Eliez. c. 31, and in
several of the Midrashim.

On verse 10 see our remarks on Deut. xx. 10.

Zech. x. 4 is Messianically applied in the Targum.

Zech. xi. 12 is Messianically explained in Ber. R. 98, but with this
remark, that the 30 pieces of silver apply to 30 percepts, which the
Messiah is to give to Israel.

Zech. xii. 10 is applied to the Messiah the Son of Joseph in the Talmud
(Sukk. 52 a), and so is verse 12, there being, however, a difference of
opinion whetherthe mouring is caused by the death of the Messiah the Son
of Joseph, or else on account of the evil concupiscens (Yetser haRa).

Zech. xiv. 2 will be readily understood to have been applied to the wars
of Messianic times, and tis in many passages of the Midrashim, as,
indeed, are verses 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Verse 7. The following interesting remark occurs in Yalkut on Ps.
cxxxix. 16, 17 (vol. ii. p. 129 d) on the words ‘none of them.’ \_his
world is to last 6,000 years; 2,000 years it was waste and desolate,
2,000 years mark the period under the Law, 2,000 years that under the
Messiah. And because our sins are increased,they are prolonged. As they
are prolonged, and as we make one year in seven a Sabbatic year, so will
God in the latter days make one day a Sabbatic year, ehich day is 1,000
years, to which applies the verse in Zechariah just quoted. See also
Pirqe de R. Eliez. c. 28.

Verse 8 is Messianically applied in Ber. R. 48. See our remarks on Gen.
xviii 4, 5.

Verse 9 is, of course, applied to Messianic times, as in Yulkut i. p. 76
c, 266a, and vol. ii. p. 33 c, Midr. on Cant. ii. 13, and in other
passages.

Malachi iii. 1 is applied to Elijah as forerunner of the Messiah in
Pirqe de R.Eliez. c. 29.

Verse 4. In Bemidbar R. 17, a little before the close (ed. Warsh. p. 69
a), this verse seems to be applied to acceptable sacrifices in Messianic
days. On verse 16 Vayyikra R. 34 (ed. Warsh. p. 51 b, line 4 from the
bottom) has thefollowing curious remark: If any one in former times did
the Commandment, the prophets wrote it down. But now when a man observes
the Commandment, who writes it down? Elijah and the King Messiah and the
Holy One, blessed be His Name, seal it at their hands, and a memorial
book is written, as it is written Mal. iii. 16.

The promise in verse 17 is extended to Messianic days in Shemoth R. 18.
On Mal. iv. 1 (in Hebrew iii. 19) the following curious comment occurs
in Bereshith R. 6 (p. 14 b, lines 15 &c. from the bottom): ‘The globe of
the sun isencased, as it is said, He maketh a tabernacle for the sun
(Ps. xix.). And a pool of water is before it. When the sun comes out,
God colls its heat in the water lestit should burn up the world. But in
the latter days the Holy One takes it out ofits sheath, and with it
burns up the wicked, as it is written Mal. iv. 1.’

Verse 2 (iii. 20 in Hebrew) is in Shemoth R. 31 quoted in connection
with Ex. xxii. 26, and explained ‘till the Messiah comes.’ G=erse 5 is,
of course, applied to the forerunner of the Messiah. So in many places,
as in the Pirqe de R. Eliez. c. 40; Debarm R. 3; in the Midrash on Cant.
i. 1; in the Talmud, and in Yalkut repeatedly. [1 From the abover review
of Old Testament passages, all reference to sacrifices has been omitted,
because, although the Synagogue held the doctrine of the vicariousness
and atoning character of these sacrifices, no mention occurs of the
Messiah in connection with them.]

To the above passages we add some from the Apocryphal Books, partly as
indication the views concerning the Messiah which the Jews had derived
from the Old Testament, and partly because of their agreement with
Jewish traditionalism as already expounded by us. These passages must
therefore be judged in connection with the Rabbinical ideas of the
Messiah and of Messianic days. it isin this sense that we read, for
example, the address to Jerusalem, Tobit xiii. 9 to the end. Comp. here,
for example, our quotations on Amos ix. 11.

Similarly Tobit xiv. 5-7 may be compared with our quotations on Ps. xc,
Is. lx. 3, and especially on Zech. viii. 23, also on Gen. xlix. 11.

Wisdom of Solomon iii. 7, 8 may be compared with our remarks on Is. lxi.
1.

Ecclus. xliv. 21 &c. and xlvi. 11 may be compared with our quotations on
Ps. lxxxix. 22-25; Ps. cxxxii. 18; Ezek. xxix. 21.

Ecclus. xlviii. 10, 11. See the comments on Is. lii. 7, also our
references on Mal. iii. 1; Mal. iv. 5; Deut. xxv. 19 and xxx. 4; Lam.
ii. 22. In Sotah ix. 15 Elijah is represented as raising the dead.

Baruch 11. 34, 35; iv 29 &c.; and ch. v. are so thoroughly in accordance
with Rabbinic, and, indeed, with Scriptual views, that it is almost
impossible to enumerate special references.

The same may be said of 1 Macc. ii. 57; while such passages as iv. 46
and xiv. 41 point forward to the ministry of Elijah as resolving doubts,
as this is frequently described in the Talmud (Shekalim ii. 5; Men. 45
a, Pes. 13 a; and inother places). Lastly, 2 Macc. ii. 18 is fully
enlarged on in the Rabbinic descriptions of the gathering of Israel.

Perhaps it may be as well here to add the Messianic discussion in the
Talmud, to which such frequent reference has been made (Sanhedrin,
beginning at the two last lines of p. 96 b, and ending at p. 99 a). The
first question is that asked by one Rabbi of the other, whether he knew
when the Son of the Fallen would come? Upon which follows an explanation
of that designation, based on Amos ix. 11, after which it is added that
it would be a generation in which the disciples of the sages would be
diminished, and the rest of men consume their eyes for sorrow, and
terrible sorrows so follow each other, that one had not ceased before
the other began. Then a description is given of what was to happen
during the hedbomad when the Son of David would come. In the first year
it would be according to Amos iv. 7; in the second year there would be
darts of famine; in the third year great famine and terrible mortality,
in consequence of which the Law would be forgotten by those who studied
it. In the fourth year there would be abundance, and yet no abundance;
in the fifth year great abundance and great joy, and return to thestudy
of the Law; in the sixth year voices (announcements); in the seventh
wars,and a the end of the seventh the Son of David would come. Then
follows some discussion about the order of the sixth and seventh year,
when Ps. lxxxix. 51 isreferred to. Next we have a description of the
general state during those days. Sacred places (Academies) would be used
for the vilest purposes, Galilee be desolated, Gablan laid waste, and
the men of Gebul wander from city to city, and not find mercy. And the
wisdom of the scribes would be corrupted, and they who fear sin be
abhorred, and the face of that generation would be like that of a dog,
and truth should fail, according toi Is. lix. 15. (Here a side issue is
raised.) The Talmud then continues in much the same terms to describe
the Messianic age as one, in which children would rebel against their
parents, and as one of general lawlessness, when Sadduceeism should
universally prevail, apostasy increase, study of the Lawdecrease; and,
generally, universal poverty and despair of redemption prevail, the
growing disregard of the Law being pointed out as specially
characterising the last days. R. Kattina said: The world is to last
6,000 years, and during one millennium it is to lie desolate, according
to Is. ii. 17. R. Abayi held that this state would last 2,000 years,
according to Hosea vi. 2. The opinion of R. Kattian was however,
regarded as supported by this, that in each period of seven there is a
Sabbatic year, the day here = 1,000 years of desolateness and rest, the
appeal world was to last 6,000 years: 2,000 in a state of chaos, 2,000
under the Law, and 2,000 being the Messianic age. But on account of
Israel’s sins those years were to be deducted which had already passed.
On the authority of Elijah it was stated that the world would not lass
less than eighty-five jubilees, and that inthe last jubilee the Son of
David would come. When Elijah was asked whether at the beginning or at
the end of it, he replied that he did not know. Being further asked
whether the whole of that period would first elapse or not, he similarly
replied, his meaning being supposed to be that until that term people
were not to hope for the Advent of Messiah, but after that term they
were to look for it. A story is related of a man being met who had in
his hands a writing in square Hebrew characters, and in Hebrew, which he
professed to have got from the Persian archives, and in which it was
written that after 4,290 years from the Creation the world would come to
an end. And then would be the wars of the great sea-monsters, and those
of Gog and Magog, and the rest of the time would be the time of the
Messiah, and that the Holy One, blessed be His Name, would only renew
His world after the 7,000 years; to which, however, one Rabbi objects,
making it 5,000 years. Rabbi Nathan speaks of Habakkuk ii. 3 as a
passage so deep as to go down to the abyss, reproving the opinion of the
Rabbis who sought out the meaning of Daniel vii. 25, and of Rabbi
Samlai, who similarly busied himself with Ps. lxxx. 5, and of Rabbi
Akiba, who dwelt upon Haggai ii. 6. But the first kingdom (Babylonian?)
was to last seventy years; the second (Asmonaean?) fifty-two years; and
the rule of the son of Kozebhah (Bar Kakhabh, the false Messiah) two and
a half years. According to Rabbi Samuel, speaking in the name of Rabbi
Jonathan: Let the bones of those be broken who calculate the end,
because they say, They end has come, and the Messiah has not come,
therefore He will notcome at all. But still expect Him, as it is said
(Hab. ii. 3), ‘Though it tarry,wait for it.’ Perphaps thou wilt say: We
wait for Him, but He does not wait for it. On TALMUDIC DISCUSSION THE
MESSIAH. this point Is. xxx. 18. But if so, what hinders? The quality of
judgment. But in that case, why should we wait? In order to recieve,
according to the last clause of xxx. 18. On which follows a further
discussion. Again, Rabh maintains that all the limits of time as regards
the Messiah are past, and that in now only depends on repentance and
goos works whan He shall come. To this Rabbi Samuel objected, but Rabh’s
view was supported by Rabbi Eliezer, who said that if Israel repented
they would be hard like those od Haman, when Israel would repent. The
opinion of Rabbi Eliezer was further supported bt Jer. iii.22,to which
Rabbi Joshua objected by quoting Is. lii. 3, which seemed to imply
thatIsrael’s redemption was not dependent on their repentance and good
works. On this Rabbi Joshua retorted by quoting Mal. iii. 7, to which
again Rabbi Joshua replied by by quoting Jer. iii. 14, and Rabbi Eleizer
then urged Jer. iv. 1, upon which Rabbi Joshua retorted from Dan. xlix.
7. Rabbi Eliezer then urged Jer. iv.1, upon which Rabbi Joshua retorted
from Dan. xii. 7, and so effectually silenced Rabbi Eliezer. On this
Rabbi Abba propounded that there was not a clearer mark of the Messianic
term than that in Is. xxxvi. 8. To which Rabbi Eliezer added Zech. viii.
10. On this the question is raised as to the meaning of the words
‘neitherwas there any peace to him that went out or came in.’ To this
Rabh gave answer that it applied to the disciples of the sages,
according to Ps. cxix. 165. On which Rabbi Samuel replied that at that
time all the entrances would be equal (i.e. that all should be on the
same footing of danger). Rabbi Chanina remarked that the Son of David
would not come till after fish had beeeb sought for for the sick and not
found, according to Ezek. xxxii. 14 in connection with Ezek. xxix. 21.
RabbiChamma, the son of Rabbi Chaina, said that the Son of David would
not come until the vile dominion over Israel had ceased, appealing to
Is. i. 26. Ula saidJerusalem is not to be redeemed, except by
righteousness, according to Is. i. 27We pass over the remarks of Rabbi
Papa, as not adding to the subject. Rabbi Jochanah said: If thou seest a
generation that increasingly diminishes, except Him, which many sorrows
come like a stream, expect Him, according to Is. lix. 19, 20.He also
added: The son of David does not come except in a gemneration where all
are either righteous, or all guilty, the former idea being based on Is.
lx. 21, the latter on Is. lix. 16 and xlviii. 11. Rabbi Alexander said,
that Rabbi Joshua the son of Levi referred to the contradiction in Is.
lx. 22 between the words ‘in his time’ and again ‘I will hasten it,’ and
explained it thus: If they are worthy, I will hasten it, and if not, in
His time. Another similar contradiction between Dan. vii. 13 and Zech.
ix. 9 is thus reconciled: if Israel deserve it, He will come in the
clouds of heaven; if they are not deserving, He will come poor, and
riding upon an ass. Upon this it is remarked that Sabor the King sneered
at Samuel, saying: Yousay that the Messiah is to come upon an ass: I
will send Him my splendid horse. To which the Rabbi replied: Is it of a
hundred colours, like His ass? Rabbi Joshua, the son of Levi, saw
Elijah, who stood at the door of Paradise. He said to him: When shall
the Messiah come? He replied: When that Lord shall come (meaning God).
Rabbi Joshua, the son of Levi,said: I saw two (himself and Elijah), and
I heard the voice of three (besides the former two the Voice ofthe son
of Jochai, and said to him: Shall I attain the world to come? Elijah
replied: If it pleaseth the Lord. Upon which follows the same remark: I
have seen the Messiah come? To ehich the answer is: Go and ask Him
thyself. And where does He abide? At the gate of the city (Rome). And
what is His sign? He abides among the poor, the sick and stricken. And
all unbind, and bind up again the wounds at the same time, but He undoes
(viz the bondage) and rebinds each separately, so that if they call for
Him they may not find him engaged. [1 The Vienna edition of the Ta,mud
has several lacune on this page (98) a)]. He went to meet Him and said:
peace be to Thee, my Rabbi and my Lord. he replied to him: Peace be to
thee, thou son of Levi. he said to Him: When wilt Thou come, my Lord? He
replied to hiim: To-day. Then he turned to Elijah, who said to him: He
has assured and thy Father of the world to come. He said to him: But He
has decieved me in that He said: I come to-day, and he has not come. He
said to them: Have he not promided me that he would not seek a sign?
They said to him: Notwithstanding do it. He said to them: If so, the
waters from the cave of Pamias (one of the sources of the Jordan) shall
be changed into blood. In that moment they were changed into blood. Then
the Rabbi goes on to predict that the land would be overun by enemies,
very stable being filled with their horses. Rabh said that the son of
David not come till the kingdom (i.e foreign domination) should extend
over Israel for nine months, according to Micah v. 3. Ula said: Let Him
come, and may I be found worthy to stand. the shadow of the dung of His
ass (according to some: the tail of his ass). Abayi said Raba: Why has
this been the bearing of your words? If on account of the sorrows of the
Messiah, we have the tradition that Rabbi Eliezer was asked by his
disciples, what a man should do to be freed from the sorrows of the
Messiah; on ehich they were told: By busying yourselves with the Torah,
and with good works. And you are a master lead to occasion of danger. to
this confronting replies are given from Scripture, such as Gen. xxviii.
15, and other passages, some of them being subjected to detailed
commentation. Rabbi Jochanan expressed a similar dislike of seeing the
days of the Messiah, onwhich Resh lakish suggested that it might be on
the ground of Amos v. 19, or rather on that of Jer. xx. 6. Upon this,
such fear before God is accounted for by the consideration that what is
called service above is not like what is called service below (the
family above is not like thr family below), so that one kind may
outweigh the other. Rabbi Giddel said, that Rabh said, that Israel would
rejoice in the years of the Messiah. Rabbi Joseph said: Surely, who else
would rejoice in the years of the Messiah. Rabbi Joseph said: Surely,
who else would rejoice in them? Chillak and Billak? (two imaginary
names, meaning no one). This, to exclude the words of Rabbi Hillel, eho
said: There is no Messiah for Israel, seeing they have had Him in the
time of Hezikiah. Rabh said: The world was only created for David;
Samuel, for Moses; and Rabbi Jochanan, for the Messiah. What is His
Name? The school of Rabbi Jannai said: Jinnon, according to Ps. lxxii.
17. The school of Rabbi Chanina siad: Chaninah, according to Jer.xvi.
13. And some say Menachem, the son of Hezikah, according to Lam. i. 16.
And our Rabbis say: The Leprous One of the house of Rabbi, is His Name,
as it is written is liii. 4.Rabbi Nachman said: It He is among the
living, He is like me, according to Jer. xxx. 21. Rabh said: If He is
among the living, He is like Rabbi jehudah the Holy, and if among the
dead he is like Daniel, the man greatly beloved. Rabbi Jehudah said,
Rabh said: God will raise up to them another David, according to Jer.
xx. 9, a passage which evidently points to the future. Rabbi Papa said
to Abaji: But we have thisother Scripture Ezek. xxxvii. 25, and the two
terms (Messiah and David) stand related like Agustus and Caesar. Rabbi
Samlai illustrated Amos v. 18, by a parable of the cock. and the bat
which were looking for the light. The cock said to the bat: I look for
the light, but of what use is the light to thee? So it happened to a
Sadducee who said to Rabbi Abahu: When will the Messiah come? He
answered him: When darkness covers this people. He said to him: Dost
thou intend to curse me? He replied: Itis said in Scripture Is. lx. 2.
Rabbi eliezer taught: The days of a King,H the Kingthere spoken of being
the unique king, the Messiah. Rabbi said: Three generations, according
to Ps. lxxii. 5. Rabbi Hillel said: Israel shall have no more
Messiah,for they had him in the days of Hezikiah. Rabbi Joseph said: May
god forgive Rabbi Hillel: when did hezikiah live? During the first
Temple. And Zechariah prophesied during the second Temple, and said
Zech. xi. 9. We have the traditionthat Rabbi Eliezer said: The days of
the Messiah are forty years. it is written Deut. vii. 3,4, and again in
Ps xc. 15 (shoeing that the days of rejoicing must be like those of
affliction in the wilderbess). Rabbi Dosa said: Four hundred
yearsquoting Gen. xv. 13 in connection with the same Psalm. Rabbi
thought it was 365 years, according to Is. lxii. 5. Rabbi Jehudah said,
that Rabbi Samuel said, that the days of the Messiah were to be as from
the day that the world was created until now, according to Deut. xi. 21.
Rabbi jehudah said, that Rabbi Samuel said, that the days of the Messiah
were to last for Israel 7,000 years (a Divine marriage-week), according
to Is. lxii. 5. Rabbi Jehudah said, that Rabbi Samuel said, that the
days of the Messiah were to be as from the day that the world was
created until now, according Duet. xi. 21. Rabbi Nacham said: As from
the days of Noah till now, according to Is. liv. 9. Rabbi Chija said,
that Rabbi Jochanan said: All the prophets have only prophesied in
regard of the days of the Messiah; but in regard to the world to come,
eye has not seen, O god, beside Thee, what He hath preparefor him that
waiteth for Him (Is. lxiv. 4). And this is opposed to what Rabbi Samuel
said, that there was no differences between this world and the days of
the Messiah, except that foreign domination would cease. Upon which the
Talmud goes off to discourse upon repentance, and its relation to
perfect righteousness. Lengthy as this extract may be, it will at least
show the infinite differences between the Rabbinic expectation of the
Messiah, and the picture of him presented in the New Testament. Surely
the Messianic idea, as realised in Christ, could not have been derived
from the views current in those times!
