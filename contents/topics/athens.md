Athens was the most important city of Attica in ancient times, the
capital of the same district in New Testament times, and the capital of
the Republic of Greece in the modern era. The name has been derived, so
it would seem, from that of the patron goddess Athena (Minerva).

The city of Athens is important to biblical studies as the scene of
Paul’s famous Areopagus address (Acts 17:15–34). Having been driven from
Berea by the antagonism of the Jews, Paul waited in Athens for the
arrival of his companions, who had remained in Berea for a short time.
It is not known whether Athens was included in Paul’s program of
evangelization or whether the opportunity and stimulus for his preaching
in that city were provided by the circumstances he encountered.

The account in Acts does not make clear whether Paul approached Athens
by land or by sea. If he came by sea he would have landed at Piraeus,
which was the seaport of Athens and the base for her navy. Located 5 mi
(8 km) from Athens, Piraeus was joined to the city by a corridor about
250 ft (75 m) wide protected by walls about 50 ft (15 m) high. Most
likely Paul would have traveled outside these walls in a northeasterly
direction, on the road leading to Athens. On this road Pausanias claims
to have observed “altars to gods called unknown.”

The existence of inscriptions worded in the singular in accordance with
the statement of Paul (Acts 17:23) has been questioned. McDonald,
however, asserts knowledge of two late literary passages that refer to
an unknown god (BA, 4 [1941], 1). Coming by this way, Paul would have
entered the city from the west through the “dipylon” (double gate), from
which a road continuing to the southeast led directly to the agora.

The agora in an ancient city was the focal point of political,
commercial, and social life. Here, as well as in the synagogue, Paul
engaged in discussion with the people, conspicuous among whom were the
Stoics and Epicureans. The agora was a large open space enclosed by
civic and religious buildings. Modern excavators have discovered the
foundations of buildings that correspond substantially with the
description of the agora given by the historian Pausanias. Among these
were the Odeion, or music hall, the stoa of Attalos on the east, and two
long parallel stoas on the south. A stoa was a long narrow pavilion with
a colonnade on one side and a wall on the other. The stoas were the
scene of public lectures and discussions. The circular Tholos on the
west was the meeting place of the executive sections of the Athenian
Council of five hundred. Also on the west were: the Bouleuterion, where
the Council met; the Metroön, the sanctuary of the Mother of the Gods;
the temple of Apollo Patroös; and the stoa of Zeus Eleutherios. The
temple of Ares was toward the center of the open area of the agora.

The AREOPAGUS was directly S of the agora, and the Acropolis was to the
southeast. The Acropolis, a commanding hill 512 ft (156 m) high was
customarily approached from the west, through an ornamental gateway
known as the Propylaea. Here on the south stood the small temple of
Wingless Victory. The top of the hill was dominated by the Parthenon,
which contained a gold and ivory statue of Athena made by Phidias,
Pericles’ sculptor. The Erechtheion stood on the north. This was a
temple erected in honor of Erechtheus, the semi divine hero who is
reputed to have been the first king of Athens, though we cannot be sure
that he was more than a legendary character. The Prytaneion, or town
hall, where the sacred fire of the city was always kept aflame, was on
the north slope of the Acropolis, E of the Agora. North of the
Prytaneion the Roman Forum was built through the generosity of the
Caesars, Julius and Augustus. When Paul visited Athens, the temple of
Olympian Zeus stood unfinished, SE of the Acropolis. When it was
completed, this structure, known as the Olympeion, was the largest
temple in all Greece. The Odeion, or music hall of Pericles, and the
theater of Dionysos stood S and SW of the Acropolis, respectively. The
temple of Hephaestus was located W of the agora on a small hill known as
the Kolonos Agoraios. In the past this temple has been identified
wrongly, at times, as the temple of Theseus. That it is indeed the
Hephaisteion, the temple of the god of fire and metallurgy, has been
confirmed by the discovery of numerous metalworking shops on the slopes
of the hill on which it stands. The Acropolis, which is ideally situated
for defense and water supply, bears evidence of having been inhabited
from earliest times.

Athens, one of the greatest cultural centers of Paul’s day, grew up
around a 520-foot-high rocky plateau called the Acropolis. Here, on this
elevated area, stood the many-columned Parthenon, the far-famed
architectural wonder, and so many other sacred edifices that the place
was called “the many-templed Acropolis.”

To the north of the Acropolis was the celebrated civic center and market
place, known as the Agora, where people not only traded, but also
visited and discussed questions of interest at the time. To the
northwest there extended out from the Acropolis, on a somewhat lower
level, a rocky hill called the Areopagus, or Mars’ Hill, where the
councils and the High Court met.

This limestone hill is situated between the Acropolis and the Agora. In
Roman mythology Mars was the god of war; his counterpart in Greek
mythology was Ares. Many translations of the Bible will use the word
“Areopagus” instead of the phrase “Mars’ Hill” when describing this
location. The word “Areopagus” means “the hill of Ares.”

Both of these well-known places were familiar to Paul. In the Agora he
‘disputed daily with them that met with him,” among whom were the Stoics
and Epicureans, who, with mingled admiration and curiosity, regarded him
as “a setter forth of strange gods”; therefore brought him up the hill
to speak before and to be heard by an informal session of the supreme
court. Standing in the midst of Mars’ Hill, before these representatives
of the best learning of the earth, Paul took as his text “the Unknown
God,” and delivered, with telling effect, one of the most dynamic
messages of all time. Some mocked, some were deeply impressed, while
others were converted then and there.

According to Luke, the apostle Paul only paid one visit to this city.
However, by the time Paul got to Athens most of its glory had already
passed—most of Greece had been plundered by the Romans, and even Athens
had been sacked by Sulla in 86 BC While Paul waited for Silas and
Timothy to join him at Athens, he traveled through the ancient city and
was appalled by the high degree of paganism in the city. An ancient
Proverb claimed that there were more gods in Athens than men, and
wherever Paul looked he could see “that the city was given over to
idols” (Acts 17:16). Paul then “reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews
and with the Gentile worshipers, and in the marketplace daily with those
who happened to be there” (Acts 17:17).

Finally, he had the opportunity to address the philosophers on Mars’
Hill and there proclaimed to them “God, who made the world and
everything in it” (Acts 17:24).

Thanks to the American School of Classical Studies, the Agora has been
uncovered, its streets have been charted, and its ruined buildings
identified. The visitor may now walk among these ruins and contemplate
the past.

The thirty-five stone steps carved in the rock up Mars’ Hill, and traces
of an altar and many rock benches on top of the hill, are visible today.
Thousands of tourists from all parts of the world climb these self-same
steps and, standing on Mars’ Hill, are even now visibly moved by the
words as well as the spirit and power of Paul’s mighty address.

Away to the southwest is the ancient roadway leading to Corinth.

No remains of an altar inscription – “To the Unknown God,” referred to
by Paul, have as yet been found in Athens, but an identical inscription
on an altar was found in 1903 during the excavations of the city of
Pergamum.
