**Introduction.**

Matthew and Luke have taken the time to record the genealogies of our
Lord. Since they wrote under the inspiration of God the Holy Spirit, we
can assume that this information is important.

Thanks to the Pharisees’ fascination with genealogies, at the time that
these men wrote there was a great archive of information on the subject,
and so they were able to accurately trace the line of Christ.

Luke traces the line of Christ through his mother, Mary. That is why
3:23 reads (or should read if it does not) “Jesus… being the son (as was
supposed of Joseph) of Eli…”

-   Women were seldom included in Jewish genealogies, and so Luke only
    had the information about the patrilinear progenitors of Mary. He
    does start with her, however, even though he does not mention her
    name.

-   Luke did take the time to write the complete story of Mary and the
    immaculate conception, so he also took the time to write up her
    lineage.

Matthew traces of the line of Christ through Joseph, and thus back to
Abraham. Luke takes Mary’s line back to Adam.

-   Though Joseph was not Christ’s biological Father, our Lord traced
    his legal heritage through him. That is why Matthew’s line stops at
    Abraham. His line had to do with Israel, and Israel began with
    Abraham.

-   Since the line of Mary is Christ’s biological line, the line is
    traced clear back to Adam.

Both of the genealogies skip generations.

-   This was a common practice in the Jewish handling of these things.

-   The reasons varied. It could be that the information was no longer
    available, or that the genealogist considered a certain generation
    unimportant. The reason does not matter. Just keep this fact in
    mind.

**Luke’s Genealogy.**

Luke’s genealogy is unique in that it traces its line in the opposite
direction from the norm. However, we will start with Adam and go
forward, in spite of Luke’s deviant behavior.

Adam

It is fitting that we start with Adam, because Adam was the first head
of the human race. By looking at Adam’s life we can discover the
beginnings of our problems… and solutions. Adam is perhaps the one man
in these genealogies with the greatest connection to Christ.

Rom 5:12-21, “Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the
world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all
sinned”

When God created Adam, He gave him the legitimate authority to rule
planet earth When God created Adam, He created him body, mind, and
spirit.

-   Adam’s human spirit formed the basis for his relationship with God
    in the Garden.

-   Adam’s body gave him the basis for logistical provision in time and
    space.

-   Adam’s mind gave him the basis for volitional decision and true
    worship of God.

When Adam sinned, the following things happened.

-   He surrendered his authority to rule planet earth to Satan.

-   His human spirit was removed from his body, causing spiritual death.
    He could not pass on this human spirit to future generations.

-   His body received an old sin nature, which would be genetically
    transmitted to all future generations.

-   His mind became corrupted by the old sin nature, but still remained
    functional. He still had a conscience, which contained a frame of
    reference for right and wrong.

Therefore, all of Adam’s progeny would suffer the following
consequences:

-   They would be born spiritually dead, sharing the condemnation for
    Adam’s sin.

-   They would be born with the indwelling presence of the old sin
    nature in the cell structure of their bodies (and yes, genetics
    confirms this).

-   They would be born with a soul, and thus would be able to choose for
    themselves the courses of their lives (and so genetics means very
    little).

-   They would be born with a human conscience, and thus be able to
    discern right from wrong,

Romans 2:14-15, “For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do
instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the law, are a
law to themselves, in that they show the work of the Law written in
their hearts, their conscience bearing witness, and their thoughts
alternately accusing or else defending them…”

Romans 5:13,14, “for until the Law sin was in the world; but sin is not
imputed though [concessive use of the present participle] there is no
law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those
who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type
of Him who was to come.”

The first part of this statement communicates the utter degeneracy of
the post-sin, pre-flood era, and their great hope in the last Adam.

-   The Law of Moses provided very much in the way of Divine
    Establishment restraint on the old sin nature.

-   Without that restraint, the human race became extremely involved in
    the cosmic system, even to the point of sexual relations with
    angels.

-   c. And yet even at that time, their personal sins were not imputed
    to them. They were instead reserved for imputation to Jesus Christ

The second part of the statement has to do with the continued effects of
spiritual death.

-   Although their personal sins were not imputed to them, spiritual
    death still continued unrestrained.

-   This shows the heart of the matter. Real spiritual death has to do
    with the imputation of Adam’s sin. Salvation has to do with the
    imputation of our personal sin into Adam.

-   We did not commit Adam’s sin - Adam did. We do receive the
    imputation of that sin at the moment of human birth.

Romans 5:15,16 contrasts the two Adams:

“But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the
transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God
and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the
many. And the gift is not like that which came through the one who
sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression
resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose
from many transgressions resulting in justification.”

Adam’s original sin resulted in the spiritual death of the entire human
race, except for the second Adam, Jesus Christ.

The work of Christ on the cross in receiving the imputation of the
personal sins of the human race resulted in the opportunity for the
human race to regain spiritual life in God.

Salvation is a free gift, but it must be taken - accepted. It is offered
to the entire human race without exception.

Salvation arose from the sins of all being imputed to the one.

Spiritual death arose from the sins of one being imputed to the all.

Romans 5:17 tells us about realms of power and authority related to sin.

“For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one,
much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of
righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.”

Adam’s sin put Satan into authority in the world and in the human body.
As a result the entire world was enslaved to Satan through the world
branch of the cosmic system.

The individuals of the world were enslaved to him through the individual
branch of the cosmic system; But Christ’s substitutionary spiritual
death gave the human race the authority to take their lives back.

-   The abundance of grace is a brief description of post salvation
    spiritual assets.

-   The gift of righteousness is the imputation of the work of Christ
    into the new believer at salvation.

Therefore even in the devil’s world we can rule our own lives through
God’s control.

Romans 5:18 provides a further explanation of the principle.

“So then just as through one transgression there resulted condemnation
to all men, even so through one act of righteousness [a judicial
sentence, handed down by a judge] there resulted justification of life
to all men.”

The Greek word **dikaio.ma** indicates a judicial sentence passed down
from a judge.

-   In this case, it is the death sentence passed down from God the
    Father to Jesus Christ. Christ died under the sentence of death for
    us.

-   The judicial decision is permanent - and thus lasts for all
    eternity. God will never rescind His judgment of our sins in Jesus
    Christ. We are secure forever because of this.

-   This judicial sentence is also an act of righteousness for the
    perfect Christ chose to die for sinful mankind.

Because of God’s judicial sentence and Christ’s righteous act provide
the basis for our justification.

-   The righteousness of Christ is then imputed to everyone who believes
    in Christ.

-   This righteousness is used by God in order to justify our salvation.
    We are qualified to live forever with Him.

Romans 5:19 begins the summary,

“For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners,
even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made
righteous.”

Adam’s sin was imputed to all, and therefore all were made sinners.

Christ’s work of righteousness on the cross will provide righteousness
to all who believe on Him.

f. The final two verses of the chapter:

Romans 5:19,20, “Now the Law came in the side door [pareiserchomai] so
that the transgression [unbelief - the unforgiveable sin] might increase
[grow in importance as an issue]; but where the sin increased [as an
issue], grace abounded all the more [salvation provision] that, as the
sin reigned through [spiritual] death, even so grace might reign through
righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

The purpose of the Law is not to increase personal sin. Actually it
limits it.

The unforgivable sin, unbelief, is in view here. The unforgivable sin is
the rejection of Christ’s work on the cross.

Because of spiritual death, the imputation of Adam’s sin, the
unforgivable sin ruled and does rule over all those who refuse to
believe in Christ.

The Law increases the unforgivable sin as an issue, because the Law
defines both sin and the grace provision of God.

As sin increased as an issue, so also did grace, and the grace provision
of God.

Eternal life is the sum total of life after salvation for both time and
eternity.

We live eternal life if we take hold of our portfolio of post salvation
provision, and if we live eternal life, then we rule over all aspects of
the cosmic system.

Therefore, in Adam we all died. In Christ, we can all live. This is the
essence of the baptism of the Spirit.

1 Cor 15:20-28 and 35-49, tells us what Adam has to do with our future
life in God.

I Cor. 15:20-22 introduce the matter.

“But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those
who are asleep. For since by a man came death, by a man also came the
resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all
shall be made alive.”

This passage points out there is more to human life than life, and more
to physical death than death.

Physical death is only a tragedy if it occurs while one is also
spiritually dead. Human life is only meaningful insofar as it is
spiritual.

Adam’s sin resulted in the spiritual and physical death of all mankind.
Christ’s death resulted in the provision of salvation for all mankind.

Christ’s resurrection resulted in the provision of a resurrection body
for all believers. Christ was the first to be resurrected, but there
will be many more.

1 Cor. 15:23 and 24 set forth the order of resurrections.

"But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those
who are Christ’s at His coming, then comes the end, when He delivers up
the kingdom to the God and Father, when he has abolished all rule and
all authroity and power.

The word for order in this passage has to do with human organizations of
various kinds. Primarily, it is a word used of military formations. In a
military formation, things always happen in a certain order, and that is
what is in view here.

-   First, Christ is resurrected.

-   Second, all believers from the church age receive their resurrection
    bodies.

-   Third, all believers from all other periods of history are
    resurrected.

-   It is at the end of history that all rule is abolished.

**arche**. is the word for rule, and it serves as the general category.

**exousia** and **dunamis** define the two types of rulership;
**exousia** for legitimate authority, and **dunamis** for illegitimate.

It is all abolished because the kingdom of heaven is put into place,
where Christ rules all.

The kingdom which Christ delivers is His millennial kingdom.

I Cor. 15:25 and 26 explain the reason for the extension of Christ’s
millennial rule,

“For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The
last enemy that will be abolished is death.”

Christ will reign in His kingdom until the job is completely finished.
He reigns from the right hand of the Father even now. He will reign on
planet Earth in the millennium.

In this case, reigning or ruling means more than just sitting on a
throne. It means an active and benevolent rule towards all who are His
rightful subjects. All who believe in Him remain just that - His
rightful subjects.

There are many enemies of Jesus Christ: humans and angels - and even
death.

Death will be the last of these enemies to fall to the power and
authority of Jesus Christ.

Death was brought into the world by Adam, though Satan was Christ’s
first real enemy.

1 Cor. 15:27 and 28 comment on the victory that has already been won.

“For he has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when he
says, ‘All things are put in subjection,’ it is evident that He is
excepted who put all things in subjection to Him. And when all things
are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the
One who subjected all things to Him, that God may be all in all.”

God the Father has placed all things under the rulership of Christ -
positionally. The cross and the resurrection were the dual strategic
victories that absolutely assured the overall victory of God in the
angelic conflict, and completely reversed the adverse effects of Adam’s
sin.

-   The cross was the strategic victory over sin; all the sins of man
    were imputed to Christ on the cross, and judged in Him.

-   The resurrection was the strategic victory over physical and
    spiritual death. Physical death because of the resurrection body;
    spiritual death because of the resurrection mind.

The conflict will continue, even though the handwriting is really on the
wall at this point. Evil fights on though completely beaten.

God the Father is the exception to the rule. All is under Christ’s
subjection because of the cross, resurrection and ascension. God the
Father is the exception to that. He will remain in authority over the
Son forever.

The purpose of this subjection is so that from beginning to end, God
might remain in authority - and it is fitting that He is.

-   He was in authority over Christ in eternity past.

-   He remained in authority throughout human history, and even until
    now.

-   And therefore it is right that he remains forever.

(Verses 29-34 form a parenthetical statement that is not pertinent to
our study, so we will skip them

1 Cor. 15:35 picks up the subject of the actual resurrection.

“But someone will say, ‘How are the dead raised? And with what kind of
body do they come?’”

We know how death came into the world - through Adam’s original sin came
both spiritual and physical death. We should also come to understand how
life will come again.

Paul begins his explanation of the mystery with an analogy from the
world of agriculture. “That which you sow does not come to life unless
it dies; and that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be,
but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.”

-   The seed is planted in the shell of the human body, and the human
    body must die in order for the seed to grow.

-   An entire corn stalk is not sown in order to grow another; just a
    seed, and that is it.

-   An entire resurrection body is not placed inside of our own; just
    the kernel, the seed of one is placed.

1 Cor. 15:38,39 are an explanation of the individuality of the
resurrection bodies of all creatures.

“But God gives it a body just as He willed, and to each of the seeds a
body of its own. All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh
of men and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and
another of fish.”

God made a sovereign decision to make our resurrection bodies in a
certain way. Since it is God’s decision, it is going to be a wonderful
body.

The flesh of each order of creatures is different, and so are the
resurrection bodies of all humans.

Heaven means inequality - among resurrection bodies.

It is impossible to tell from a seed what it will grow into. So it is
with the resurrection body. You cannot tell from looking at someone how
they will turn out in heaven. Only God can tell.

The resurrection body is the result of what you do on earth with your
human spirit, which is the seed.

If you cultivate it and nourish it, it will grow into something
fantastic. If you neglect it, it will be not much.

1 Cor. 15:40,41 continue the explanation.

“There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the
heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another. There is one
glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of
the stars; for star differs from star in glory. So also is the
resurrection of the dead.”

The heavenly bodies are used to analogize the difference in the glory of
the earthly categories. The sun is great and glorious - the moon just
its reflection. Stars are far off and dim. All are different according
to the will of God.

1 Cor. 15:42,43 tell us the about the soil into which the seed of the
resurrection body is sown.

“It is sown in a perishable body, it is raised in an imperishable body;
it is sown in dishonorable, it is raised in glory; it is sown in
weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a soulish body, it is raised
a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual
body.”

The soil into which the seed is planted is the human body. The body is
the perishable, the dishonorable, the weak, the soulish.

The soulish is from the Greek word psuchikos. Soulish is used elsewhere
in Scripture (1 Cor 2:14; James 3:15; Jude 1:19) to connote a person
without a human spirit.

The weakness is from the Greek word astheneia, which emphasizes the
inability of the human to make the conversion.

The perishable is obvious.

The dishonorable points the old sin nature in the cell structure of the
human flesh.

And now a comparison is made between the earthly body of Adam and his
race, and Christ and His followers.

1 Cor. 15:45,46, "So also it is written, ‘The first man, Adam, became a
lving soul.’ The last Adam [Christ] became a life-making spirit.
However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the
spiritual.

Adam’s bad decision resulted in the spiritual death of the entire human
race. This is summed up in the phrase **psuche zosan** - “living soul.”

-   A living soul is one that has human life, but not spiritual.

-   Human life is the sum of biological and soul life, or psuche zosan.

The second man’s, Christ’s, good decision resulted in the spiritual life
of all who would believe in Him.

All who believe are given spiritual life in the form of the human
spirit. All who receive the human spirit have human life, and eternal
life.

The order of things was for Adam to come first, and then Christ. The
problem must appear before the solution.

The conclusion is in 1 Cor. 15:47-49.

“The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.
As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the
heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly. And just as we have borne
the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.”

Seth

Seth was Adam’s third son, and after the death of Abel and the
banishment of Cain, Seth would renew Adam’s line.

Seth represents a new hope and new beginning. He was the appointed
replacement for Abel, and that is the meaning of his name (Gen 4:25-26).

Seth would father Enos at the age of one hundred and five, and he would
die when he was nine hundred and twelve years of age.

During this time in human history, people lived to ages which seem
impossible today.

The line of Christ had been cut off when Cain murdered Abel. Seth is the
renewal of that line. In a sense, he is Abel’s substitute; his
designated hitter.

Enosh

Enos is the Greek rendering of this name, which is more correctly
pronounced Enosh. The Greeks were indiscriminate in their rendering of
the Hebrew sin and shin, and that is why the difference.

There is one significant fact about this man: his life marks the
beginning of the great apostasy of the antediluvian civilization.

Gen 4:26, “to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At
that time men began to cry out against the name of Yahweh.”

The word for ‘begin’ in this verse is **h.Uh.al**, and it means to
pierce or penetrate something for the first time. It had a universally
negative connotation. It referred to rape, and other horrible crimes
that included penetration. It referred to the abuse of land, and even
pollution. In the context of Gen. 4:26, it means to begin something that
should never begin. It is, in essence, a rape of something that was
innocent.

The verb ‘to call’ also can be used in the negative sense. **qArA’**
means in its basic form to call or summon someone. However, in its more
severe connotation, it has the sense of crying out, or screaming against
someone, and that is how it is used here.

The inseparable preposition **‘bh’** is attached to **shEm Yahweh** in
the final part of the verse. This preposition can have many meanings,
but the one that fits best here is ‘against’.

The word **shEm** is translated ‘the name of’. The ancient Hebrews
believed that a person’s name represented his very essence (WKRP).

Therefore, during Enosh’s lifetime, there was a great bitter outcry
against the name of the Lord. This was the beginning of the great period
of apostasy and idolatry that would characterize the antediluvian
civilization.

Enosh himself is not associated with the bitter outcry - it is likely
that he remained faithful to God in spite of public opinion about Him.

Cainan

Although spelled C-a-i-n-a-n in Luke’s translation, this is the
Hellenization of **Qinan** of the Hebrew.

We have no other information on this man, other than his place in the
line of Christ.

Mahalaleel

He is the son of Cainan (Kenan). There is no other reference to this man
in the Bible.

His name literally means, “to the praise of God”.

Enoch

Now we have someone we can talk about.

Genesis 5:22-24 tells his story:

“Enoch lived with God for three hundred years after the birth of
Methuselah (his son). Thus all the days of Enoch came to three hundred
and sixty five years. Enoch lived with God, and he was not, for God took
him.”

Hebrews 11:5 provides us with further interpretation:

“By faith Enoch was transferred [to heaven] so that he should not see
death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the
witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.”

Jude verses 14 and 15 quotes from the apocryphal book of Enoch, and it
says,

“And about these also Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam,
prophesied, saying,”Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of His
holy ones, to execute judgmeent upon all, and to convict all the ungodly
of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and
of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."

When he was sixty five years of age, Enoch was transferred - body, soul,
and spirit - to the presence of God in heaven. There he stayed for three
hundred years, at which time his soul and spirit were painlessly removed
from his body, and he was transferred to paradise.

Enoch also was a prophet while he remained on planet earth, and he
talked about his own generation, as evidenced by his prophecy recorded
in Jude’s epistle.

Enoch lived in a time of great apostasy. This time began during the life
of Enosh, and was fully developed by the time Enoch came around.

The apostasy of that time was unbridled, since the Mosaic law had not
yet been written.

Rom. 5:20, “And the Law came in the side door, so that the sin might
increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.”

The time included a tremendous amount of demonism, even to the point of
sexual relations with them. The demons were attacking the genetic line
of Christ, hoping to pollute His human genetic purity and thus destroy
His role as mediator.

Therefore, they seduced human women (and only women), and impregnated
them. By the time of Noah’s life, all but Noah’s family had succumbed.

The human women were weakened by their hatred of God (see Enosh), and
easily enticed by the attractiveness of these demons.

There was great violence, and the human race was in a constant state of
war. The half-angelic humans had great superhuman powers (see Hermes,
Aphrodite, Apollo, Neptune, etc.), and they were superintelligent and
superattractive (see Helen of Troy and Aphrodite) as well.

Many strange and terrible creatures roamed the earth, the brood of
demons. Their fossil record remains - thanks to the great fossilizing
powers of the flood.

It was in this time that Enoch lived, moved to maturity following the
plan of God, and was transferred to heaven by the omnipotence of God.
Enoch did not see physical death because of his maturity, and he stands
as a precursor to resurrection.

-   Although Enoch was not truly resurrected, his transfer to heaven was
    very much like a resurrection.

-   During all his time in heaven, Enoch stayed in his human body, yet
    face to face with God. It is probably a comment on his maturity that
    he was able to stand it, though in his sinful body.

-   After three hundred years of life with God, he was then transferred
    to paradise, under the earth.

-   At the resurrection of Christ he was transferred to heaven along
    with all the Old Testament Saints.

Methuselah

Methuselah is Enoch’s son, and Lamech’s father. His name means “man of
the dart”. It is an intriguing name, but we do not have the foggiest
idea why.

Methuselah has the distinction of being the oldest man in Biblical
history, and perhaps of all time.

Long life was a sign of blessing during Biblical times, and was
synonymous with quality of life. This being true, then Methuselah
represents the quality of eternal life within Christ’s line.

Lamech

Lamech forms the link between Methuselah and Noah. He lived to the age
of 777.

Nothing else is known of Lamech, but if he raised Noah, it is likely he
raised him right.

Noah

Gen. 6:1-2, “Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face
of the land, and daughters were born to them. The sons of God [fallen
angels] saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took
wives for themselves, whomever they chose.”

This is the period of history which we have studied so closely the last
few sections. Again, it was exceptionally degenerate, with little in the
way of checks and balances.

Gen. 6:3, “Then the Lord said,”My Spirit shall not contend in man
forever, because he is flesh in his going astray; but his days will be
one hundred and twenty years."

God the Holy Spirit was working non-stop during that time. He was
contending with the souls of the human race, convicting them, judging
their acts, so that they might turn to God through Jesus Christ.

From this moment on, there would be one hundred and twenty years and no
more.

Gen. 6:4, “The Mephilim were on the earth in those days, and also
afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and
they bore children to them. Those [children] were the mighty men who
were of old, men of renown.”

This verse makes the origin of the Nephilim quite clear. They are the
offspring of fallen angels and human women.

It also identifies the Nephilim with the age of heroes, made famous by
the oral tradition that came through Noah and his sons.

Gen 6:5-7 gives us God’s evaluation of this period of time:

“Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth,
and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually.. An the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth,
and He was grieved in His heart. And the Lord said, ’I will blot out man
whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to
creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made
them.”

The revelations of Divine emotion in this passage are really
anthropopathisms. These are the assignment of human emotions to God in
order to explain some aspect of Divine policy. It is an easy way to
explain the doctrine of dispensations to the uninitiated.

God did not grieve, and He was not sorry. It only appeared so because of
the dispensational change of policy. It was time to judge the present
civilization and move on to the next.

It was all a part of the Divine outline of history, and it did not mean
that God did not know about this apostasy in eternity past.

It is true that this was not God’s direct will for the people of this
time, and that he was saddened by their negative volition.

Gen. 6:8-9 tells us God’s evaluation of Noah,

“But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord… Noah was a righteous man,
blameless in his time; Noah walked with God.”

The “eyes” of God represent his evaluative abilities, measuring Noah to
His standards of righteousness.

The only way that Noah could have done so is through God’s grace plan,
including belief in the future savior, Jesus Christ.

That Noah walked with God is a sure indication of his fulfillment of
God’s post-salvation plan.

Gen. 6:10-22 records God’s plan for the destruction of life on planet
earth, and Noah’s salvation. A flood will come, so Noah will need a
boat. The waters will come from above and below the earth - Gen 7:11.

Noah will save many of the earth’s animal species - Gen. 7:13-16. Many
others will be destroyed - Gen. 7:21-23.

Due to the intermingling of salt and fresh water, and the amount of silt
in the water, all but the hardiest of the fish would be killed as well.

Thus Noah and his family were preserved; while the others died to await
their future judgment.

Noah’s three sons and their wives repopulated the earth, and began the
post-diluvian civilization.

Shem

Shem was a voyager on the ark, and the firstborn son of Noah. He cared
for his nephew Canaan after it was discovered that he had been abused by
his father Ham, Genesis 9:20-27.

In that account, He is called blessed by Noah - a recognition of his
spiritual maturity.

**Christ’s Genealogy from Shem to Abraham**

Introduction

When Noah began the building of the ark, God made a covenant with him.

Gen 6:18, “But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall
enter the ark - you and your sons and your wife, and your sons wives
with you.”

Entering the ark was equivalent to entering in to the covenant with God.
The covenant was continued when Noah made his sacrifice at the landfall
of the ark - when he left the ark (this was really the first ark of the
covenant).

Gen. 8:20, “Then Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every
clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the
altar.”

God spells out the details of the covenant:

Gen. 8:21, “And the Lord smelled the soothing aroma; and the Lord said
in His heart, ’I shall not again personally cause the cursing of the
earth because of man. There is evil in the imagination of man from his
infanthood. And I shall not again personally cause the destroying of
every living creature as I have done.”

So, God makes a promise to Noah, and to the entire human race, even to
you and I in this passage. He will never again flood the earth with
water.

-   This is the background to the verb which is translated ‘cursing’.

-   **qalal** means to diminish something. When it is used of water, it
    means to drain it.

-   It is this same verb which is used to describe the draining of the
    water after the flood.

-   The word used for ‘earth’ is Adamah. Adamah in the feminine means
    earth and all its inhabitants, and so it is here.

-   The final part place the blame squarely where it belongs: on man.

-   Therefore, this is a promise, specifically, to never flood the earth
    for what man has done.

The second part has to do with the destruction of all life. God will not
destroy all life on the earth.

Notice the comment in between: There is evil in the imagination of man
from his infanthood."

In spite of man’s evil imagination, God will not again destroy the earth
and its inhabitants. Man’s imagination is evil from infanthood, and note
not from his youth.

In Gen. 8:22, the future conditions of the planet are defined:

“While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and
summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.”

With the tilting of the earth’s axis, all of the named conditions will
exist. This is in contrast to the previous stable conditions of the
planet. The environment is going to be rougher from here on out.

Man’s relationship to the animal kingdom is changed by the new covenant,
as described in Gen. 9:2-4.

“And the respect of you and the terror of you shall be on every beast of
the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on
the gournd, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given.
Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to
you, as I did the green plant. Only you shall not eat flesh with its
life, its blood.”

The change means that the beasts will respect good human beings, and be
terrified of the bad. In all cases their subordination is required. It
is because of fear that animals are violent.

All animals are now O.K. to eat. The lifeblood of that creature must be
drained before it is eaten, but that is the only requirement.

The third part of the covenant had to do with capital punishment.

Gen. 9:5-6, “And surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast
I will require it. And from every man, from every man’s brother I will
require the life of man. Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man his blood
shall be shed, for in the image of God He made man.”

This is crucial, for before the flood there was no capital punishment,
which is the major restraint on criminal activity. Capital punishment is
ordained from this moment forward. If man or beast kills a man, he will
be killed by man.

This would be a major difference from before the flood. Man is now
responsible for policing himself, which provides a restraint on the
function of the old sin nature.

The fourth part of the covenant is the sign of the promise.

Read Gen. 9:8-17

So the covenant is made and the transfer is made to post-diluvian
civilization. Let’s pick up the line of Christ again with Shem.

Shem

Shem was the son of Noah. He was about 98 years old when he entered the
ark with the rest of his family. He fathered many children, including
Arphaxad, who would carry the line of Christ.

The land occupied by the descendants of Shem (Gen. 10:21-31) encompasses
all of what would become the Jews under the covenant of Abraham. It
includes Syria, Chaldea, parts of Assyria, Persia, and the Arabian
peninsula.

Noah predicts that the people of Canaan would serve under the Semites.

Arphaxad, or Arphachshad

He was born two years after the flood, conceived not long after the ark
hit dry land.

He apparently settled in the mountainous country in the Northeast, and
we really do not know much else about this man.

Cainan

Cainan was the son of Arphaxad. He is not mentioned in the original
table of nations in Gen., but for some reason Moses skipped him and went
to his son, Shelah. Nothing else is known about this man.

Shelah

The son of Cainan; the father of Heber.

Heber

This man’s name means ‘fellowship’. In the Hebrew, it is really Eber.

The son of Shelah, the father of Peleg.

He is the founder of the Hebrew race, and he gave his name to it, Gen.
10:21.

Peleg

His name means division, and it was during his lifetime that the nations
were divided.

The first crisis of the postdiluvian civilization was due to the tower
of Babel. When God put down that attempt, the nations of the earth were
formed, and the earth divided into geographical national boundaries for
the very first time.

Reu

He is the son of Peleg and the father of Serug. His name means,
‘friend’. Nothing else is known.

Serug

He is the son of Reu. His name means ‘shoot, or tendril’ in the Hebrew.
There is an ancient city by this name, and it may have something to do
with this man.

Nahor

Do not confuse this man with the brother of Abraham. This Nahor lived in
the 23rd century BC, and is the grandfather of Abraham. His name means
snorting or snoring.

Terah

He was born in Ur of the Chaldees. His name means ‘antelope’. Joshua
24:2 tells us that this man was involved in idolatry. He did take place
in the big move to Canaan, with the rest of the family. He died about
2100 BC

**The Abraham Connection**

From Abraham to David, there are fourteen generations.
Abraham-Isaac-Jacob-Judah-Perez-Hezron-Ram-Admin-Amminadab-Nahshon-Salmon-Boaz-Obed-Jesse-David.

Between the genealogies in Luke and Matthew there is only one
difference, and that is the Luke’s insertion of Admin between Ram and
Amminadab. This points out the reality of skipped generations in
genealogy lists.

It was a common practice to skip a generation and go from grandfather to
grandson. Sometimes that generation was skipped due to a spiritual
failure in the person in question; more often, there is no reason given.

We will concentrate on Abraham, Nahshon, and Boaz in this line.

This line covers the age of the patriarchs, from God’s covenant with
Abraham to the next covenant with David. Its chronology runs from
Abraham’s birth in 2160 BC to Israel under king Saul in 1004 BC

Abraham.

Gen 12:1-3 records Abram’s first call:

“Now the Lord said to Abram, ‘Go forth from your country, and from your
relatives and from your father’s house, to the land which I will show
you; And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make
your name great; and so you shall be a blessing; and I will bless those
who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all
the families of the earth will be blessed.’”

Abraham had to leave his own country because God had a wonderful place
reserved for him and his progeny. He also had to leave because his first
home and his family and relatives would have been a fatal distraction to
him.

The covenants to Israel.

God provided the nation of Israel a fantastic portfolio of grace
blessings in the form of covenants. A covenant is based on the
attributes of God.

-   It finds its motive in the love of God. There is nothing treacherous
    or deceitful about a covenant.

-   It finds its modus operandi in grace. God gives based on his
    thinking, power, and merit.

-   It finds its dependability in faithfulness. The blessings always
    wait for Israel to take them.

-   It finds its timing and organization in order. Everything is
    arranged by the capabilities of God in eternity past.

-   It finds its enactment in the sovereignty of God. God chooses to
    bless Israel.

-   It finds its revelation in the truth of God. God is forthright and
    clear and honest in His communication of the details of His
    covenants. He always keeps His Word.

The only thing that Israel is to provide is their acceptance of the very
first covenant, which is the spiritual one. The spiritual covenant is
the relationship with God provision. In it, God provides Israel with
everything that they need to have a national relationship with Him.

-   They have the information that they need in order to have a
    relationship with Him.

-   They have the power that they need in order to have a relationship
    with Him.

-   They have the righteousness that they need in order to have a
    relationship with Him.

This relationship with God is the greatest of all the covenants, and it
provides the best of the blessings.

Abraham is an example: until he got his relationship with God on track,
he would not receive the remainder of his covenant blessings.

During the age of Israel, only racial Jews receive the blessings of the
covenants to Israel.

Individual Gentiles may still fulfill the plan of God for individuals,
and they may share in the covenants to Israel by way of blessing by
association.

The covenant to Abraham includes the promised land, a new and unique
race, blessing by association to all who bless his race, a curse on the
anti-Semitic, and a messianic clause.

-   The land is defined in Gen 15:18-21.

-   The Jews must fulfill the spiritual covenant, and accept Christ as
    Messiah in order to fully inherit this land. This will not occur
    until the second advent of Christ. This is the messianic clause.

-   The new and unique race is formed at the conception of Abraham’s
    first son by Sarah, providing a brand new genetic race through the
    seed of Abraham.

-   All who bless the Jews are in turn blessed by God. Throughout
    history the Jews encounter a massive amount of murderous
    persecution. Whenever a person or a nation provides protection, or
    aides them in some way, or just has a virtuous mental attitude about
    their race, that person or nation is blessed by God.

-   All who curse the Jews are in turn cursed by God. anti-Semitism is a
    death wish.

Abram did as the Lord commanded, and went out from Ur when he was 75
years of age.

Abram means, “top father (as in rank), or exalted father (as in
respect)”.

Sarai means, “contentious woman”.

When he arrived in the new land at Shechem, he worshipped God. Soon
after Abram arrived in the new land, a terrible famine hit, and he went
down to Egypt to eat. This caused a complication.

-   Abram feared that he would be killed by the Egyptians if they knew
    that Sarai was his wife, because she was very beautiful.

-   He was an oaf, and cared more about his safety than what would
    happen to Sarai in the Egyptian harem.

-   Therefore, he lied to the Egyptians, and told them that Sarai was
    his sister.

-   Pharaoh took Sarai for his own, but by stealing her (unwittingly)
    from Abram he was the first to invoke the cursing clause of the
    Abrahamic covenant.

-   When the cursing hit, Sarai blabbed the whole deal to Pharaoh, and
    so Pharaoh was upset with Abram, but he did not kill him! He was
    honorable and gave Sarai back and sent the whole entourage back to
    Canaan.

-   When he arrived, Abram held a worship service in honor of the Lord.
    Apparently he had recovered from his devious ways.

When Abram returned to the land, he and his nephew Lot were so
prosperous that their herds were always getting tangled together, and
their shepherds were at the point of engaging in a range war. Therefore,
Lot decided to go down into the Jordan valley with his bunch in order to
avoid further confrontations.

After a time, Lot became entangled in a local war. Genesis 14 tells the
story.

-   When Lot was living down in the Jordan valley, the kings of Sodom
    and Gomorrah fought a big battle, where they were defeated.

-   Lot got himself tangled up in it all somehow, and he was captured by
    the victors. They took their spoil and Lot as well and left for
    points North.

-   Abram heard about this and did the honorable thing: he took the men
    of his household, 318 all told, and formed them into a fighting
    force.

-   They must have been well trained, because they pulled off the most
    difficult of all military maneuvers, a coordinated night action.

-   They rescued Lot and all his goods, and returned to their homes.

It is here that Abram has another worship service.

Next is the story of Abraham’s offspring.

Abraham’s Offspring

The story of Sarai’s treachery begins in Genesis 16.

“Now Sarai, Abram’s wife had borne him no children, and she had an
Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar. So Sarai said to Abram, ‘Now behold,
the Lord has prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to may
maid; perhaps I shall be built up through her.’ And Abram listened to
the voice of Sarai. And after Abram had lived ten years in the land of
Canaan, Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave
her to her husband Abram as his wife. And he went in to Hagar, and she
conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was
despised in her sight. And Sarai said to Abram, ‘May the wrong done me
be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms; but when she saw she had
conceived, I was despised in her sight. May the Lord judge between you
and me.’”

This was not a good marriage. We have already seen the treachery of
Abraham, and now it is Sarai’s turn.

Sarai is barren, and no doubt she had quite a complex about it. So Sarai
conceives a plan. Maybe Abram was bugging her all the time about
children. Maybe the incident with Pharaoh had turned her off to him in
some way.

Because of all this, Sarai just wanted to get it over with. However, she
did not realize, that God’s plan included her as well.

And Abraham was dumb enough to go along with the plan.

Of course, Hagar conceived right away, and after living for so long with
Sarai, the contentious woman and no doubt the contentious master, she
could not help but exult over her.

Poor Sarai. Her plan had failed miserably. What was worse, she had this
daily reminder of her failure to give Abram an heir. Every time that
Hagar craved new and unusual food combinations she probably winked in
Sarai’s direction.

The first thing that Sarai did was to try to take it out on her husband.
“I may have suggested it, but you didn’t have to go through with it.
This is all your fault!” She had become quite irrational.

The second thing that Sarai did was to try to take it out on Hagar. She
verbally and mentally and physically abused this poor pregnant woman.
Hagar had to leave.

But the Lord would deal justly with Hagar, and she believed in him, and
returned to the authority of Sarai, and things were better from then.

Now this plan had backfired terribly, and both Abram and Sarai suffered
for it.

There is no Biblical record of the next fifteen years. But we know from
the next part of their lives, Abram and Sarai have improved their
relationship with God tremendously.

In Genesis 17, the story picks up again.

"Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram
and said to him, ‘I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be blameless.
And I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply
you exceedingly.’ And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him,
saying, ‘As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you will be the
father of a multitude of nations. No longer will your name be called
Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I will make you the father of
a multitude of nations. And I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I
will make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you. And I
will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after
you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God
to you and to your descendants after you. And I will give to you and to
your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land
of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.’

God renews the covenant with Abram because Abram has grown spiritually
to the point where he has capacity for all the great covenant blessing
that God has prepared for him.

Abram falls on his face because he now has true humility. This is a
humility that can only come from an intimate knowledge of God. Abram
developed that knowledge over the fifteen years since the Hagar
disaster.

Now Abram is Abraham, the father of a multitude. Now he is ready for the
next test.

Gen. 16:9, “God said further to Abraham, ‘Now as for you, you will keep
My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their
generations. This is My covenant, which you will keep, between Me and
you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be
circumcised. And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin;
and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you.’”

Had Abraham not been a mature believer, he probably would have said
something along the lines of, “You want me to do what to my what?!”
Instead, he humbly complies.

And, he must have been a great leader, because his entire household was
under the requirement as well. “You want us to do what to our whats?!”

But this was the beginning of the miraculous birth of Isaac.

The Birth of Isaac

Gen. 17:15, “Then God said to Abraham, ‘As for Sarai your wife, you will
not call her name Sarai, but Sarah will be her name. And I will bless
her, and she will be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come
from her.’ Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his
heart, ‘Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will
Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?’ And Abraham said to God,
‘Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!’ But God said, ‘No, but Sarah
your wife will bear you a son, and you will call his name Isaac; and I
will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his
descendants after him.’”

The birth of Isaac would mean the creation of a new race on the planet -
the race of the Jew.

The new race had these assets:

-   Client nation status. They were a nation that had a special
    relationship with God, and they were used as a witness to the entire
    world.

-   A special code, in the Mosaic Law.

-   A great land in which to live.

-   Fantastic leadership, in the Davidic dynasty.

-   A wonderful future, under the leadership of Jesus Christ in the
    Millennium.

-   Unique mental prosperity, which provides the basis for success in
    any endeavor.

The purpose for the new race was to represent God as a witness to the
entire world during the last half of the Old Testament dispensation; to
stand as the sole witness to the world during the tribulation; to serve
as the basis for the people of the millennium.

The new race was being propagated for their leader, who would come more
than two thousand years later.

The impact of the new race in history. Pro-Semitism would always receive
blessing by association. Anti-Semitism would always receive cursing by
association.

In this passage, Abraham listens to what God has to say, and comes to an
erroneous conclusion.

-   He thinks it through, laughing all the while.

-   Sarah cannot have children.

-   I cannot give her what she needs to have children.

-   Then the Lord must want to use Ishmael as my seed, and must have all
    along!

-   Wrong, says God.

Isaac to Jesse

**Isaac** was born to Abraham and Sarah. He would marry Rebekah, and
father the twins, Jacob and Esau. It is worthwhile to note that Rebekah,
too, was barren. She was the second in the line to find healing in God.
Another miracle to continue the line of Christ.

**Jacob**. This man was no prince, at least at first. He took advantage
of his older brother, Esau, and took his birthright from him. Later he
would wrestle with God, and in that match he would win God’s respect.
God changed his name to Israel, ‘wrestler with God’.

**Judah** was one of the twelve sons of Israel. Tamar, the widow of both
his first and second sons, tricked him into sexual relations by
disguising herself has a prostitute. Tamar did this as revenge, because
Judah had wronged her by not giving her to his third son. She became
pregnant by this liaison, and bore him twin sons. Judah would go on to
spiritual maturity, in spite of his early handicaps.

**Perez** was the second born son of Judah, the second of twins.
However, he was the one through which the line of Christ would run. Not
much is know about this man, except his birth.

**Hezron** forms a link in the genealogy, but not much else is known
about him.

**Ram** forms another link.

**Amminadab** We know only one thing about this man: His daughter was
the wife of Aaron the High Priest under Moses. He was a man of the
Exodus, and he died in the desert.

**Nahshon**. Now we can tell something of this man. His sister Elisheba
was married to Aaron. He was also a man of the Exodus generation, the
captain of the tribe of Judah. He must have been a talented military
leader, but he died in the desert with the rest of his generation.

**Salmon** married Rahab, the famous prostitute of Jericho. Although
little is mentioned of Salmon, Rahab deserves mention.

-   She was a prostitute in the town of Jericho, and when two spies from
    the army of Israel come to scout the town they are going to destroy,
    they happen upon Rahab’s house of ill repute (O.K., even 3500 years
    ago military men had an instinct for this sort of thing).

-   She saved these two spies from certain death by hiding them.

-   Rahab speaks to the two spies, and here is what she said, “I know
    that the Lord has given you the land, and that the terror of you has
    fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted
    away before you. For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water
    of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you
    did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to
    Sihan and Og, who you totally destroyed. And when we heard it, our
    hearts melted and no courage remained in any man any longer because
    of you; for the Lord you God, He is God in heaven above and on earth
    beneath.”

-   Then the spies promise her that she and her family will be spared,
    and they are.

Rahab and her extended family were the only survivors of the town of
Jericho. All the others were killed. Rahab lived out her years with the
nation of Israel, and she married Salmon.

**Boaz** was the son of Salmon and Rahab the prostitute. It was his
destiny to marry a foreign woman named Ruth.

-   Elimelech lived in Bethlehem with his wife Naomi and two sons,
    Mahlon and Chilion.

-   A famine came upon the land, and so Elimelech took his wife and sons
    to the land of Moab.

-   Elimelech died in Moab, and after his death, his sons took Moabite
    women for wives. Their names were Ruth and Orpah (not Oprah).

-   Sadly, both the sons also died before they could give sons to their
    wives.

-   After some quibbling, Ruth determined to return to Bethlehem with
    her mother in law, while the other daughter in law stayed in Moab.

-   Ruth believed in God, and she wanted to be in the land of promise.

-   By her hard work in the fields she earned the respect of Boaz, a man
    of Bethlehem, and eventually he would marry her.

-   Through Ruth and Boaz, the line of Christ was continued.

**Obed** was the son of Ruth and Boaz, and he was the grandfather of
David.

**Jesse**, Obed’s son, was David’s father.

Up to this point, we have studied some of the covenants of God with
Israel.

The **Noahic Covenant**, where God promised never again to destroy the
world by flood, and where God established man’s responsibility to
capital punishment.

The **Abrahamic Covenant**, where God established a new racial species.

The **Mosaic Covenant**, which was the national policy covenant for the
nation of Israel.

Next God established the **Davidic**, or Messianic, Covenant. This was
the leadership covenant for the nation of Israel.

The leadership covenant for Israel described a man who would be their
great leader, and who would combine the three offices of prophet,
priest, and king.

Christ fulfilled all three covenants.

As prophet, He spoke of His kingdom, and offered it to the Jews, but
they rejected Him.

As priest, he died for the sins of the world, but the Jews would not
receive Him.

Because the Jews rejected Christ as prophet and priest, He could not be
their king, which was their only desire. Because of the Jew’s rejection
of Christ, His earthly kingdom was delayed, and the church age was
inserted into history.

The Jews were not unlike many other people in history. They desired an
outside solution to their problems, a panacea that would remove their
troubles quickly and permanently.

-   They did not see that their humility was required, and the
    circumcision of their hearts needed to precede the rescue of their
    nation.

-   They were too proud to back down from their arrogant legalism, and
    love of the cosmic system.

-   From their pride they desired a king that would solve their
    problems, so that they could go on with their arrogance.

-   From their pride they rejected the man who was also a prophet and a
    priest.

-   There are many passages in the Old Testament which refer to the
    Messiah, the king after the pattern of David.

Gen 3:15, “I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your
seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his
heel.”

This is the first prediction of the Messiah. It communicates to Satan
that the future Messiah will come from the seed of the woman.

Because of the process of meiosis, each month the woman produces an ovum
which is without the genetic pollution of the old sin nature. This made
it possible for Mary to conceive by the Holy Spirit, and bring forth a
child that did not have the old sin nature, and thus would not receive
the condemnation of Adam’s original sin.

The last part of the prophecy concerns the ultimate victory of Christ.
Christ will wound the head of Satan. This is a metaphor, and can refer
to many things. It is probably a reference to the death, resurrection,
ascension, and session of Christ.

Satan will wound the heel of Christ. Although this is often interpreted
as referring to the cross, the meaning of \`Aqibh does not lend itself
well to this. More likely it refers to the followers of Jesus Christ,
who are subject to persecution throughout the ages. This is likely
especially in light of its position opposite of **rO’sh**, head.

Gen 12:3, “I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I
will curse;and by you all the families of the earth shall bless
themselves.”

Of course, this is the Abrahamic covenant. Through the seed of Abraham
came Christ, and through the death of Christ all nations and all people
were blessed.

Gen 22:18, “and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth
bless themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.”

This is a reaffirmation of the Abrahamic covenant.

The reflexive pronoun ‘themselves’ denotes the function of volition
related to salvation and post salvation spiritual growth.

Christ the Messiah is the source of these blessings.

Gen. 49:8,10, "Judah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be
on the neck of your enemies; your father’s sons shall bow down before
you. The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from
between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs; and to him shall be
the obedience of the peoples.

These verse confirm that the Messianic line runs through Judah.

It also emphasizes the royalty of the Messiah - that he would be a king.

Deut 18:18, “I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among
their brethren; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak
to them all that I command him.”

This is a preview of the prophetic office and function of Christ. Christ
will speak only what God commands.

It is worthwhile to note that the Jews had this verse available to them,
and yet they still rejected Christ.

2 Sam 7:11-16, "from the time that I appointed judges over my people
Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the
LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house.

When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will
raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body,
and I will establish his kingdom.

He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of
his kingdom for ever.

I will be his father, and he shall be my son. When he commits iniquity,
I will chasten him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of
men;

but I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from Saul,
whom I put away from before you.

And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before me;
your throne shall be established for ever.’"

This is a prediction of the coming of king David. Furthermore, it
predicts that the house of David will last forever. It also describes
the relationship of God to the Messiah: Father to Son.

It hints at the death of the Messiah - that He will take the stripes
(the whipping) of men.

2 Sam 23:5, “Yea, does not my house stand so with God? For he has made
with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and secure. For
will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?”

Here is communicated the everlasting nature of the Davidic covenant. It
exists in the Divine decree. It is secure, regardless of what Israel
will do, and they will do a lot. Also it is the communication of the
prosperity which comes from the Messiah.

Psalm 2, "Why do the nations conspire, and the peoples plot in vain?

The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
together, against the LORD and his anointed, saying,

“Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast their cords from us.”

He who sits in the heavens laughs; the LORD has them in derision.

Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury,
saying,

“I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill.”

I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my son,
today I have begotten you.

Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of
the earth your possession.

You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a
potter’s vessel."

Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.

Serve the LORD with fear, with trembling

kiss his feet, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way; for his
wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him."

This is the first reference to the Messiah as the anointed one. The word
‘Christ’ means ‘anointed one’.

Anointing with oil was a metaphor for the ministry of the Spirit.

-   People in ancient times used oil for light. The Spirit sheds His
    light on the Word, so that we might understand it.

-   People in ancient times used oil for a medicinal ointment. The
    ministry of the Spirit with the Word heals our souls.

-   People in ancient times used oil as a cosmetic. The ministry of the
    Spirit leads to true beauty - the beauty of the soul full of Truth.

-   People in ancient times used oil to anoint the bodies of the dead.
    The Spirit is the member of the Godhead who resurrects the dead.

-   People in ancient times used oil to cook and flavor their food. The
    ministry of the Spirit in the Word flavors our lives, making them
    not only palatable, but enjoyable.

Christ was the Messiah, the anointed one. He is the keystone of our
faith, and without Him and all that He has done our faith has no
meaning. The Spirit ministered to our Lord from his birth. In Jesus
Christ was manifest the fullness of the Holy Spirit - all of the things
that anointing represents.

Psalm 16, "Preserve me, O God, for in thee I take refuge.

I say to the LORD, “Thou art my Lord; I have no good apart from thee.”
As for the saints in the land, they are the noble, in whom is all my
delight. Those who choose another god multiply their sorrows; their
libations of blood I will not pour out or take their names upon my lips.

The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; thou holdest my lot.

The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
heritage.

I bless the LORD who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart
instructs me.

I keep the LORD always before me; because he is at my right hand, I
shall not be moved.

Therefore my heart is glad, and my soul rejoices; my body also dwells
secure.

For thou dost not give me up to Sheol, or let thy godly one see the Pit.

Thou dost show me the path of life; in thy presence there is fulness of
joy, in thy right hand are pleasures for evermore."

The key phrase in this passage is “in thy right hand”. Jesus Christ
would sit down at the right hand of God after the ascension. This is
called His Session.

The session of Christ represents the finished state of all His work, and
the accomplishment of the strategic victory of the angelic conflict.

Read Psalm 22.

This is a long passage that records with perfect accuracy the first
person narrative of Christ on the cross.

The gospels have very little information on what Christ thought while He
was dying for our sins - just a few short verbal expressions. However,
the thoughts were recorded one thousand years before the event - in this
Psalm.

The physical details given in this Psalm hit the experience of
crucifixion right on the head. In fact, there is no other explanation.

Read Psalm 110

In this passage there is a repetition of the session of Christ.
Furthermore, it emphasizes the royalty of the Messiah, and his
priesthood.

Melchizedek was a priest and a king during the age of the patriarchs. He
once had a brief association with Abraham. Melchizedek was the king of
Salem, which was the city of Jerusalem at that time. Christ will be the
king of Jerusalem in the millennium and in the eternal state.

Finally, there is mention of His sovereignty, which He will reveal to
the entire world for the first time at the second advent.

Read Isaiah 2.

Isaiah chapter two concentrates on the millennial rule of Christ. Christ
will rule over a magnificent kingdom, in which peace and prosperity are
the rule.

All the arrogance of man and the fallen angels is brought down, because
of the greatness of the day of the Lord. An end will come to all
idolatry. An utter and final end.

You should note that this passage hints at the idea of idolatry as being
the source of the earth’s many ills, including poverty and war.

Isaiah 7:14 records two details concerning the Messiah. That His mother
will conceive Him while a virgin, and she will call His name Immanuel.

Isaiah 9:1-7, “But there will be no more gloom for her who was in
anguish; in earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of
Naphtali with contempt, but later on He shall make it glorious, by the
way of the sea, on the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
The people who walk in darkness will see a great light; those who live
in a dark land, the light will shine on them. Thou shalt multiply the
nation, thou shalt increase their gladness; they will be glad in Thy
presence as with the gladness of harvest, as men rejoice when they
divide the spoil. For Thou shalt break the yoke of their burden and the
staff on their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, as at the battle
of Midian. For every boot of the booted warrior in the battle tumult,
and cloak rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire. For a
child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; and the governement
will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called Wonderful
Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. There will be no
end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of
David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with
justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore. The zeal of the
Lord of hosts will accomplish this.”

Here again is the millennial reign of Jesus Christ.

Also, this passage establishes the location of the hometown of Christ,
and the place where much of His ministry will take place.

Zebulun and Naphtali are two tribes of Israel. Their tribal boundaries
form the area to the West and Southwest of the Sea of Galilee.

Included in these territories is the town of Nazareth, the hometown of
Jesus Christ.

They are made glorious because of the ministry of Christ around them.

Isaiah 11:1-5, “Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a
branch from his roots will bear fruit. And the Spirit of the Lord will
rest on Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of
counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.
And He will delight in the fear of the Lord, and He will not judge by
what His eyes see, nor make a decision by what His ears hear; but with
righteousness He will judge the poor, and decide with fairness for the
afflicted of the earth; and He will strike the earth with the rod of His
mouth, and with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked. Also
righteousness will be the belt about His lins, and faithfulness the belt
about His waist.”

This passage concentrates on the prophetic character of Christ.

Through the Spirit and the Word, Christ will be the greatest prophet of
all time.

Isaiah 40 proclaims the coming of the Messiah to the people of Israel.

Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
and cry to her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned,
that she has received from the LORD’s hand double for all her sins. A
voice cries: “In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make
straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be
lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground
shall become level, and the rough places a plain. And the glory of the
LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the
mouth of the LORD has spoken.”

This passage predicts the ministry of John the Baptist. This passage
hearkens back to the wilderness journey of Israel.

It emphasizes the need for faith perception of the truth. For us, it
looks forward to the coming of Christ, or our joining with him.

Read Isaiah 42. It establishes the purpose of the Messiah. "

These verses spell out the purpose of the life of Christ.

-   He will bring justice to the nations.

-   He will open the eyes that are blind.

-   He will set free the prisoners from the dungeon of the cosmic
    system.

The passage also confirms that these things are a part of the Divine
Decree in eternity past.

Read Isaiah 49, which records the call of the Messiah.

This call will result in the salvation of Israel, and of all mankind. It
will solve all problems, no matter how great. It will bring about the
millennium.

Isaiah 53 records the substitutionary spiritual death of Christ, a
priestly function.

Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the LORD
been revealed?

For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry
ground; he had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no
beauty that we should desire him.

He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted
with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised,
and we esteemed him not.

Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed
him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.

But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with
his stripes we are healed.

All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own
way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before
its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.

By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation,
who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living,
stricken for the transgression of my people?

And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his
death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his
mouth.

Yet it was the will of the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief;
when he makes himself an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring,
he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his
hand,

he shall see the fruit of the travail of his soul and be satisfied; by
his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be
accounted righteous; and he shall bear their iniquities.

Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall
divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to
death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of
many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

This is really important, because it records the purpose of the death of
the Messiah. He is to die a substitutionary spiritual death, one that
will pay for the sins of all mankind. It is a great sacrifice, and so
God gives Him a great destiny.

Jer 23:5-6, “Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “When I
shall raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king
and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land. In His days
Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely ; and this is His
name by which He will be called, the Lord our righteousness.”

Daniel 7:27, “Then the sovereignty, the dominion, and the greatness of
all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of
the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom will be an everlasting
kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.”

This is a passage which describes the eternal kingdom of God under the
rulership of Jesus Christ.

It tells of the gathering of all nations, human and angelic, and their
subordination to Christ at the Great White Throne.

Micah 5:2, “But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too little to be amon
the clans of Judah, from you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in
Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity.”

The eternal nature of Jesus Christ is set forth here. He is truly God.
Micah also identifies His birthplace - Bethlehem.

Zech 12:10, “And I will pour out on the house of David and on the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so
that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn
for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over
Him, like the bitter weeping over a first born.”

This is a little different. It records the crucifixion of Christ as it
relates to the Jews who demand His crucifixion. The Jews turned against
Christ, and demanded his death over that of Barabbas, a common criminal
who had participated in an insurrection against the Roman rule.

Malachi 3:1, “Behold, I am going to send My messenger, and he will clear
the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to
His temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight,
behold, He is coming,” says the Lord of hosts.

There are two predictions here. First, the prophet predicts the ministry
of John the Baptist. Second, there is a prediction concerning the
scouring of the Temple, which actually occurred on two occasions.

**King David, the Forerunner of Christ**

King David was the forerunner of Christ in at least three ways:

In his selection by Samuel the prophet.

In the establishment and administration of his kingdom.

In his fantastic relationship with God. The words of a man on his
deathbed reveal a lot about him. David, for all of his sin and tragedy
was a man of God.

Read 1 Samuel 16:1-13, “David the son of jesse declares, and the man who
was raised on high declares, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the
sweet psalmist of Israel, the Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and His
word was on my tongue. The Rock Israel spoke to me, He who rules over
men righteously, who rules in the fear of God, is as the light of the
morning when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, when the tender
grass springs out of the earth, through sunshine after rain. Truly is
not my house so with God? For He has made an everlasting covenant with
me, ordered in all things, and secured; for all my salvation and all my
desire, will He not indeed make it grow? But the worthless, every one of
them will be thrust away like thorns, because they cannot be taken in
hand; but the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the shaft
of a spear, and they will be compleely burned with fire in their place.”

David to the Exile

Joseph’s Line, the Legal Line of Christ (Matthew).

Solomon

Solomon was a true genius, and he exploited that genius by having a
great relationship with God. “Now God gave Solomon wisdom and very great
discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand that is on the seashore.
And Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east
and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men, than Ethan
the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame
was known in all the surrounding nations. He also spoke 3,000 proverbs,
and his songs were 1,005. And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is
in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he spoke also of
animals and birds and creeping things and fish. And men came from all
peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth
who had heard of his wisdom.”

Yet, Solomon became involved with the queen of Sheba, and his lust for
her nearly destroyed him. Toward the end of his life he wrote a
testimony to the folly of his lust. We have that testimony recorded in
the Bible - it is the book of Ecclesiastes.

“Futility of futilities! All is futility!” Is the tone of the book.

Solomon then proceeds to record all of his accomplishments, and all of
his doings, he says, added up to nothing.

His final conclusion was this: “The conclusion, when all has been heard,
is: fear God, and keep His commandments, because this applies to every
person. for God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is
hidden, whether it is good or evil.”

Rehoboam

The son of Solomon, he was a weak king, and although he wanted the right
things, he lacked the leadership to bring them about.

He wanted a unified kingdom, but the Northern kingdom of Israel split
from him.

He wanted the pure worship of God, but the entire nation rebelled and
conducted even the most depraved forms of idol worship.

He was an immoral man, and he had a knack for making bad decisions from
a position of weakness.

Abijah

Abijah saw the split of the two nations in a very black and white way.
The Northern kingdom had rebelled, and must be forcibly brought back
under the reign of one. That one, of course, was him.

He fought a great battle with Jeroboam, and though he won, he was unable
to bring the rebels under his rule. The kingdom remained divided.

Abijah was also an immoral man, and he too was a failure as a king.

Asa

Asa returned to the pure worship of God. Although he allowed idolatry to
exist, he emphasized what was true and right: the ritual plan of God.

Prosperity also returned to the southern kingdom. Many came down from
the north because in him they saw a renewal of David’s glory.

However, he did make a great mistake towards the end of his life.
Zealous to make the northern kingdom return to the rule of God, he
allied with a pagan nation, Syria.

Asa became ill and did not seek God’s help. Depending on his household
physicians, he died.

Jehoshaphat

This man, a king, was a winner. He sought the Lord with all his heart,
and he made his nation a good place. When his nation was threatened, he
turned the entire nation to God.

Read 2 Chron. 20.

Jehosaphat was benevolent and wise, and both his foreign and domestic
policies were effective. He lived out his life peacefully, satisfied
because of his great relationship with God.

Joram

Not much is known about this man, other than his father.

Uzziah

Uzziah was another great man, who followed the Lord for most of his
life. He grew to have a great relationship with God under the ministry
of the prophet Zechariah.

He had a great career as king, but he became proud, and in his pride he
overstepped the bounds of his authority and tried to perform a priestly
function. For that sin, God gave him leprosy, and he remained a leper
until the day of his death.

Jotham

Jotham was also a great king, and he turned out to be great even than
his father, for he did not become arrogant because of his success.

He died a contented man, confident before God of his eternal future.

The people were not completely responsive to his leadership, but Judah
still became much stronger through him.

Ahaz

This man was a loser. He refused to depend on God - refused to believe
in Him. He was instead an idolater, and as king he did many evil things.

He allied Judah with Assyria, and paid tribute to Tiglath-Pileser their
king, even sending him the Temple treasures.

When he died, no one missed him, and the people did not think him worthy
to be buried with the other kings of Israel.

Hezekiah

Hezekiah was a good and Godly king, who from his relationship with God
desired to repair the damage that his father had done.

The Assyrian menace was great during this time, and he did everything he
could to strengthen his own nation so that they might withstand the
enemy.

-   The first priority was spiritual and moral.

-   After that he saw to it that the economy and the army were greatly
    improved.

-   The Northern kingdom of Israel went out under the fifth cycle of
    discipline during his reign, and their destruction together with the
    Sunday school ministry of Isaiah served to bring the southern
    kingdom under the Divine standards once again.

Under his rule a great building program took place.

Hezekiah became deathly ill, and it looked like the end was near.
However, he had no heir at the time, and of course the line of Christ
was through him. He prayed for his own life, and trusted in God, and God
extended his life for another 15 years. It was during that time that he
fathered a son, Manasseh.

Manasseh

Manasseh ruled for fifty five years. His was the longest rule of any of
the kings of Judah. He was an extremely evil man, who hated God and his
Word.

The prophets prophesied against him, but he only persecuted them all the
more.

Because he was so evil, God sent the Assyrians against him, who captured
him and carted him off to Babylon.

This Divine discipline worked, because Manasseh repented, and removed
all the idols and idolatrous altars that he could.

Though he had been very evil, he died in peace, knowing the forgiveness
of his savior.

Amon

Unfortunately, Amon imitated all of the evil of his own father, and
failed to repent. He died the victim of a conspiracy, and his eight year
old son took the throne in his place.

Josiah

When Josiah had reigned for 12 years he began a great purge of all the
idol worship in the land. A few years later, he oversaw the cleansing
and repairing of the Temple. While the priests were doing this, they
discovered the book of the Law, and drew great conviction from it.

However, it was too late for the southern kingdom, and the wrath of God
was already unleashed.

Josiah died in peace before the destruction of the nation, and did not
have to witness the terrible invasion of the Babylonians.

Jehoiakim

Jehoiakim was an evil, idolatrous man who ruled as king during the
destruction of the nation of Judah.

He is not mentioned - Matthew skips over him because of his evil and the
terrible destruction that occurred during his reign

His son Jeconiah, or Jehoiachin is mentioned by Matthew.

**Mary’s Line, the Biological Line of Christ (Luke)**

Note: We are taking this one all the way to Christ.

Nathan

Nathan was a son of David and Bathsheba. He is the quiet son, for
nothing much is said about him in Scripture. Even so, he was a link in
the biological line of Christ.

Mattathia

Nothing much is known about this man.

Menna, Melea, Eliakim, Jonam, Joseph, Judah, Simeon, Levi, Matthat,
Jorim, Eliezer, Joshua, Er, Elmadam, Cosam, Addi, Melchi, Neri

Nothing is said about any of these men in the Bible.

Shealtiel

This is where a crossover point occurs. Both genealogies stop here. This
is where the nation went into exile. Shealtiel was not the true son of
Jeconiah, but instead, the line of David continued in this man because
Jeconiah failed to produce an heir. This is why Matthew’s genealogy
claims Jeconiah as this man’s father.

Zerubbabel

He is the head of Israel at the time of the return from exile. Zerubabel
is the result of the marriage between Pedaiah and the wife of Shealtiel.
Shealtiel died without leaving an heir, and so it was his brother’s
responsibility to step in for him.

1 Chron. 3:19 identifies Pedaiah as the true father, while Shealtiel was
only his wife’s first husband. The line continued.

According to the book of Ezra, this man was a key figure in the
rebuilding of the Temple He was a good man who did much for the worship
of the true God of Israel.

Rhesa, Joanan, Joda, Josech, Semein, Mattathias, Maath, Naggai, Hesli,
Nahum, Amos, Mattathias, Joseph, Jannai, Melchi, Levi, Matthat

The biological line of Christ continued in these men. Nothing else is
known of them.

Eli

Father of Mary.

Mary

From the Exile to Joseph Joseph’s Line, the Legal Line of Christ, as
Expounded in Matthew

**Shealtiel, Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Zadok, Achim, Eliud,
Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob**

**Joseph**, the husband of Mary and stepfather of Christ
