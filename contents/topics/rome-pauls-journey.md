The following is Chapter 24 of The Life and Epistles of St.
Paul, by W. J. Conybeare and J. S. Howson**

The Appian Way

The last Chapter began with a description of the facilities possessed by
the ancients for travelling by sea: this must begin with a reference to
their best opportunities of travelling by land. We have before spoken of
some of the most important roads through the provinces of the Empire:
now we are about to trace the Apostle’s footsteps along that road, which
was at once the oldest and most frequented in Italy, and which was
called, in comparison with all others, the “Queen of Roads.” We are no
longer following the narrow line of compact pavement across Macedonian
plains and mountains, or through the varied scenery in the interior of
Asia Minor: but we are on the most crowded approach to the metropolis of
the world, in the midst of prætors and proconsuls, embassies, legions,
and turms of horse, “to their provinces hasting or on return,” which
Milton,—in his description of the City enriched with the spoils of
nations,—has called us to behold “in various habits on the Appian road.”

Leaving then all consideration of Puteoli, as it was related to the sea
and to the various places on the coast, we proceed to consider its
communications by land with the towns of Campania and Latium. The great
line of communication between Rome and the southern part of the
peninsula was the Way constructed by Appius Claudius, which passed
through Capua , and thence to Brundusium on the shore of the Adriatic.
Puteoli and its neighbourhood lay some miles to the westward of this
main road: but communicated with it easily by well-travelled
cross-roads. One of them followed the coast from Puteoli northwards,
till it joined the Appian Way at Sinuessa, on the borders of Latium and
Campania. It appears, however, that this road was not constructed till
the reign of Domitian. Our attention, therefore, is called to the other
cross-road which led directly to Capua. One branch of it left the coast
at Cumæ, another at Puteoli. It was called the “Campanian Way,” and also
the “Consular Way.” It seems to have been constructed during the
Republic, and was doubtless the road which is mentioned, in an animated
passage of Horace’s Epistles, as communicating with the baths and villas
of Baiæ.

The first part then of the route which Julius took with his prisoners
was probably from Puteoli to Capua. All the region near the coast,
however transformed in the course of ages by the volcanic forces, which
are still at work, is recognised as the scene of the earliest Italian
mythology, and must ever be impressive from the poetic images, partly of
this world and partly of the next, with which Virgil has filled it. From
Cumæ to Capua, the road traverses a more prosaic district: the
“Phlegræan fields” are left behind, and we pass from the scene of
Italy’s dim mythology to the theatre of the most exciting passages of
her history. The whole line of the road can be traced at intervals, not
only in the close neighbourhood of Puteoli and Capua, but through the
intermediate villages, by fragments of pavement, tombs, and ancient
milestones.

Capua, after a time of disgrace had expiated its friendship with
Hannibal, was raised by Julius Cæsar to the rank of a colony: in the
reign of Augustus it had resumed all its former splendour: and about the
very time of which we are writing, it received accessions of dignity
from the Emperor Nero. It was the most important city on the whole line
of the Appian Way, between Rome and Brundusium. That part of the line
with which we are concerned, is the northerly and most ancient portion.
The distance is about 125 miles: and it may be naturally divided into
two equal parts. The division is appropriate, whether in regard to the
physical configuration of the country, or the modern political
boundaries. The point of division is where Terracina is built at the
base of those cliffs, on which the city of Anxur was of old proudly
situated, and where a narrow pass, between the mountain and the sea,
unites the Papal States to the kingdom of Naples.

The distance from Capua to Terracina is about seventy Roman miles. At
the third mile, the road crossed the river Vulturnus at Casilinum, a
town then falling into decay. Fifteen miles further it crossed the river
Savo, by what was then called the Campanian Bridge. Thence, after three
miles, it came to Sinuessa on the sea, which in St. Paul’s day was
reckoned the first town in Latium. But the old rich Campania extended
further to the northward, including the vine-clad hills of the famous
Falernian district through which we pass, after crossing the Savo. The
last of these hills (where the vines may be seen trained on elms, as of
old) is the range of Massicus, which stretches from the coast towards
the Apennines, and finally shuts out from the traveller, as he descends
on the farther side, all the prospect of Vesuvius and the coast near
Puteoli. At that season, both vines and elms would have a winterly
appearance. But the traces of spring would be visible in the willows;
among which the Liris flows in many silent windings—from the birthplace
of Marius in the mountains—to the city and the swamps by the sea, which
the ferocity of his mature life has rendered illustrious. After leaving
Minturnæ, the Appian Way passes on to another place, which has different
associations with the later years of the Republic. We speak of Formiæ,
with its long street by the shore of its beautiful bay, and with its
villas on the sea side and above it; among which was one of Cicero’s
favourite retreats from the turmoil of the political world, and where at
last he fell by the hand of assassins. Many a lectica, or palanquin,
such as that in which he was reclining when overtaken by his murderers,
may have been met by St. Paul in his progress,—with other carriages,
with which the road would become more and more crowded,—the cisium, or
light cabriolet, of some gay reveller, on his way to Baiæ,—or the
four-wheeled rheda, full of the family of some wealthy senator quitting
the town for the country. At no great distance from Formiæ the road left
the sea again, and passed, where the substructions of it still remain,
through the defiles of the Cæcuban hills, with their stony but
productive vineyards. Thence the traveller looked down upon the plain of
Fundi, which retreats like a bay into the mountains, with the low lake
of Amyclæ between the town and the sea. Through the capricious care,
with which time has preserved in one place what is lost in another, the
pavement of the ancient way is still the street of this, the most
northerly town of the Neapolitan kingdom in this direction. We have now
in front of us the mountain line, which is both the frontier of the
Papal states, and the natural division of the Apostle’s journey from
Capua to Rome. Where it reaches the coast, in bold limestone precipices,
there Anxur was situated, with its houses and temples high above the
sea.

After leaving Anxur, the traveller observes the high land retreating
again from the coast, and presently finds himself in a wide and
remarkable plain, enclosed towards the interior by the sweep of the blue
Volscian mountains, and separated by a belt of forest from the sea. Here
are the Pomptine marshes,—“the only marshes ever dignified by classic
celebrity.” The descriptive lines of the Roman satirist have wonderfully
concurred with the continued unhealthiness of the half-drained morass,
in preserving a living commentary on that fifteenth verse in the last
chapter of the Acts, which exhibits to us one of the most touching
passages in the Apostle’s life. A few miles beyond Terracina, where a
fountain, grateful to travellers, welled up near the sanctuary of
Feronia, was the termination of a canal, which was formed by Augustus
for the purpose of draining the marshes, and which continued for twenty
miles by the side of the road. Over this distance, travellers had their
choice, whether to proceed by barges dragged by mules, or on the
pavement of the way itself. It is impossible to know which plan was
adopted by Julius and his prisoners. If we suppose the former to have
been chosen, we have the aid of Horace’s Satire to enable us to imagine
the incidents and the company, in the midst of which the Apostle came,
unknown and unfriended, to the corrupt metropolis of the world. And yet
he was not so unfriended as he may possibly have thought himself that
day, in his progress from Anxur across the watery, unhealthy plain. On
the arrival of the party at Appii Forum, which was a town where the
mules were unfastened, at the other end of the canal, and is described
by the satirist as full of low tavern-keepers and bargemen,—at that
meeting-place where travellers from all parts of the Empire had often
crossed one another’s path,—on that day, in the motley and vulgar crowd,
some of the few Christians who were then in the world, suddenly
recognised one another, and emotions of holy joy and thanksgiving
sanctified the place of coarse vice and vulgar traffic. The disciples at
Rome had heard of the Apostle’s arrival at Puteoli, and hastened to meet
him on the way; and the prisoner was startled to recognise some of those
among whom he had laboured, and whom he had loved, in the distant cities
of the East. Whether Aquila and Priscilla were there it is needless to
speculate. Whoever might be the persons, they were brethren in Christ,
and their presence would be an instantaneous source of comfort and
strength. We have already seen, on other occasions of his life, how the
Apostle’s heart was lightened by the presence of his friends.

Appii Forum and the Three Taverns

About ten miles farther he received a second welcome from a similar
group of Christian brethren. Two independent companies had gone to meet
him; or the zeal and strength of one party had outstripped the other. At
a place called the Three Taverns, where a cross road from the coast at
Antium came in from the left, this second party of Christians was
waiting to welcome and to honour “the ambassador in bonds.” With a
lighter heart, and a more cheerful countenance, he travelled the
remaining seventeen miles, which brought him along the base of the Alban
Hills, in the midst of places well known and famous in early Roman
legends, to the town of Aricia. The Great Apostle had the sympathies of
human nature; he was dejected and encouraged by the same causes which
act on our spirits; he too saw all outward objects in “hues borrowed
from the heart.” The diminution of fatigue—the more hopeful prospect of
the future—the renewed elasticity of religious trust—the sense of a
brighter light on all the scenery round him—on the foliage which
overshadowed the road—on the wide expanse of the plain to the left—on
the high summit of the Alban Mount,—all this, and more than this, is
involved in St. Luke’s sentence,—“when Paul saw the brethren, he thanked
God, and took courage.”

The mention of the Alban Mount reminds us that we are approaching the
end of our journey. The isolated group of hills, which is called by this
collective name, stands between the plain which has just been traversed
and that other plain which is the Campagna of Rome. All the bases of the
mountain were then (as indeed they are partially now) clustered round
with the villas and gardens of wealthy citizens. The Appian Way climbs
and then descends along its southern slope. After passing Lanuvium it
crossed a crater-like valley on immense substructions, which still
remain. Here is Aricia, an easy stage from Rome. The town was above the
road; and on the hill side swarms of beggars beset travellers as they
passed. On the summit of the next rise, Paul of Tarsus would obtain his
first view of Rome. There is no doubt that the prospect was, in many
respects, very different from the view which is now obtained from the
same spot. It is true that the natural features of the scene are
unaltered. The long wall of blue Sabine mountains, with Soracte in the
distance, closed in the Campagna, which stretched far across to the sea
and round the base of the Alban hills. But ancient Rome was not, like
modern Rome, impressive from its solitude, standing alone, with its one
conspicuous cupola, in the midst of a desolate though beautiful waste.
St. Paul would see a vast city, covering the Campagna, and almost
continuously connected by its suburbs with the villas on the hill where
he stood, and with the bright towns which clustered on the sides of the
mountains opposite. Over all the intermediate space were the houses and
gardens, through which aqueducts and roads might be traced in converging
lines towards the confused mass of edifices which formed the city of
Rome. Here no conspicuous building, elevated above the rest, attracted
the eye or the imagination. Ancient Rome had neither cupola nor
campanile. Still less had it any of those spires, which give life to all
the landscapes of Northern Christendom. It was a wide-spread aggregate
of buildings, which, though separated by narrow streets and open
squares, appeared, when seen from near Aricia, blended into one
indiscriminate mass: for distance concealed the contrasts which divided
the crowded habitations of the poor and the dark haunts of filth and
misery—from the theatres and colonnades, the baths, the temples and
palaces with gilded roofs, flashing back the sun.

The road descended into the plain at Bovillæ, six miles from Aricia, and
thence it proceeded in a straight line, with the sepulchres of
illustrious families on either hand. One of these was the burial-place
of the Julian gens, with which the centurion who had charge of the
prisoners was in some way connected. As they proceeded over the old
pavement, among gardens and modern houses, and approached nearer the
busy metropolis—the “conflux issuing forth or entering in” in various
costumes and on various errands,— vehicles, horsemen, and
foot-passengers, soldiers and labourers, Romans and foreigners,—became
more crowded and confusing. The houses grew closer. They were already in
Rome. It was impossible to define the commencement of the city. Its
populous portions extended far beyond the limits marked out by Servius.
The ancient wall, with its once sacred pomœrium, was rather an object
for antiquarian interest, like the walls of York or Chester, than any
protection against the enemies, who were kept far aloof by the legions
on the frontier.

Entrance into Rome

Yet the Porta Capena is a spot which we can hardly leave without
lingering for a moment. Under this arch—which was perpetually dripping
with the water of the aqueduct that went over it—had passed all those
who, since a remote period of the republic, had travelled by the Appian
Way,—victorious generals with their legions, returning from foreign
service,—emperors and courtiers, vagrant representatives of every form
of Heathenism, Greeks and Asiatics, Jews and Christians. From this point
entering within the city, Julius and his prisoners moved on, with the
Aventine on their left, close round the base of the Cœlian, and through
the hollow ground which lay between this hill and the Palatine: thence
over the low ridge called Velia, where afterwards was built the arch of
Titus, to commemorate the destruction of Jerusalem; and then descending,
by the Sacra Via, into that space which was the centre of imperial power
and imperial magnificence, and associated also with the most glorious
recollections of the republic. The Forum was to Rome, what the Acropolis
was to Athens, the heart of all the characteristic interest of the
place. Here was the Milliarium Aureum, to which the roads of all the
provinces converged. All around were the stately buildings, which were
raised in the closing years of the Republic, and by the earlier
Emperors. In front was the Capitoline Hill, illustrious long before the
invasion of the Gauls. Close on the left, covering that hill, whose name
is associated in every modern European language with the notion of
imperial splendour, were the vast ranges of the palace—the “house of
Cæsar” (Phil. 4:22). Here were the household troops quartered in a
prœtorium attached to the palace. And here (unless, indeed, it was in
the great Prœtorian camp outside the city wall) Julius gave up his
prisoner to Burrus, the Prœtorian Prœfect, whose official duty it was to
keep in custody all accused persons who were to be tried before the
Emperor.

This doubt, which of two places, somewhat distant from each other, was
the scene of St. Paul’s meeting with the commander-in-chief of the
Prætorian guards, gives us the occasion for entering on a general
description of the different parts of the city of Rome. It would be
nugatory to lay great stress, as is too often done, on its “seven
hills:” for a great city at length obliterates the original features of
the ground, especially where those features were naturally not very
strongly marked. The description, which is easy in reference to Athens
or Edinburgh, is hard in the instance of modern London or ancient Rome.
Nor is it easy, in the case of one of the larger cities of the world, to
draw any marked lines of distinction among the different classes of
buildings. It is true, the contrasts are really great; but details are
lost in a distant view of so vast an aggregate. The two scourges to
which ancient Rome was most exposed, revealed very palpably the
contrast, both of the natural ground and the human structures, which by
the general observer might be unnoticed or forgotten. When the Tiber was
flooded, and the muddy waters converted all the streets and open places
of the lower part of the city into lakes and canals, it would be seen
very clearly how much lower were the Forum and the Campus Martius, than
those three detached hills (the Capitoline, the Palatine, and the
Aventine) which rose near the river; and those four ridges (the Cœlian,
the Esquiline, the Viminal, and the Quirinal) which ascended and united
together in the higher ground on which the Prætorian camp was situated.
And when fires swept rapidly from roof to roof, and vast ranges of
buildings were buried in the ruins of one night, that contrast between
the dwellings of the poor and the palaces of the rich, which has
supplied the Apostle with one of his most forcible images, would be
clearly revealed,—the difference between structures of “sumptuous
marbles, with silver and gold,” which abide after the fire, and the
hovels of “wood, hay, stubble,” which are burnt (1 Cor. 3:10–15).

Description of Rome

If we look at a map of modern Rome, with a desire of realising to
ourselves the appearance of the city of Augustus and Nero, we must in
the first place obliterate from our view that circuit of walls, which is
due in various proportions, to Aurelian, Belisarius, and Pope Leo IV.
The wall, through which the Porta Capena gave admission, was the old
Servian enclosure, which embraced a much smaller area: though we must
bear in mind, as we have remarked above, that the city had extended
itself beyond this limit, and spread through various suburbs, far into
the country. In the next place we must observe that the hilly part of
Rome, which is now half occupied by gardens, was then the most populous,
while the Campus Martius, now covered with crowded streets, was
comparatively open. It was only about the close of the Republic that
many buildings were raised on the Campus Martius, and these were chiefly
of a public or decorative character. One of these, the Pantheon, still
remains, as a monument of the reign of Augustus. This, indeed, is the
period from which we must trace the beginning of all the grandeur of
Roman buildings. Till the Civil War between Pompey and Cæsar, the
private houses of the citizens had been mean, and the only public
structures of note were the cloacæ and the aqueducts. But in proportion
as the ancient fabric of the constitution broke down, and while
successful generals brought home wealth from provinces conquered and
plundered on every shore of the Mediterranean, the City began to assume
the appearance of a new and imperial magnificence. To leave out of view
the luxurious and splendid residences which wealthy citizens raised for
their own uses, Pompey erected the first theatre of stone, and Julius
Cæsar surrounded the great Circus with a portico. From this time the
change went on rapidly and incessantly. The increase of public business
led to the erection of enormous Basilicas. The Forum was embellished on
all sides. The Temple of Apollo on the Palatine, and those other temples
the remains of which are still conspicuous at the base of the
Capitoline, were only a small part of similar buildings raised by
Augustus. The triumphal arch erected by Tiberius near the same place was
only one of many structures, which rose in rapid succession to decorate
that busy neighbourhood. And if we wish to take a wider view, we have
only to think of the aqueducts, which were built, one by one, between
the private enterprises of Agrippa in the reign of Augustus, and the
recent structures of the Emperor Claudius, just before the arrival of
the Apostle Paul. We may not go further in the order of chronology. We
must remember that the Colosseum, the Basilica of Constantine, and the
baths of other emperors, and many other buildings which are now regarded
as the conspicuous features of ancient Rome, did not then exist. We are
describing a period which is anterior to the time of Nero’s fire. Even
after the opportunity which that calamity afforded for reconstructing
the city, Juvenal complains of the narrowness of the streets. Were we to
attempt to extend our description to any of these streets,—whether the
old Vicus Tuscus, with its cheating shopkeepers, which led round the
base of the Palatine, from the Forum to the Circus,—or the aristocratic
Carinæ along the slope of the Esquiline,—or the noisy Suburra, in the
hollow between the Viminal and Quirinal, which had sunk into disrepute,
though once the residence of Julius Cæsar,—we should only wander into
endless perplexity. And we should be equally lost, if we were to attempt
to discriminate the mixed multitude, which were crowded on the various
landings of those insulœ, or piles of lodging houses, which are perhaps
best described by comparing them to the houses in the old town of
Edinburgh.

If it is difficult to describe the outward appearances of the city, it
is still more difficult to trace the distinctive features of all the
parts of that colossal population which filled it. Within a circuit of
little more than twelve miles more than two millions of inhabitants were
crowded. It is evident that this fact is only explicable by the
narrowness of the streets, with that peculiarity of the houses which has
been alluded to above. In this prodigious collection of human beings,
there were of course all the contrasts which are seen in a modern
city,—all the painful lines of separation between luxury and squalor,
wealth and want. But in Rome all these differences were on an
exaggerated scale, and the institution of slavery modified further all
social relations. The free citizens were more than a million: of these,
the senators were so few in number, as to be hardly appreciable: the
knights, who filled a great proportion of the public offices, were not
more than 10,000: the troops quartered in the city may be reckoned at
15,000: the rest were the Plebs urbana. That a vast number of these
would be poor, is an obvious result of the most ordinary causes. But, in
ancient Rome, the luxury of the wealthier classes did not produce a
general diffusion of trade, as it does in a modern city. The handicraft
employments, and many of what we should call professions, were in the
hands of slaves; and the consequence was, that a vast proportion of the
Plebs urbana lived on public or private charity. Yet were these pauper
citizens proud of their citizenship, though many of them had no better
sleeping-place for the night than the public porticos or the vestibules
of temples. They cared for nothing beyond bread for the day, the games
of the Circus, and the savage delight of gladiatorial shows.
Manufactures and trade they regarded as the business of the slave and
the foreigner. The number of the slaves was perhaps about a million. The
number of the strangers or peregrini was much smaller; but it is
impossible to describe their varieties. Every kind of nationality and
religion found its representative in Rome. But it is needless to pursue
these details. The most obvious comparison is better than an elaborate
description. Rome was like London with all its miseries, vices, and
follies exaggerated, and without Christianity.

Population of Rome

One part of Rome still remains to be described, the “Trastevere,” or
district beyond the river. This portion of the city has been known in
modern times for the energetic and intractable character of its
population. In earlier times it was equally notorious, though not quite
for the same reason. It was the residence of a low rabble, and the place
of the meanest merchandise. There is, however, one reason why our
attention is particularly called to it. It was the ordinary residence of
the Jews—the “Ghetto” of ancient Rome: and great part of it was
doubtless squalid and miserable, like the Ghetto of modern Rome, though
the Jews were often less oppressed under the Cæsars than under the
Popes. Here then—on the level ground, between the windings of the muddy
river and the base of that hill from the brow of which Porsena looked
down on early Rome, and where the French within these few years have
planted their cannon—we must place the home of those Israelitish
families among whom the Gospel bore its first-fruits in the metropolis
of the world: and it was on these bridges,—which formed an immediate
communication from the district beyond the Tiber to the Emperor’s
household and the guards on the Palatine,—that those despised Jewish
beggars took their stand, to whom in the place of their exile had come
the hopes of a better citizenship than that which they had lost.

The Jewish community thus established in Rome, had its first beginnings
in the captives brought by Pompey after his eastern campaign. Many of
them were manumitted; and thus a great proportion of the Jews in Rome
were freedmen. Frequent accessions to their numbers were made as years
went on—chiefly from the mercantile relations which subsisted between
Rome and the East. Many of them were wealthy, and large sums were sent
annually for religious purposes from Italy to the mother country. Even
the proselytes contributed to these sacred funds. It is difficult to
estimate the amount of the religious influence exerted by the Roman Jews
upon the various Heathens around them; but all our sources of
information lead us to conclude that it was very considerable. So long
as this influence was purely religious, we have no reason to suppose
that any persecution from the civil power resulted. It was when
commotions took place in consequence of expectations of a temporal
Messiah, or when vague suspicions of this mysterious people were more
than usually excited, that the Jews of Rome were cruelly treated, or
peremptorily banished. Yet from all these cruelties they recovered with
elastic force, and from all these exiles they returned; and in the early
years of Nero, which were distinguished for a mild and lenient
government of the Empire, the Jews in Rome seem to have enjoyed complete
toleration, and to have been a numerous, wealthy, and influential
community.

The Roman Church

The Christians doubtless shared the protection which was extended to the
Jews. They were hardly yet sufficiently distinguished as a self-existent
community, to provoke any independent hostility. It is even possible
that the Christians, so far as they were known as separate, were more
tolerated than the Jews; for, not having the same expectation of an
earthly hero to deliver them, they had no political ends in view, and
would not be in the same danger of exciting the suspicion of the
government. Yet we should fall into a serious error, if we were to
suppose that all the Christians in Rome, or the majority of them, had
formerly been Jews or Proselytes; though this was doubtless true of its
earliest members, who may have been of the number that were dispersed
after the first Pentecost, or, possibly, disciples of our Lord Himself.
It is impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion concerning the
first origin and early growth of the Church in Rome; though, from the
manifold links between the city and the provinces, it is easy to account
for the formation of a large and flourishing community. Its history
before the year 61 might be divided into three periods, separated from
each other by the banishment of the Jews from Rome in the reign of
Claudius, and the writing of St. Paul’s letter from Corinth. Even in the
first of these periods there might be points of connection between the
Roman Church and St. Paul; for some of those whom he salutes (Rom. 16:7,
11) as “kinsmen,” are also said to have been “Christians before him.” In
the second period it cannot well be doubted that a very close connection
began between St. Paul and some of the conspicuous members and principal
teachers of the Roman Church. The expulsion of the Jews in consequence
of the edict of Claudius, brought them in large numbers to the chief
towns of the Levant; and there St. Paul met them in the synagogues. We
have seen what results followed from his meeting with Aquila and
Priscilla at Corinth. They returned to Rome with all the stores of
spiritual instruction which he had given them; and in the Epistle to the
Romans we find him, as is natural, saluting them thus:—“Greet Priscilla
and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus: who have for my sake laid down
their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the
Churches of the Gentiles. Likewise greet the Church that is in their
house.” All this reveals to us a great amount of devoted exertion on
behalf of one large congregation in Rome; and all of it distinctly
connected with St. Paul. And this is perhaps only a specimen of other
cases of the like kind. Thus he sends a greeting to Epænetus, whom he
names “the first-fruits of Asia” (ver. 5), and who may have had the same
close relation to him during his long ministration at Ephesus (Acts,
19), which Aquila and Priscilla had at Corinth. Nor must we forget those
women, whom he singles out for special mention,—“Mary, who bestowed much
labour on him” (ver. 6); “the beloved Persis, who laboured much in the
Lord” (ver. 12); with Tryphæna and Tryphosa, and the unknown mother of
Rufus (ver. 13). We cannot doubt, that, though the Church of Rome may
have received its growth and instruction through various channels, many
of them were connected, directly or indirectly, with St. Paul; and
accordingly he writes, in the whole of the letter, as one already in
intimate relation with a Church which he has never seen. And whatever
bonds subsisted between this Apostle and the Roman Christians, must have
been drawn still closer when the letter had been received; for from that
time they were looking forward to a personal visit from him, in his
projected journey to the West. Thenceforward they must have taken the
deepest interest in all his movements, and received with eager anxiety
the news of his imprisonment at Cæsarea, and waited (as we have already
seen) for his arrival in Italy. It is indeed but too true that there
were parties among the Christians in Rome, and that some had a hostile
feeling against St. Paul himself; yet it is probable that the animosity
of the Judaizers was less developed, than it was in those regions which
he had personally visited, and to which they had actually followed him.
As to the unconverted Jews, the name of St. Paul was doubtless known to
them; yet were they comparatively little interested in his movements.
Their proud contempt of the Christian heresy would make them
indifferent. The leaven of the Gospel was working around them to an
extent of which they were hardly aware. The very magnitude of the
population of Rome had a tendency to neutralise the currents of party
feeling. For these reasons the hostility of the Jews was probably less
violent than in any other part of the Empire.

Interview with the Jews

Yet St. Paul could not possibly be aware of the exact extent of their
enmity against himself. Independently, therefore, of his general
principle of preaching, first to the Jew and then to the Gentile, he had
an additional reason for losing no time in addressing himself to his
countrymen. Thus, after the mention of St. Paul’s being delivered up to
Burrus, and allowed by him to be separate from the other prisoners, the
next scene to which the sacred historian introduces us is among the
Jews. After three days he sent for the principal men among them to his
lodging, and endeavoured to conciliate their feelings towards himself
and the Gospel.

It was highly probable that the prejudices of these Roman Jews were
already roused against the Apostle of the Gentiles; or if they had not
yet conceived an unfavourable opinion of him, there was a danger that
they would now look upon him as a traitor to his country, from the mere
fact that he had appealed to the Roman power. He might even have been
represented to them in the odious light of one who had come to Rome as
an accuser of the Sanhedrin before the Emperor. St. Paul, therefore,
addressed his auditors on this point at once, and shewed that his
enemies were guilty of this very appeal to the foreign power, of which
he had himself been suspected. He had committed no offence against the
holy nation, or the customs of their fathers; yet his enemies at
Jerusalem had delivered him,—one of their brethren—of the seed of
Abraham—of the tribe of Benjamin—a Hebrew of the Hebrews—into the hands
of the Romans. So unfounded was the accusation, that even the Roman
governor had been ready to liberate the prisoner; but his Jewish enemies
opposed his liberation. They strove to keep a child of Israel in Roman
chains. So that he was compelled, as his only hope of safety, to appeal
unto Cæsar. He brought no accusation against his countrymen before the
tribunal of the stranger: that was the deed of his antagonists. In fact,
his only crime had been his firm faith in God’s deliverance of his
people through the Messiah promised by the Prophets. “For the hope of
Israel,” he concluded, “I am bound with this chain.”

Their answer to this address was reassuring. They said that they had
received no written communication from Judæa concerning St. Paul, and
that none of “the brethren” who had arrived from the East had spoken any
evil of him. They further expressed a wish to hear from himself a
statement of his religious sentiments, adding that the Christian sect
was everywhere spoken against. There was perhaps something hardly honest
in this answer; for it seems to imply a greater ignorance with regard to
Christianity than we can suppose to have prevailed among the Roman Jews.
But with regard to Paul himself, it might well be true that they had
little information concerning him. Though he had been imprisoned long at
Cæsarea, his appeal had been made only a short time before winter. After
that time (to use the popular expression), the sea was shut; and the
winter had been a stormy one; so that it was natural enough that his
case should be first made known to the Jews by himself. All these
circumstances gave a favourable opening for the preaching of the Gospel,
and Paul hastened to take advantage of it. A day was fixed for a meeting
at his own private lodging.

They came in great numbers at the appointed time. Then followed an
impressive scene, like that at Troas (Acts, 21)—the Apostle pleading
long and earnestly,—bearing testimony concerning the kingdom of God,—and
endeavouring to persuade them by arguments drawn from their own
Scriptures,—“from morning till evening.” The result was a division among
the auditors—“not peace but a sword,”—the division which has resulted
ever since, when the Truth of God has encountered, side by side, earnest
conviction with worldly indifference, honest investigation with bigoted
prejudice, trustful faith with the pride of scepticism. After a long and
stormy discussion, the unbelieving portion departed; but not until St.
Paul had warned them, in one last address, that they were bringing upon
themselves that awful doom of judicial blindness, which was denounced in
their own Scriptures against obstinate unbelievers; that the salvation
which they rejected would be withdrawn from them, and the inheritance
they renounced would be given to the Gentiles. The sentence with which
he gave emphasis to this warning was that passage in Isaiah, which is
more often quoted in the New Testament than any other words from the
Old, —which recurring thus with solemn force at the very close of the
Apostolic history, seems to bring very strikingly together the Old
Dispensation and the New, and to connect the ministry of Our Lord with
that of His Apostles:— “Go unto this people and say: Hearing ye shall
hear and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see and shall not
perceive: for the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears
are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should
see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their
heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.”

A formal separation was now made between the Apostle of the Gentiles and
the Jews of Rome. They withdrew, to dispute concerning the “sect” which
was making such inroads on their prejudices (ver. 29). He remained in
his own hired house, where the indulgence of Burrus permitted him to
reside, instead of confining him within the walls of the Prætorian
barrack. We must not forget, however, that he was still a prisoner under
military custody,—chained by the arm, both day and night, to one of the
imperial bodyguard,—and thus subjected to the rudeness and caprice of an
insolent soldiery. This severity, however, was indispensable, according
to the Roman law; and he received every indulgence which it was in the
power of the Præfect to grant. He was allowed to receive all who came to
him (ver. 30), and was permitted, without hindrance, to preach boldly
the kingdom of God, and teach the things of the Lord Jesus Christ (ver.
31).

Thus was fulfilled his long cherished desire “to proclaim the Gospel to
them that were in Rome also” (Rom. 1:15). Thus ends the Apostolic
History, so far as it has been directly revealed. Here the thread of
sacred narrative, which we have followed so long, is suddenly broken.
Our knowledge of the incidents of his residence in Rome, and of his
subsequent history, must be gathered almost exclusively from the letters
of the Apostle himself.
