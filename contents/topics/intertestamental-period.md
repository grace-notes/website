<sup>Inter-Testamental\\ Period</sup>

Intertestamental Period
=======================

I. Definition
=============

The intertestamental period denotes here the history of postexilic
Judaism from the time of the completion of the book of Malachi to the
destruction of the temple of Jerusalem (a.d. 70). The period is
characterized by the struggle of the Jews in Palestine to attain
political and religious autonomy from a series of dominant foreign
powers, by the emergence of different movements within Judaism (*see*
Dispersion; Essenes; Sadducees; Zealot), by the process of hellenization
carried on by the Macedonians and Romans, and finally by the emergence
of Christianity.

Intertestamental Judaism was characterized, not by a continuing stream
of OT prophecy, but by the interpretation of prophecy and revelation
already given — the correct exposition and application of the OT to all
areas of life. The Jews were aware of the cessation of prophecy.
Josephus postulated the reign of Artaxerxes I — the Ahasuerus of the
book of Esther (465–424 b.c.) — as the time when prophecy ceased (CAp
i.8 [41]). This date concurs with the Mishnah (*Aboth* i.1), which names
the men of the Great Synagogue — the scribes of Ezra’s time — as the
successors of the prophets (cf. 1 Macc. 4:46; 9:27; 14:41).

The OT canon probably closed before 400 b.c., though some scholars
reject this position, postulating later dates for Joel, Jonah, and other
OT books. In particular, Daniel is often considered a pseudepigraphon
written after 167 b.c. But the appearance of fragments of the book of
Daniel at Qumrân that are related paleographically to 1Qisaa argues for
a date earlier than the Maccabean period (*see* Aramaic III; Canon of
the OT; Daniel, Book of VI). By a.d. 70 the formation of the NT canon
was well underway and Judaism and Christianity had parted company.

II. World History
=================

Persia and Greece were the dominant powers at the beginning of this
period. Cyrus had founded the Persian dynasty (559–530 b.c.) and was
succeeded in turn by Cambyses (530–522), Darius I (522–486), Xerxes I
(486–465), and Artaxerxes I (465–424). Cambyses conquered Egypt in 525,
but later attempts to extend rule over the Greek world failed when the
Persians were defeated at Marathon (490), Salamis (480), and Plataea.
Artaxerxes I was assassinated in 424 and Darius II ascended the throne.

A situation developed in which Persia attempted to play off the Greek
city-states, especially Athens and Sparta, against each other.
Infighting and intrigue, however, were also characteristic of Persian
politics. Darius II sent his son Cyrus II to Sardis with instructions to
give increased help to Sparta. While on this mission, however, Cyrus
began collecting Greek mercenaries to further his own plans. In 403
Artaxerxes II, brother of Cyrus, ascended the throne. Cyrus soon
attacked his brother’s forces at Cunaxa and was defeated (401). The
retreat of Cyrus’s Greek mercenaries is described in Xenophon’s
*Anabasis*; most of them eventually joined the Spartans.

Egypt threw off Persian control and began its 30th Dynasty (380). The
forces of Artaxerxes II, with the help of Greek mercenaries, attempted
to reassert Persian rule in 373, but with mixed success. Artaxerxes III
led a second attack in 343 that was victorious, terminating the rule of
the pharaohs. The Persian Empire, however, was in a state of
disintegration, with continual rebellions in the various satrapies.
Artaxerxes III attempted to reorganize the Persian government when he
came to the throne (358).

The rise of Macedonia was on the horizon. Philip II of Macedon
(359–336), father of Alexander, first conquered the Greek cities of
Pydna, Methone, and Amphipolis. He then incorporated into his alliance
Thrace, Chalcidice, and Thessaly. The economy of this alliance,
supplemented by mines at Pangaeum, enabled him to support a large
standing army, which became the army of his son Alexander.

While attending the wedding feast of his daughter, Philip was murdered
(336), and Alexander, age twenty, was elected as his father’s successor.
He crushed a revolt by Thebes (335) and began his assault against the
Persians, defeating them first at the battle of Granicus (334). He met
Darius III in battle at the river Issus (333) and defeated him,
capturing his family. Alexander then moved to the south, conquering Tyre
after a long siege (333/2) and arriving in Egypt in 332. He began the
process of hellenization in the Near East by founding Alexandria, his
largest colony. After leaving Egypt, Alexander defeated a vast army led
by Darius, and thus became master of the Persian Empire. He penetrated
as far east as India and then returned to Babylon, where he developed a
fever and died (323).

Alexander’s empire was divided among his generals, the *Diadochoi*
(“successors”): Ptolemy (Egypt); Seleucus (Babylon and Syria); Antipater
and his son Cassander (Macedonia and Greece); Antigonus (Phrygia and
parts of Asia Minor), Lysimachus (Thrace and Pergamum); Eumanes
(Pontus). A power struggle developed among them as they attempted to
develop their own dynasties.

Palestine assumed the role of a buffer state between the domains of
Ptolemy and Antigonus as it had centuries earlier between Egypt and
Assyria. First Palestine was under Ptolemaic rule (320–198), but a
Seleucid victory at Panion (200) began the period of Seleucid rule which
lasted until the end of the Maccabean revolt when the Seleucid king
Demetrius II granted Jewish independence and freedom from tribute (142).
Antiochus IV tried unsuccessfully to reimpose tribute but his death in
128 brought a final end to the Seleucid dynasty.

The Jews enjoyed relative independence until 64, when Pompey annexed
Syria as a province of Rome. Pompey proceeded to Jerusalem in 63 and the
Jews came under Roman rule, losing their political independence until
modern times. Pompey was killed in a civil clash with Julius Caesar
(48), and shortly thereafter Caesar was assassinated (44). Octavian
succeeded Caesar and defeated the rival forces of Mark Antony and
Cleopatra at Actium (31). Tiberius succeeded Augustus (Octavian), and
Caligula, Claudius, and Nero were emperors in turn. Nero, reigning from
a.d. 54 to 68, initiated the persecution of Christians by the Roman
state. Vespasian (69–79) succeeded Nero, and under his direction Titus
conquered Jerusalem (70) and crushed Jewish resistance at Masada, ending
the First Jewish Revolt. The final attempt by the Jews to throw off
Roman rule was the Bar Cochba revolt during the reign of Hadrian
(117–138), also unsuccessful (see H. E. L. Mellersh, *Chronology of the
Ancient World* [1976], pp. 96–326).

The process of hellenization initiated by Alexander and continued later
by the Romans was of central importance in this period. Its basis was
the Greek practice of colonization, already current in classical times.
In the Hellenistic period, soldiers were needed in distant areas under
Greek control. Land was given to soldiers in return for military
service, and this obligation passed to the occupant of the property in
succeeding generations. By this method, a Greek population was attracted
to cities of strategic or economic importance. Alexandria was
Alexander’s first and greatest colony, a trading and administrative
center. Other cities developed by colonization included Ephesus, founded
by Ionian colonists in the classical period; Corinth, refounded by the
Romans as a colony in 44 b.c. after its destruction in 146; and
Philippi, subject to colonization by Alexander’s father Philip in 356
and later by Antony and Augustus.

Such colonization brought with it the Greek language, Greek standards of
weights and measures, coinage, and the gymnasium (Gk *gymnásion*), which
was a public facility for sports that also provided instruction in
philosophy, literature, and music (see Hengel, I, 6–88; *Oxford
Classical Dictionary,* sv “Colonization, Hellenistic” [A. T. Griffith],
“Education” [F. A. G. Beck]).

III. Jewish History
===================

The rebuilding of the temple, completed in 516 b.c., was followed in the
next century by the reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah. It is generally agreed
that Nehemiah restored the walls of Jerusalem (444), stayed for twelve
years, and then returned from Susa after a brief absence (ca 430; Neh.
13:6f). Ezra came to Jerusalem in 457, the seventh year of Artaxerxes I
(Ezr. 7:1, 8), and collaborated with Nehemiah in 444 (Neh. 8:1). (For
another view *see* Ezra; Jerusalem III.F.1.) During this period, Malachi
condemned the sins of an unrepentant nation and a corrupt priesthood,
though a small remnant continued to follow in the footsteps of Ezra and
Nehemiah (Mal. 3:16f).

In Palestine during this obscure period the Jews and Samaritans became
religiously and ethnically separated, a fact reflected in the Gospel
narrative and still quaintly perpetuated by the contemporary Samaritan
high priest at Nâblus. Earlier, Aramaic began to replace Hebrew as the
vernacular. This development is discernible even within the canon,
notably in the book of Daniel. From Alexander the Great onward, Judaism
became increasingly threatened by the cultural forces of a highly
intellectual Hellenism, both in Palestine and the Diaspora. Jewish
resistance to such hellenization often explains the vast bulk of
intertestamental literature, much of it valuable and fine, none of it
canonical. The discerning reader perceives that divine guidance kept the
right books within the compass of Scripture. Eventually, and gradually,
Judaism manifested itself in the “Three Pillars of Judaism”: the
tripartite OT canon of Law, Prophets, and Writings; the synagogue, with
its new, liturgical, and entirely nonsacrificial worship; and Rabbinism,
which culminated in the Talmud and Midrash.

The Jerusalem temple and priesthood were corrupt in Malachi’s day, but
when Antiochus IV Epiphanes came to the Syrian throne in 175 b.c. their
apostasy and deliberate policy of hellenization were even more
notorious. The new monarch (nicknamed Epimanes, “the madman”), in a
policy of forced hellenization, overestimated the extent to which he
could insult the seemingly decadent Jewish religion; and in view of its
official representatives, one cannot entirely blame him. From the still
faithful remnant was sparked off the celebrated Maccabean revolt, led in
turn by Mattathias, Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan, and Simon (168–135 b.c.)
(*see* Maccabees). Daniel’s “abomination of desolation” was proximately
and typically fulfilled in the erection by Antiochus Epiphanes (168) of
an altar to the Olympian Zeus in the very temple of God, an action that
fired the immediate revolt of Mattathias.

By their revolt, God’s chosen people slowly regained a precious if
transitory freedom. This liberation culminated under Simon in 142 b.c.,
when they gained exemption from the taxes, virtually from the
overlordship, of the Seleucids (1 Macc. 13:41f). In gratitude to the
deliverer, but in violation of the scriptural requirements of direct
hereditary succession, the high priesthood, now Hasmonean, became
invested and ratified in the person of Simon in 140. This break with
tradition, however, was never wholly acceptable to the pious and
orthodox, and it was a cause of later frictions. Simon’s life ended
tragically; he was murdered in 134 by his son-in-law, an ambitious
hellenizer. But his son John Hyrcanus, another intended victim, escaped
and became his successor (*see* Hasideans; Hasmoneans).

During the long dominion of John Hyrcanus (134–104), who was virtually
king as well as high priest, the Pharisaic and Sadducean parties became
clearly differentiated, with their respective legal and priestly
emphases. John abruptly transferred his allegiance from the first to the
second. We have seen already that his high priesthood was not entirely
satisfactory to the orthodox; neither was his kingship, so far as
monarchy could be acceptable at all in a theocratic and covenant
community, for he was not of the house and lineage of David. The quarrel
with the Pharisees probably flared up on these grounds. There followed
the brief reign of Aristobulus I, and the lengthy one of Alexander
Janneus (102–76). Alexander, able and successful in many political
respects, entirely alienated the Pharisees by his obvious personal
unfitness for the high priesthood. Pelted with citrons by the common
people for a technical and ritual mistake, he retaliated with defiance
and massacre (Josephus Ant. xiii.13.5 [372-76]). At the close of his
life, he counseled his queen and successor Alexandra Salome to make
peace with the Pharisees. This she did, according them increased powers
in the Sanhedrin, which they retained right into NT days (*Ant.*
xiii–16.1 [405]). Her son Aristobulus usurped the place and power of his
older brother Hyrcanus and reigned till 63 b.c. Then Pompey intervened,
and Palestine, shorn of its recent conquests, was integrated into the
Roman province of Syria.

The first phase of Roman domination in Palestine extended from 63 till
37, and then as later the Jews were uneasy under the yoke. Pompey
entered the holy of holies in 63, though he seems merely to have looked
around, and Crassus, proconsul of Syria, plundered the temple treasury
in 54 (*Ant.* xiv.4.4 [72]; 7.1 [105–109]). During most of this period
Hyrcanus II, a pitifully ineffective puppet, held nominal rule, civil
and ecclesiastical. Freed from his younger brother, yet now subject to
the Roman governor, he tended to delegate such real power as he
possessed to the Idumean Antipater, whose Edomite origins gave the
deepest offense to Jewish sentiment. The incumbency of Hyrcanus ended
pathetically after more than twenty years, when his intending successor
Antigonus confined him in bonds and then bit deeply into his ears,
thereby rendering him ritually unfit for office (Josephus BJ i.13.9
[270]). Antigonus himself did not last very long, and with him the
Hasmonean line came to its end. Herod, a son of Antipater and therefore
also of Edomite blood, secured the backing of Rome in 40 b.c., and was
able three years later to consolidate his kingship over a torn and
troubled Palestine. During his rivalry with Antigonus he had used and
equipped the fortress of Masada W of the Dead Sea.

Herod, rightly or wrongly styled “the Great,” was capable, loyal to
Rome, and reasonably successful in his control of Palestine. But his
political leanings, his Idumean blood, and his ten wives did not commend
him to Jewish subjects. He rebuilt in lavish manner the Jerusalem
temple, but the heathen sanctuaries that were also indebted to his
munificence suggest religious views mixed or skeptical. Filson (p. 22)
sums him up by remarking trenchantly, “He preserved order almost
everywhere except in his polygamous palace.” Since Herod features
prominently in the Matthaean Infancy narratives, his death in 4 b.c.
gives a date before which Jesus must have been born. The domains granted
to his sons, the various Roman procuratorships in Palestine, in short,
the general affairs of relevant history down to about the mid-60’s a.d.,
are well known and need not be recapitulated here.

About a.d. 66, warned by such predictions as Mk. 13:14, the Christians
in Jerusalem fled to Pella. This was the beginning — perhaps effectively
the end — of the split between Church and synagogue. The prolonged siege
of Jerusalem by Titus followed, culminating in a.d. 70 in the butchery
of Jews in the Holy City, and in the total ruin of the cherished temple,
even as Christ had predicted (Mk. 13:2).

The conquest of Titus was virtually final, but there were pockets of
resistance. Nine hundred sixty Jewish men, women, and children gathered
on the summit of the old Herodian fortress of Masada; on the east side
was a sheer drop of about 400 m (1300 ft) to the Dead Sea. From here
they defied, almost successfully, the embattled might of Rome. Flavius
Silva and his men nearly retired in frustration and defeat. But wind,
fire, and catapult stones at last smashed the Jewish defenses; and the
conquering legions proudly mounted the high platform, only to find that
the defenders had committed suicide. Yigael Yadin, with others,
uncovered the skeletons of these people in the 1960’s; he aptly calls
them an “undying symbol of desperate courage” (EAEHL, III, 806, 810f).

Outside of Jerusalem, Judaism assumed slightly different forms. The
Qumrân community, associated by some scholars with the Essenes, carried
on its own kind of scriptural exegesis and religious practice with the
belief that they were a righteous remnant living in the last days. Large
numbers of Jews made up the Dispersion (Gk *diasporá*), i.e., those who
were scattered throughout the countries outside Palestine. Such a group
lived on the island of Elephantine in the Nile, close to modern Aswân.
Their recovered documents, the famous Aramaic papyri edited by Cowley,
reflect their affairs for the quarter century ending in 399 b.c.
Thereafter, they disappear from recorded history. Other important Jewish
communities existed in Alexandria, Rome, Antioch, and numerous cities in
Asia Minor (see Safrai and Stern, I, 117–215; Smallwood, pp. 120–143,
201–255).

IV. MSS Discoveries
===================

Discoveries of MSS fragments at various locations in Palestine have made
a great contribution to the study of this period. The scrolls found at
Qumrân consist of Scripture texts and commentaries; Hebrew and Aramaic
portions or transcripts of apocryphal, targumic, and pseudepigraphical
literature, some of it previously known only in Greek; sectarian
documents that had long disappeared; etc. This recovered Essene library
is filling many gaps in intertestamental history and Christian
antecedents and forms an immensely valuable area of biblical study
(*see* Dead Sea Scrolls).

Other Judean caves have yielded fragmentary MSS, letters, and coins.
Remains of Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic MSS from the Cave of Horror
(*Naḥal* Heber) include a fragmentary Greek translation of the Minor
Prophets closer to the MT than the LXX. The caves at *Naḥal Ṣe˒ elim*
yielded a small parchment containing Ex. 13:1–16 in a form almost
identical to the MT. More impressive are the discoveries from the Cave
of Letters: small fragments of Pss. 15–16, Nu. 20:7f, and letters
written by Simon Bar Cochba to his cohorts. The cave at *Wâdī
Murabba˓ât* contained a scroll of the Minor Prophets, other biblical
books, and papyri in Greek, Latin, and Arabic. The excavations carried
on at Masada (1963–65) under the direction of Y. Yadin discovered
fragments of biblical scrolls including Genesis, Leviticus, Deuteronomy,
and Ezekiel. Nonbiblical fragments included a small portion of the book
of Jubilees in Hebrew and large fragments of chs 39–44 of the Hebrew
original of Sirach. A Hebrew text of Sirach was found in the Cairo
Genizah in 1910, and some scholars hotly disputed its genuineness,
stigmatizing it as a late translation from the Greek; but this MS from
Masada has proved them wrong. Some argue that this book would have been
included in the canon had its original been known at the right time (see
EAEHL, III, 665–694, 812–14).

V. Theological Concepts
=======================

Intertestamental Judaism in Palestine particularly included quiet
orthodoxy, fierce Zealot nationalism, subconscious assimilation, and
decadent hellenization. OT theology advanced in certain respects, with
important NT consequences, partly by internal development, partly by
naturalization of Zoroastrian and other elements. Diaspora Jews, devout
if less strictly orthodox, attempted allegorically and otherwise to
blend Greek philosophy with Hebraic tradition — the extreme example is
the Alexandrian Philo. Usually the amalgam was recognizably Jewish. In
1909 Schürer exhaustively examined the Palestinian (HJP, II/3, 1–155)
and the Hellenistic (II/3, 156–381) literature. To the Apocrypha,
Pseudepigrapha, Josephus, and Diaspora literature must now be added the
Dead Sea Scrolls. (These topics are discussed elsewhere in this
encyclopedia under their separate titles. On rabbinic Judaism, oral and
secondary at this state, supremely important later, *see* Commentaries,
Hebrew; Talmud; Targum.)

Loyalty to external Judaism reached its pinnacle in the Masada martyrs
(see III above); in the butchered thousand who would not break the
sabbath by resisting attack (1 Macc. 2:29–38; cf. 2 Macc. 6:11); and in
those who endured torture and death, rather than break the law by eating
pork (1 Macc. 2:61f; 2 Macc. 6:18–31; 7:1–42). The same spirit sent the
Qumrân covenanters to the stricter life of the desert. Aristobulus
(104–103 b.c.) exercised on Galileans and neighboring Ituraeans a policy
of forcible Judaizing by circumcision, though this was somewhat rare
(cf. Mt. 4:15). At the opposite extreme were skeptical hellenizers such
as those sporting youths under Antiochus Epiphanes, naked runners so
apostate from Judaism as to submit to surgical uncircumcision — Gk
*akrobystía* means foreskin, hence by metonymy the artificial
restoration thereof (1 Macc. 1:15; Asm.Mos. 8).

Intertestamental Jewish literature, historically and theologically
important, often differs in content from the books that Protestantism
considers inspired. Protestantism excludes all of it from the canon, and
thus rejects prayers for the dead (2 Macc. 12:43–45) and a doctrine of
salvation by works (2 Esd. 7:77; Tob. 4:9–11; etc.), concepts found in
the Roman Catholic Church, which regards these books as canonical. That
humanistic commonplace of rabbinic Judaism, the good and evil impulse in
man, is found in germ. The *cor malignum* of 2 Esd. 3:20 (NEB “wicked
heart”) foreshadows the evil impulse (cf. vv 48, 92; Gen. 8:21); for the
so-called good impulse, cf. Sir. 1:14.

Noncanonical apocalyptic, child of OT prophecy, emphasizes national and
individual judgment, eternal rewards and punishments, usually
postulating imminent eschatological climax. These apocryphal apocalypses
— symbolic, dualistic, esoteric, usually pseudonymous, and “history in
the guise of prediction” — claimed that they had been written by Moses,
Enoch, or some ancient worthy, and hidden since that author’s time for
this very emergency — a claim intolerable within the inspired canon and
to modern believers yet widely accepted at that time. Such writers of
such works, feeling deep spiritual affinity with their prototypes,
possessed a unitary Hebraic time sense, with a weakened apprehension of
chronological separation. They believed themselves to be God’s chosen
instruments to build up the people in dark days. Within Judaism,
apocalyptic lost its place to Rabbinism after a.d. 70, yet profoundly
influenced Christian theology, where it reached its high-water mark in
the book of Revelation. For apocalyptists and time, see Thorleif Boman,
*Hebrew Thought Compared with Greek* (Engtr 1960); D. S. Russell,
*Apocalyptic*, pp. 205–223.

Intertestamental Jewry sought to approach the transcendent God through
intermediaries; thus angelology became elaborated. In the Ezra
Apocalypse (2 Esd. 3–10) the prophet is instructed by the archangel
Uriel (cf. canonical Zechariah), and also by Tobit and Enoch. Evil,
rebellious angels, including Satan under his various designations, also
came to prominence. In certain sources (cf. 1 Enoch; Jubilees) the
fallen angels who united themselves to human females are designated
“watchers.” They, not God, are the source of evil, which has an extent
much wider than this terrestrial globe. In other sources evil is
explained by Adam’s original transgression, or by the evil impulse in
mankind.

A conception resembling the doctrine of original sin, consistently
bypassed by later rabbinic Judaism, is found in 2 Esd. 4:30–32; 7:11,
48, 118; these passages should be compared with key phrases in 1 Cor.
15. Individual responsibility is also stressed, in the spirit of Ezk. 18
(2 Esd. 7:102–106; cf. vv 112–15). Into this doctrine the idea of the
treasury of merits inconsistently intrudes (7:77). Comparable with Mt.
7:13f is the stern doctrine of majority damnation; some apocryphal
devices to justify the ways of God to man are not appealing (7:49–61;
8:1–3, 40f). The writer also stresses (8:55–60) that most people have
abused their free will, spurned God’s law, and brought condemnation upon
themselves. Original sin is implied clearly in Sir. 8:5; 25:24; cf. also
Wisd. 10:1. The possibility of avoiding direct transgression, or sin
with a high hand, is stressed in Tob. 4:5.

Vitally important are the interconnected concepts of Word and Wisdom.
The creative Word goes back by implication to the repeated “and God
said” of Gen. 1, but assumes firmer contours in the constantly recurring
paraphrastic *Memra* of the Targums — cf. sample passages translated in
Targum. The Greek form *lógos* began probably with the pagan Heraclitus
(ca 500 b.c.), passed through the hands of the Stoics several centuries
later, reappeared in theological form in Philo of Alexandria (d a.d.
40), then found its highest expression in Jn. 1:1–14. In classical Greek
philosophy, logos meant roughly the rational principle undergirding the
universe and its lifestream; for Philo, who intermingled metaphysics
with revealed religion, the concept, still impersonal, came to mean the
rational thought of God, the impress of His creative power on the scheme
of things. John ascribes all this and infinitely more to the incarnate
Son. The analogous concept of Wisdom, created by God and personified,
begins canonically with Prov. 8:22–31, becoming more sharply etched in
Sir. 1:1–10; Wisd. 7:22–26. The latter passage makes Wisdom “a pure
effluence from the glory of the Almighty … the flawless mirror of the
active power of God and the image of his goodness” (NEB). The creative
Word is found in Wisd. 9:1f, the decreeing Word in 18:15.

There are three levels of Jewish future expectation — a revived,
extended “Golden Age” Davidic kingdom in Palestine; a catastrophic,
destructive climax to this world (cf. 2 Pet. 3:5–11), with an eternal
age supervening; and the two combined, the first reappearing as some
kind of millennium. The popular first view falls below Eschatology
proper, but explains some reactions to the ministry of Jesus (cf. Jn.
6:15; Acts 1:6). Bultmann describes apocalyptic eschatology as “a
pessimistic-dualistic view of the Satanic corruption of the total
world-complex” — but this tabloid statement must not be too blindly
generalized.

Outstanding in Christian interest is the eschatology of 2 Esdras. The
age to come is first delineated as succeeding this one without pause or
interval (6:7–10). Messiah is to appear, inaugurating a reduced
“millennium” of four hundred years, after which he, and all living
beings, will die. Then after seven days of the silence of death will
come a general resurrection, followed by divine judgment (7:28–36). The
bliss of paradise is briefly described (8:52–54). These passages should
be compared with Dnl. 12; Rev. 20–21; etc. Chapter 6 must mean that
there is no interval between the present age and Messiah’s glorious
earthly reign — otherwise it would contradict ch 7. A thousand-year
millennium is found in the Slavonic Enoch, one of indefinite length in 2
Baruch. Angelology, the precosmic angelic fall, final judgment, the
destruction of the world, and eternal bliss and woe are more fully
portrayed in the Ethiopic and Slavonic versions of Enoch; the latter
incorporates the celestial architecture of the seven heavens (cf. 2 Cor.
12:2–4). The Assumption of Moses (ca 4 b.c.) has probable Qumrânic
links. Its lost ending is, according to some scholars, quoted in Jude 9.

Apocalyptic writers frequently recognized two Messiahs, one associated
with the priestly tribe of Levi, the other with the royal Davidic tribe
of Judah. This is carried over (with variations) into the Dead Sea
Scrolls (cf. 1QS 9:11) and into Talmud and Midrash (see R. A. Stewart,
*Rabbinic Theology* [1961], pp. 46–53). Under the new covenant the
Messiah is, of course, one and unique. There is, however, a dual strain
in the OT, the Suffering Servant, who reflects the passion, atonement,
and substitution of Christ’s first advent (Isa. 42:1–4; 49:4–9; 50:4–9;
52:13–53:12) and the Son of man, who will come with power and judgment
at the end of the age (Dnl. 7:13f), reflecting His second advent (cf.
Isa. 63:1–6; Rev. 19:11–16; and innumerable parallels).
