**Homosexuality:   
The Christian Perspective**

by   
Lehman Strauss, Litt.D., F.R.G.S.

**Q. What is homosexuality?**

Homosexuality is the manifestation of sexual desire toward a member of
one’s own sex or the erotic activity with a member of the same sex. (The
Greek word homos means *the same*). A lesbian is a female homosexual.
More recently the term “gay” has come into popular use to refer to both
sexes who are homosexuals.

**Q. How does one determine if the practice of homosexuality is right or
wrong?**

That depends upon who is answering the question. The Christian point of
view is based solely upon the Bible, the divinely inspired Word of God.
A truly Christian standard of ethics is the conduct of divine
revelation, not of statistical research nor of public opinion. For the
Christian, the Bible is the final authority for both belief and
behaviour.

**Q. What explicitly does the Bible teach about homosexuality?**

This question I consider to be basic because, if we accept God’s Word on
the subject of homosexuality, we benefit from His adequate answer to
this problem. I am concerned only with the Christian or biblical view of
homosexuality. The Bible has much to say about sex sins in general.

First, there is adultery. Adultery in the natural sense is sexual
intercourse of a married person with someone other than his or her own
spouse. It is condemned in both the Old and New Testaments (Exodus
20:14; I Cor. 6:9, 10). Christ forbids dwelling upon the thoughts, the
free play of one’s imagination that leads to adultery (Matthew 5:28).

Second, there is fornication, the illicit sex acts of unmarried persons
which is likewise forbidden (I Corinthians 5:1; 6:13, 18; Ephesians
5:3).

Then there is homosexuality which likewise is condemned in Scripture.
The Apostle Paul, writing by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, declares
that homosexuality “shall not inherit the kingdom of God” (I Corinthians
6:9; 10). Now Paul does not single out the homosexual as a special
offender. He includes fornicators, idolators, adulterers, thieves,
covetous persons, drunkards, revilers and extortioners. And then he adds
the comment that some of the Christians at Corinth had been delivered
from these very practices: “And such were some of you: But ye are
washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the
Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God” (I Corinthians 6:11). All of
the sins mentioned in this passage are condemned by God, but just as
there was hope in Christ for the Corinthians, so is there hope for all
of us.

Homosexuality is an illicit lust forbidden by God. He said to His people
Israel, “Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
abomination” (Leviticus 18:22). “If a man also lie with mankind, as he
lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they
shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them” (Leviticus
20:13). In these passages homosexuality is condemned as a prime example
of sin, a sexual perversion. The Christian can neither alter God’s
viewpoint nor depart from it.

In the Bible sodomy is a synonym for homosexuality. God spoke plainly on
the matter when He said, “There shall be no whore of the daughters of
Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel” (Deuteronomy 23:17). The
whore and the sodomite are in the same category. A sodomite was not an
inhabitant of Sodom nor a descendant of an inhabitant of Sodom, but a
man who had given himself to homosexuality, the perverted and unnatural
vice for which Sodom was known. Let us look at the passages in question:

But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,
compassed the house around, both old and young, all the people from
every quarter:

And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which
came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know
them.

And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, And
said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I
pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your
eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the
shadow of my roof. (Genesis 19:4‑8)

The Hebrew word for “know” in verse 5 is ya„da\`, a sexual term. It is
used frequently to denote sexual intercourse (Genesis 4:1, 17, 25;
Matthew 1:24, 25). The message in the context of Genesis 19 is clear.
Lot pled with the men to “do not so wickedly.” Homosexuality is
wickedness and must be recognized as such else there is no hope for the
homosexual who is asking for help to be extricated from his perverted
way of life.

**Q. You said that sexua1 intercourse outside of marriage is condemned
in the Bible. How do you explain marriage ceremonies in which two
persons of the same sex are united by an officiating clergyman or
justice of the peace?**

There are cases on record where a marriage license was issued to persons
of the same sex. I recall one such incident in Phoenix, Arizona. A
marriage license was issued in the Maricopa County clerk’s office to two
men 39 and 21 years old respectively. The two men are reported to have
“married” in a private ceremony.

However, to call a union of two persons of the same sex a “marriage” is
a misnomer. In the Bible, marriage is a divinely ordered institution
designed to form a permanent union between one man and one woman for one
purpose (among others) of procreating or propagating the human race.
That was God’s order in the first of such unions (Genesis 1:27, 28;
2:24; Matthew 19:5). If, in His original creation of humans, God had
created two persons of the same sex, there would not be a human race in
existence today. The whole idea of two persons of the same sex marrying
is absurd, unsound, ridiculously unreasonable, stupid. A clergyman might
bless a homosexual marriage but God won’t.

**Q. A Jesuit Priest, John J. McNeill, reportedly said in a conference
(Christianity Today, June 3, 1977), “There is no clear condemnation of
homosexual activity to be found anywhere in the Bible.” How does a
church leader arrive at such a conclusion?**

This particular Jesuit priest, like some other supposedly Christian
theologians, have totally ignored the Scriptures as the guidelines for
Christian behaviour in regard to homosexuality. McNeill does not speak
for the Roman Catholic Church, but for a small segment of priests who,
having vowed themselves to celibacy, that is, to abstain from marriage
and sexual intercourse, have found sexual gratification in homosexual
acts.

However, religious sex perverts are plentiful among protestants.
Protestant leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have gradually eased
away from the Scriptures. In England men like Bishop John Robinson, in
his book *Honest to God* made a play on the term “The New Morality,”
which in reality was a plea to open the door to immorality making it
respectable and thus acceptable. The Bishop went so far as to describe
the unscriptural adulterous relationship as “a kind of holy communion.”
This modern concept of Christian ethics rejects totally the precepts
laid down by God in His Word. It is blasphemous and atheistic.

Recently in America ten homosexually oriented religious organizations,
comprised of men and women from more than a dozen denominations, and
from seventeen states and Canada, met at Kirkbridge, a retreat and study
center near Bangor, Pennsylvania. The retreat was entitled, “Gay and
Christian.” But the two terms, “gay” and “Christian” are mutually
exclusive, incompatible, incongruous.

Representing the women at that retreat, Nancy Krody a lesbian, spoke on
“The Lesbian Christian Experience.” Here again is a misnomer. A
practicing Christian, from the biblical viewpoint, will not be a
practicing homosexual. Of course, I make the distinction between a
professing Christian and a practicing Christian. Calling one’s self a
Christian does not make one a Christian.

Malcolm Boyd speaks about “The Gay Male Christian Experience.” Boyd, a
protestant clergyman, says he has been a homosexual secretly for years.
Only recently he made a public announcement of his homosexuality. He
claims that his public announcement of his homosexuality has brought him
back to the church. Boyd does not tell us what he means by the “church”!

Following is one point on which the speakers at Kirkbridge agreed: “A
monogamous homosexual relationship characterized by fidelity, honesty
and love is possible, desirable, and honoring to God.”

Any evil condemned in Scripture cannot be honoring to God. Homosexual
religious leaders attempt to smooth over the breaks and rough places
with Christian terminology so that a euphoria predominates, but God is
not in it. A truly born again person, who loves and understands the
Bible as God’s revelation to him, will not condone an evil that God
condemns. “If ye know that He is righteous, ye know that every one that
doeth righteousness is born of Him” (I John 2:29). “Nevertheless the
foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them
that are His. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart
from iniquity” (II Timothy 2:19). Practicing homosexuals are engaged in
a divinely forbidden evil.

**Q. Why do homosexuals refer to themselves as “gay”?**

The word “gay” means merry, exuberant, bright, lively. More recently it
has been adopted by homosexuals. In its original use it did not have
this double meaning. The clever adaptation of the word “gay” by
homosexuals has robbed it of its pure meaning, thereby corrupting a once
perfectly good word. I never use the word “gay” when referring to
homosexuals. There are many bright, exuberant, merry people in this
world who are not sexual perverts.

**Q. You made reference to First Corinthians 6:9‑11. What is the meaning
of the word “effeminate” in verse 9?**

There are certain words in every language that can be used in a good or
bad sense. In the context of this verse the use of “effeminate” is
obviously in a bad sense. It is listed among other evils which are
condemned. It describes feminine qualities inappropriate to a man. It is
normal and natural for a woman to be sexually attracted to a man; it is
abnormal and unnatural for a man to be sexually attracted to another
man. Many male homosexuals are effeminate, but not all. Nor are all
lesbians unduly masculine.

**Q. Are there other Scriptures in the New Testament which deal with
homosexuality?**

Yes. Romans 1:24‑27; I Timothy 1:10 and Jude 7. If one takes these
Scriptures seriously, homosexuality will be recognized as an evil. The
Romans passage is unmistakably clear. Paul attributes the moral
depravity of men and women to their rejection of “the truth of God”
(1:25). They refused “to retain God in their knowledge” (1:28), thereby
dethroning God and deifying themselves. The Old Testament had clearly
condemned homosexuality but in Paul’s day there were those persons who
rejected its teaching. Because of their rejection of God’s commands He
punished their sin by delivering them over to it.

The philosophy of substituting God’s Word with one’s own reasoning
commenced with Satan. He introduced it at the outset of the human race
by suggesting to Eve that she ignore God’s orders, assuring her that in
so doing she would become like God with the power to discern good and
evil (Genesis 3:1‑5). That was Satan’s big lie. Paul said that when any
person rejects God’s truth, his mind becomes “reprobate,” meaning
perverted, void of sound judgment. The perverted mind, having rejected
God’s truth, is not capable of discerning good and evil.

In Romans 1:26‑31 twenty‑three punishable sins are listed with
homosexuality leading the list. Paul wrote, “For this cause God gave
them up into vile affections: for even their women did change the
natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the
men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one
toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and
receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet”
(Romans 1:26, 27). These verses are telling us that homosexuals suffer
in their body and personality the inevitable consequences of their wrong
doing. Notice that the behaviour of the homosexual is described as a
“vile affection” (1:26). The Greek word translated “vile” (*atimia*)
means filthy, dirty, evil, dishonourable. The word “affection” in Greek
is*pathos*, used by the Greeks of either a good or bad desire. Here in
the context of Romans it is used in a bad sense. The “vile affection” is
a degrading passion, a shameful lust. Both the desire (lusting after)
and the act of homosexuality are condemned in the Bible as sin.

**Q. There are those persons who say that homosexuality, even though a
perverted form of the normal, God‑ordained practice of sex, is a genetic
problem, constitutionally inherited. Is there evidence to support this
view?**

I read in a periodical that in June, 1963 a panel of specialists in
medicine, psychiatry, law, sociology and theology participated in a
conference on homosexuality called by the Swiss Evangelical Church
Union. That group reached the conclusion that homosexuality is not
constitutionally inherited, it is not a part of one’s genetic makeup.
The ill-founded and unverifiable myth that homosexuality results from
genetic causes is gradually fading away.

There are possibly a number of different ways in which homosexual
practices could begin. When boys and girls reach puberty and the genital
organs develop, it is not uncommon for boys to experiment with boys, and
girls with girls. In prisons where men and women are denied access to
persons of the opposite sex for long periods of time, some are
introduced to homosexuality for the first time.

A young Christian woman came to our office in Detroit for counseling.
She became involved in lesbianism when her marriage began to fail. She
was introduced to her first homosexual experience by a divorcee who was
her neighbor. After six months of practicing lesbianism she was
convicted of her sin and sought help. We were able to show her from the
Bible that she was sinning and that God stood ready and willing to
forgive and cleanse her. She confessed and forsook her sin, and
continues to this day to live a happy, normal Christian life.

Homosexuality must be accepted for what God says it is– sin. Some
homosexuals will attempt to circumvent the plain teaching of the Bible
with the insipid reply that they are the way God made them. There is not
the slightest bit of evidence in Scripture to support this false
concept. God never created man with a so‑called “homosexual need.” No
baby is born a homosexual. Every baby is born male or female. In every
place the Bible refers to homosexuality, the emphasis is upon the
perversion of sexuality. The practicing homosexual is guilty of “leaving
the natural use of the woman” (Romans 1:27), meaning that his behaviour
is “against nature” as in the case of the lesbian (Romans 1:26).
Inasmuch as homosexuality is opposed to the regular law and order of
nature, the genetic concept must be ruled out completely. If
homosexuality were a genetic problem, there would be little hope for the
homosexual simply because there is no way that the genes in a person can
be changed.

**Q. Are there contributing factors to homosexuality for which a
homosexual might not be responsible?**

Yes, I believe there are. I have not done much research in this area,
however, studies made by others showed varied deviations from the
average or normal parent‑child relationship. For example, clinical cases
show that some homosexuals have not had a normal or natural relationship
with the parent of the same sex. In some instances there has been a wide
gap between father and son. There are those boys who have been neglected
by their unaffectionate fathers. The boy who has not had a good and
wholesome relationship with his father could have an unfulfilled need
for a father relationship with a man. Now that need will not start out
as a sexual one, but there are cases on record in which the sexual
relationship has developed. I know one case of a homosexual adult who
seduced a 13 year old boy whose father had forsaken him. Before the
boy’s contact with the older man he had no knowledge whatever of
homosexuality. The older man seduced the boy.

Lesbianism has been known to follow this same pattern. Some
mother‑daughter relationships are not conducive to a normal social and
sexual development. One young woman came to her pastor seeking help. She
had gotten involved with a lesbian in the community where she lived, a
woman twenty‑one years her senior. The girl’s parents had a defective
marriage which ended in divorce when the daughter was ten years old. Her
mother became bitter and resentful against all men. She convinced her
daughter that men were not to be trusted, and that man’s one goal was to
exploit women sexually. The daughter grew up with a fear of men, a fear
totally unwarranted. She was an easy victim of the seductive older
lesbian. The good and wise pastor showed the counselee from the Bible
that homosexuality was sinful and that God condemned it. She confessed
her sin to God and received Jesus Christ as her Savior and Lord. Today
she is happily married to a fine Christian man.

**Q. Do you believe that the homosexual controversy is causing problems
for the churches of America?**

Evil in any form is a problem in the church. It always has been. The
greater problem, however, is the church’s failure to discipline evil
when it arises. Karl Menninger’s book, *Whatever Became of Sin?,* deals
directly with that point. There are ministers, priests, and rabbis who
never talk about sin. There was a time when the minister of God’s Word
preached the whole counsel of God. Today many pulpits are silent on the
sin question. Sin has become fashionable and therefore acceptable. When
sin gets its victim into serious difficulty, the psychiatrist and
psychologist tell him he is sick. The church must face the fact of sin
squarely.

**Q. Does the Bible tell us how the church should deal with sexual
sins?**

In Old Testament times in Israel God dealt severely with homosexuals. He
warned His people through Moses, “If a man also lie with mankind, as he
lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they
shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them” (Leviticus
20:13). Every Jew knew that homosexuality was an abomination, a
disgusting practice to be loathed, hated. This was God’s attitude toward
that evil practice. He hated it to the extent that He considered it
worthy of punishment by death. Now God loved His people Israel dearly,
and it was from His great heart of love that He chastened them. The
Epistle to the Hebrews says, “For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth” (Hebrews 12:7). When God
issued His law forbidding homosexuality, and the punishment for those
persons who violated that law, He did so in order to prevent them from
sinning. However, when anyone broke the law, the offender paid the
penalty due him. God is a holy God who hates and judges sin. Parents who
love their children will not refrain from warning them of prevailing
evils, nor will they fail to chasten them when they disobey. The church
today not only tolerates sin but in some instances condones it. God does
neither.

In the New Testament the principle of discipline was applied with
apostolic authority. In the church at Corinth the young man who was
committing fornication with his step‑mother was excommunicated. Paul
instructed the church to take that action “in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ . . . and with the power (i.e. the authority) of our Lord Jesus
Christ” (I Corinthians 5:1‑8). In Romans 1:21‑32 where Paul shows the
Gentile world in its downward plunge into sin, including the sin of
homosexuality, verse 32 concludes with the words, “who knowing the
judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death
. . .” Worthy of death, yes. But today we are not under law but under
grace. People used to hear and heed the Gospel‑truth, the message that
God is holy, man is a sinner, and that through faith in the
substitutionary death and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ, sinful
people can be born again and thereby delivered from the guilt and
penalty and practice of their sins.

**Q. Do you have any suggestions or recommendations for the church?**

Nothing is more foundationally essential for the church and the world
than a return to the truth. Recently I read where someone said we are
suffering from a famine of the worst kind, “a truth‑famine.” Our modern
culture is in a degenerating, deteriorating stage caused by a departure
from the truth. And I must say unequivocally that truth does not exist
independently of God, and His written Word the Bible, and His Son Jesus
Christ. Truth is in no sense of man’s imagination or contrivance. Man in
his fallen state does not know truth, and that is why he continues to go
on sinning. A civilization without the truth is doomed to oblivion.
Every ancient civilization that ignored God and His laws has crumbled.
Our present civilization is well on the road to doom. We cannot survive
independently of God and His Word.

The Church must return to the truth, the whole truth, the sum total of
truth founded and grounded upon Him Who said, “I am the truth” (John
14:6). In our Lord’s high priestly prayer for His own He prayed,
“Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy Word is truth” (John 17:17). There
must be in our churches the clear exposition of the Scriptures and a
continuing exaltation of the Person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ if
our civilization is to be saved from the disasters that overcame past
civilizations. Any civilization with a philosophy or a doctrine which
denies the real truth cannot survive.

**Q. Do you see any prophetic significance in the recent homosexual
upsurge?**

Yes, I do. However, I would suggest caution on this point. It is not
uncommon for preachers to attach a prophetic meaning to every
earthquake, riot, war, moral scandal or political disaster, labeling all
such events as “signs of the times.”

The modern homosexual upsweep is one phase of a declining trend in
morals. When the disciples asked our Lord, “What shall be the sign of
Thy coming, and of the consummation of the age?” He told them that
“iniquity shall abound” (Matthew 24:3, 12). There is today a
permissiveness and a promiscuity in sexual behaviour unprecedented in
the history of America. There is little restraint upon the widespread of
material containing pictures and writing depicting erotic behaviour
intended to cause sexual excitement. This would be included in our
Lord’s prophecy about abounding iniquity.

There is also a prophetic statement in Paul’s Second Epistle to Timothy
which has some bearing upon the subject we are discussing. Paul said,
“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For
men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural
affection . . .” (II Timothy 3:1‑3). Homosexuality is an unnatural
affection, practiced by persons “that defile themselves with mankind” (I
Timothy 1:10), translated in the New American Standard Version
“homosexuals,” and in the New International Version, “perverts.” I
conclude, in the light of these Scriptures, that the rise of
homosexuality is very definitely a trend which indicates the approaching
end of the age.

**Q. Have you personally counseled with homosexuals?**

Yes, in two pastorates over a period of twenty‑five years. In each
instance the homosexual was a man in his thirties who had seduced
teen‑aged boys. The seduction of younger persons is a pattern most
homosexuals follow. They seem to prefer gratifying their lust with
youth. This is a pattern typical of men who marry several wives. Men who
do not respect their marriage vows pursue women younger than themselves.
One man of wealth was reportedly married and divorced six times. Most of
his wives were young enough to be his daughters. The two homosexual men
who applied for a marriage license in the Maricopa County Clerk’s Office
in Arizona were 39 and 21 years old, quite a variation in ages.

**Q. Do you attach any significance to the age factor you mentioned?**

Yes, I do. I see a potential threat to young people who are exposed to
homosexuals. Older practicing homosexuals are a threat to the youth.

**Q. Do you care to make any comments on the Anita Bryant crusade in
Dade County, Florida?**

In my judgment Anita Bryant was justified in the action she pursued. She
did not want her children exposed to the influence of a practicing
homosexual in the public school classroom. Inasmuch as homosexuality is
classified in the Bible as an evil, to insist that children be exposed
to homosexual teachers in the public schools would be an infringement
upon the rights of parents and their children. Under no condition would
I permit my children to be subjected to the influence of a sex pervert.
As an American citizen I consider that choice to be my right. Anita
Bryant laid her career on the line in the bold and courageous stand she
took. She should not have to fight the battle alone. Christians should
support her.

**Q. What should be the Christian’s attitude toward the homosexual?**

We must always keep before us the fact that homosexuals, like all of us
sinners, are the objects of God’s love. The Bible says, “But God
commendeth His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ
died for us” (Romans 5:8). Jesus Christ “is the propitiation for our
sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world”
(I John 2:2). The Christian who shares God’s love for lost sinners will
seek to reach the homosexual with the gospel of Christ, which “is the
power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16).
As a Christian I should hate all sin but I can find no justification for
hating the sinner. The homosexual is a precious soul for whom Christ
died. We Christians can show him the best way of life by pointing him to
Christ. Our Lord said, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel
to every creature” (Mark 16:15). We are obligated to take the gospel to
all.

**Q. How can we help Christians who get involved in the practice of
homosexuality?**

We can help them by seeking to draw their attention to what God says in
His Word. In a kind and loving spirit we can show them that they are
wrong. However, the homosexual must admit to the fact that he is living
in sin and that he has the desire to be made free from it. Without a
genuine conviction of God’s displeasure and a strong desire to do God’s
will, there is no hope. A truly born again person cannot continue to
practice sin without reaping the results of miserable unhappiness
brought on by loss of fellowship with God, the fear of retribution and
the anxiety produced by guilt. The homosexual must ask himself, “Is the
temporary gratification of the flesh worth all the penalty and losses I
must suffer?”

Dr. Strauss taught Old Testament history for eight years at Philadelphia
Bible Institute, and served as pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church,
Bristol, Pennsylvania, from 1939 to 1957. He was pastor of Highland Park
Baptist Church (Highland Park, Michigan) until the end of 1963 when he
resigned to devote full time to an itinerant Bible conference and
evangelistic ministry both in the States and abroad. Dr. Strauss was
writing his 19th book at age 86 when he went home to be with the Lord in
June 1997. This pamphlet was originally made available through the Biola
Hour radio ministry. His written materials are used by permission.
