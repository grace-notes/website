Jewish Law [^1]
---------------

Following the analogy of the law of Scotland, we may arrange the code of
the Hebrews into Statutory or Written (meaning by this the law of Moses)
and Customary or Unwritten law (referring to the traditional law of the
Mishnah). It is with the latter exclusively that we have at present to
do. All jurisdiction was either civil, criminal, or ecclesiastical,
according as questions of private right, public morality, or religious
duty were to be decided. It requires, however, to be borne in mind, that
by the peculiar constitution of the Jewish courts, and by the
institutions of the country, a complete separation between these
different branches could not be effected. Besides the above, a number of
police, sanitary, and public regulations were also enacted by the
Rabbins, which we shall notice as occasion offers.

The Jewish law acknowledged rights in every individual, and, with few
exceptions, placed all on a footing of equality. We have already
referred to some of the rights of women, and shall only supplement our
statements. Though a mother could not claim equal respect, she was on
the same footing towards her children as the father, and biblical
examples of her influence will readily occur. All the forbids of the law
applied equally to both sexes, but all those commands whose execution
was confined to certain definite periods (for example, the day-time,
etc.), were only binding on males. Legal exceptions to the validity of
marriages entailed the disqualification of the offspring. In all
ordinary circumstances the child inherited the rank of the father. If
the mothers had been incapable of contracting marriage, as in the case
of female slaves, -the children ranked with the mother. Thus the family
of a bastard might become legitimate, if the bastard (father) married a
slave (mother). Their children were then not bastards, but slaves, and,
being emancipated, might become legitimate citizens, and intermarry with
Israelites.

Of the different relations of foreigners to Jews we have already spoken.
They were either passing or resident strangers, or naturalized denizens.
An uncircumcised person was allowed to offer sacrifices and tithes (of
course according to the Jewish ritual), but not to partake in the
Passover, or to marry a Jewess. Jews were allowed to marry the daughters
of heathens, except those of the seven Canaanitish nations, and of the
Amalekites. The grandchildren of Egyptians and Edomites, who had settled
in Palestine, might enter the congregation. The law with reference to
the Moabites and Ammonites, as well as to the seven nations and the
Amalekites, was, however, repealed by the Rabbins in favor of
proselytes, and the sons of all foreigners resident in Palestine, and
all proselytes, were allowed to enter into the congregation. Any
intercourse with heathens which might either further their idolatry, or
issue to the disadvantage of the Jewish nation, was interdicted.

We can hardly suppose that foreigners resident in Palestine troubled
themselves much about Jewish regulations; but, according to the theory
of the Rabbins, they were obliged to observe the seven Noachic
Commandments which we have formerly specified. Finally, it is
noticeable, that the Mishnah confines the term bastards to those
begotten in incest, to cases where marriage had been legally impossible,
and to the children of harlots.

Every householder shared in all the public burdens, such as the keeping
up of roads, baths, city walls, gates, etc. Any party who transferred a
public road from one part of his property to another, forfeited his
right to both, All obstructions were to be removed from streets and
roads, and, where they had been the occasion of damage, the person to
whom it was traced was liable for compensation. All property consisting
of fields was restored in the jubilee, but the party restoring could
claim something for improvements made. Within that period fields could
be redeemed by the original proprietor only after a lapse of two years
from their disposal. Houses in open (not walled) towns, or in villages,
or in fields etc. enclosed within town walls, or built on the city wall
itself, were considered as fields, and returned in the jubilee to the
original proprietors. Houses in walled or in un-walled towns might be
redeemed by the original proprietor within a year after their sale; but
after the lapse of a full year, houses in walled towns remained the
perpetual property of the purchaser.

To our former remarks on servitude, we add, that only one of two grounds
could exist for the servitude of a Hebrew, namely, theft, when, in order
to discharge the legal pecuniary punishment, the authorities might order
the sale of the culprit; or poverty inducing a Jew to sell himself. His
servitude lasted till the jubilee or till the death of his master, or he
might obtain freedom by paying the amount for which he was sold, after
deduction of the value of his services. Hebrew maids obtained freedom in
the seventh year; nor could they have their ears bored. If a Hebrew sold
his daughter, the law assumed that it was for the purpose of marriage,
and forbade her sale by her master. As she could only be sold during her
minority, she attained freedom whenever the marks of puberty appeared. A
heathen slave might obtain his liberty by redemption, manumission, or in
consequence of ill-usage.

If a slave was sold to a heathen, or beyond the boundaries of Palestine,
he obtained by the very act his legal freedom, and, if fugitive, could
not be reclaimed. Heathen slaves, however, did not share all the
privileges of Jewish servants. Thus, for example, they could not retain
possession of anything found by them. If the slave of a heathen became a
proselyte through baptism, he received his freedom when sold to a Jew.
The daughters of such proselytes enjoyed the same rights as other Hebrew
women, and, if their mother had been a Jewess, might even be married to
priests. If a man left his fortune to his slave, he attained with it his
liberty also. Regular letters of manumission were given, in which the
essential words were “ from this time forth be free,” or be “ thine own
master.” These letters, if once written, even though not delivered or
dispatched, could not again be annulled. Hired servants, if engaged by
the day, could claim their wages at night if during the night, on the
following day. But while the law respected the rights of the employed,
it also carefully protected the employer.

Properly speaking, marriage was considered a purely civil contract, but
it was customary to wed the bride in presence of witnesses, and with the
pronunciation of certain blessings, or to wed her “ according to the law
of Moses and of Israel.” A bride descended from the family of Aaron had
a double dowry (400 dinars) assigned to her. If a young girl had been
married while a minor, she was allowed to repudiate her husband on
attaining her majority; if the marriage had taken place without her
consent, it was necessarily void. In all other cases, from the moment
the marriage-contract had been signed the union could only be separated
by formal divorce. If sufficient funds were on hand, a bride could
insist on having a portion assigned to her conformable to her station in
life. A second daughter could claim a portion equal to that of her elder
sister.

A mistaken opinion as to the circumstances of the bride, unless she had
willfully deceived her intended, formed no valid ground for divorce. If
the lady’s property had been entered into the marriage contract, the
bridegroom was bound to assign to his wife the full value of her
portion, and one-half more, or, if it consisted in jewelry, etc.,
one-fifth less than their value. In such cases the property belonged to
the husband, either simply for use the wife retaining her right of
disposal or absolutely, the husband being, however, answerable for any
loss. If a wife inherited property, the husband enjoyed only the use of
it, but a wife could not dispose of any property without the consent of
her husband. If the husband’s rights were attainted by any vow of his
wife, he was at liberty to absolve her from such obligations. The duties
of both parties, and their mutual rights, have already been detailed.

We add, that the claims of the wife upon her dowry, and those of
children, did not require to be expressly mentioned in the
marriage-contract. The husband was the heir of his wife. In cases of
separation (not divorce) he was bound to assign her a proper aliment. In
cases of dispute, the law protected chiefly the interests of wives. One
witness, even though incapable of giving testimony in other cases, was
sufficient to attest the death of the husband, Ie. if no suspicion of
collusion existed; but a period of three months was to elapse between a
first and second marriage. Before receiving her dowry, the wife had to
swear that she had not previously got any portion. We need not detail
the laws regulating marriage with the wife of a deceased brother, as
even the Mishnah recommends that it should not be performed. An
Israelite was prevented from marrying within the prescribed degrees of
consanguinity, and priests from uniting themselves with harlots, with
divorced or profane persons, Ie. the offspring of marriages forbidden to
priests.

To prevent interdicted marriages, every priest was to inquire into the
family of his bride (up to four degrees, if she descended from the
family of Aaron in other circumstances, to five degrees), except when
the bride’s father was a priest in active service, or a member of the
Sanhedrin. The daughters of proselytes, provided that one of their
parents had been an Israelite, and of the daughters of degraded priests,
might be married by priests. In a city taken by an enemy, the priests
had to divorce their wives, unless special testimony could be borne to
their chastity.

Although divorce was lawful, the various regulations to be observed
must, in practice, have considerably limited it, and its practice was
generally reprobated. Besides, it was always first sought to bring about
a reconciliation. If a wife had transgressed “the law of Moses” (in her
duties as wife), “or that of Israel” (by immodesty or forwardness,
etc.), and in other exceptional cases, she had no claim on her dowry. A
letter of divorce had to be signed by witnesses, and expressly stated
that N. N. was now regularly divorced, and free to marry any other. In
prospect of a distant journey, or of death, the mere order of the
husband to draw up a letter of divorce was deemed sufficient, except
when he had specially been solicited to do so. Letters of divorce might
be transmitted by messengers, provided they had been delivered by both
parties in the presence of witnesses. The messenger was not allowed to
marry the divorced party. Where the doubtful fame of a woman was the
ground of separation, she could never be taken back again.

The mutual rights and duties of parents and children have been already
referred to. While the sons were in measure independent, the father
could dispose of his daughters during their minority, either by marrying
or by selling them. However, the disposal of a daughter was deemed
improper, except in cases of urgent necessity. Although the father was
bound to have his son circumcised, redeemed, educated, trained to a
trade, and even taught to swim, some maintained that he was under no
legal obligation to maintain his daughters.

The first-born son inherited a double portion of the property actually
left by the father (not by the mother), and on hand at the time of his
decease. Sons and their descendants, though these descendants were
females, were considered the sole heirs, when even the right of
primogeniture extended to the daughters of the deceased eldest son in
preference to their father’s brothers. Failing direct heirs, the
property passed to the father of the deceased, and then to his brothers
or sisters, and so on upwards. Bastards, or the offspring of illicit
connections, with the exception of the children of heathen or slave
mothers, were not excluded from sharing in the inheritance. Crimes of
any kind did not disqualify from the above rights.

The Rabbinical law makes provision for disposal by testament. It
distinguished between the disposition of persons in good health and of
those in prospect of death. The latter might either leave or dispose of
their property, if such disposal did not run contrary to the law of
Moses. Only an inheritance could never go wholly beyond the circle of
the rightful heirs, nor could any of them be excluded by name, though
they might be tacitly passed by.

If a person in good health gifted away any portion of his property,
actual possession on the part of the recipient was requisite to complete
the transaction. If a patient recovered, he could recall the donation,
provided he had not, by retaining part of his original property,
indicated that he had at the time anticipated recovery. The claims of
the widow have already been referred to. The duty of burying a widow
devolved upon her legal heirs.’ A widow could only claim payment of her
dowry from what was actually left at the time of her husband’s decease.
Daughters had to be maintained by their brothers, even though this would
have thrown the latter upon public charity. Where the father had not
chosen tutors or curators, such were appointed by the authorities. The
wife was not heir to her husband, nor a mother to her children. The
husband might formally renounce his right to his wife’s property,
whereupon she was at liberty during her lifetime to dispose of it.

A farmer was obliged to keep the ground in good order, and to make all
customary improvements. If a crop was destroyed by locusts, fire, or any
public calamity, the damage was borne by the landlord. Leases were
generally for seven years, but flax might only be sown or wood cut
during the first year, as the former exhausted the ground, and the
latter took long time to grow. If any person let his house to another in
winter without fixing a term, he could not dispossess the occupant
between the Feast of Tabernacles and that of the Passover (the end of
autumn and the end of spring). In summer, thirty days’ notice of removal
had to be given, and, to the occupants of shops or of town-houses, a
full twelvemonth. The occupants of manufactories and large works had to
receive three years’ notice. The proprietor was bound to execute any
repairs which required a tradesman.

The law distinguished between movable and immovable property. The latter
afforded security to creditors even where such had not formally been
stated; the former did not. Claims upon movable property could only be
substantiated if such property had actually been delivered, else neither
the fact of payment nor the statement of witnesses could make the
transaction legal. Immovable property was acquired by payment, document,
or actual possession. In cases of exchange of one article for another,
actual possession by one of the parties was sufficient.’ A deaf and dumb
person might conclude a bargain by signs, and if a transaction had been
concluded, no after-agreement could annul it.

The drawing up of documents for various purposes presupposed such minute
acquaintance with the forms of law, the smallest neglect of which
destroyed their validity, that professional writers, were soon required.

It was customary for them to keep the formulas requisite for divorces
and other legal transactions written out and ready for immediate use.
Documents were either plain or folded. In plain documents the contents
were recorded consecutively, and the signatures of two witnesses
followed at the end. In folded documents a fold succeeded after every
few lines, and was always attested by three witnesses. Any informality,
or the absence of proper signatures of witnesses, rendered the document
invalid.

A letter of divorce might be drawn up in the absence of the wife, and
her receipt for the dowry in the husband’s absence an acknowledgment of
debt in the absence of the creditor, and a letter of purchase in that of
the buyer. Documents concerning marriage, farms, arbitration, or
judicial findings, could only be written with the consent of both
parties, and the latter were valid even if drawn up by non-Jewish
authorities.

Property professedly bought or received, consisting of houses,
fountains, baths, slaves, fields, and anything else from which continual
profit might be derived, was indisputable if the original proprietor had
not, during three years, objected to the validity of the rights of the
holder of the property. The holder of the property was not bound after
that term to produce documents to prove his right of tenure, provided he
had, during that period, given the original proprietor sufficient
intimation of his claims. But the burden of proof might rest on the
defender in the case of tradesmen or workmen, of part proprietors,
farmers who shared in the fruits of the ground, of curators, or in
questions between husband and wife or father and son, If a property was
too small for division, or such division was inconvenient, neither party
could insist on it unless prepared to purchase the whole.

Where flats belonged to different parties, the proprietor of the upper
storey could, if the house fell, insist on the rebuilding of the lower,
or take possession of the ground. A wall had to be removed at least four
cubits from the windows of a neighbor, and if broad enough to allow a
person to stand upon it, required to be built either four cubits higher
or lower than such windows. Where a neighbor’s wall was in danger of
being injured by any operation, a distance of three spans was to
intervene, and the wall to be protected. It was not allowed to cultivate
in a field what might injure the crop or property of a neighbor as to
cultivate mustard if a neighbor owned beehives.

Trees had to be removed four cubits from the property of a neighbor, and
the branches, if they overhung the wall, might be cut off. If two
gardens, of which the one was higher than the other, bounded, the
declivity belonged in part to both, so that the proprietor of the higher
ground claimed so much as he could reach from his property with his
hand, while all the rest went with the lower ground.

Sequestration of an insolvent required legal permission. A curious legal
provision, strongly indicative of the altered times and views, was made
by the Rabbins to prevent the cessation of monetary obligations in the
Sabbatical year. It was not only declared lawful to accept payment
during that year (if proffered), but such conduct on the part of the
debtor was declared meritorious. It was also enacted that debts
contracted upon pledges, or secured by written documents deposited in
court, or containing an express reservation of the right of reclaiming
on the part of the creditor, technically termed Prosbol, did not come
within the range of the Sabbatical remission.

The Prosbol was introduced by Hillel as a means of restoring public
credit. If a debtor died, the claims of heirs took precedence of those
of the creditors, and the claims of the widow upon her dowry were those
of a creditor. Various provisions were made for the protection of either
party from fraud. Acknowledgments of debt did not require to contain the
name of the lender, and were payable to any party who possessed the
document. If a dying person declared in general terms, that one amongst
many outstanding loans had been repaid to him, all obligations to him
became thereby invalid (on account of the doubt), but if more than one
had been incurred by onr creditor, only the largest was held to be
discharged. In cases of part repayment a special receipt was granted. If
a party wholly denied a debt, he could not be constrained to swear, as
the law assumed his innocence, and the burden of proof rested with the
pursuer. It was otherwise when the defender admitted part of the debt.
Notices of orders, etc., in a merchant’s books, were admitted as partial
proofs.

The Jewish law arranged all occasions of damage under four classes, as
those by cattle, by pits, by grazing, and by fire. If a person dug a pit
ten span deep, he was responsible for deterioration or loss of any
animal which had fallen into it; otherwise, only for the former,
Anything left or spilt on the street which occasioned damage, involved
responsibility. The person last engaged with an object causing damage,
was held responsible, and the amount computed by competent judges. If
any object had been lost, or received damage, while in the temporary
possession of a stranger, the law made several distinctions.

If a party had been entrusted with an article, he could not be sued for
damages; if he had borrowed it, he was obliged to pay damages; if it had
passed out of the proprietor’s hands in the way of business, the
temporary owner, who had remained within the conditions of the contract,
was only responsible if it had been stolen or lost. A party was allowed
a certain percentage for waste, if the article entrusted had been wheat
(2| per cent.), barley (5 per cent.), or flax (10 per cent.). A vessel
must not be needlessly removed, nor any money entrusted diminish through
negligence. A banker, but not a private party, was allowed to use money
entrusted to him. The proprietor or keeper was answerable for damage
caused by his cattle, if the party injured had not exposed himself; but
where such injury could not have been foreseen, only half the actual
damage could be claimed, and that only from the value of the injuring
animal.

If a flock had been properly secured, the proprietor was not answerable
for its breaking loose and causing damage. If a fire originated from the
spark of an anvil, the party causing it was answerable. The master was
not answerable for any damage caused by his slaves. An article found in
a public place, if possessing any value, and characteristic marks by
which it might be recognized, was publicly described during three
festive occasions, and for seven days after the third of these feasts.
But letters of divorce, of manumission, testaments, conveyances, and
receipts, were not to be returned, as probably they had been purposely
thrown aside.

The criminal law of the Hebrews contrasts favorably, not only with that
of heathen, but also of many professedly Christian nations. Much stress
was laid by the Rabbins on the removal of ulterior consequences from the
criminal, so that the punishment was transformed from a harsh
reprobation and haughty exclusion into a kind and parental correction.
The death of the criminal or the infliction of forty stripes, which in
law took the place of the biblical threat of “ being cut off”,” was
supposed to atone for the crime of the penitent criminal, and to remove
the crime, both in this world and in that which is to come.

The crime ceased with the punishment. Hence the attempt to induce the
culprit to confess, the solemn and mournful conduct of the judges, and
the beautiful practice, on the part of the relatives of a felon, to wait
on the judges and witnesses, in order to show that they harbored no
ill-feeling towards them. Another equally peculiar provision of the law
was that by which no person could be executed or receive forty stripes,
unless the witnesses to the deed had warned the criminal, and he had
persevered in his sin.’ The punishments awarded by the Jewish law were
upon the life, body, and property of the criminal. Incarceration was not
a Jewish mode of punishment.

The law of Moses is explicit in the mention of those crimes to which the
punishment of death was to be awarded, but the Rabbinical statutes
limited its execution in various ways. In fact, every legal device was
employed to avoid this unpleasant necessity, and it was expressly stated
that the court which inflicted capital punishment more frequently than
once in seven, or, according to some, in seventy years, was cruel.
Rabbins Tarphon and Akiba declared they would never have consented to
such a sentence.

The Jewish law recognized four modes of execution. The party to be
**stoned** was cast by one of the witnesses from a height, after which
(if he was not dead) a second witness threw the first stone at him. If
this punishment had been inflicted for blasphemy or idolatry, the body
was hung up till even. There were different places of interment destined
for criminals, and their relatives were not to mourn for them.

**Burning** was generally executed by pouring boiling lead into the
criminal.

**Decapitation** was performed with the sword.

**Strangulation** was the ordinary punishment, and executed with a cord
wrapped in a cloth, and drawn together by two persons.

From the punishment threatened in John 8:5 we gather that the adulteress
there accused had not been actually married, but was only a bride. When
the criminal was led to the place of execution, which always took place
on the day of his condemnation, a herald going before him called upon
all who might be able to say anything in his favor to appear before the
judges, and the criminal was allowed to urge anything in his own behalf.
When near to the place of punishment, he was admonished to confess and
repent. On Sabbaths or feast-days, and on the days of preparation,
capital offences could not be tried. If the punishment of forty stripes
had been twice inflicted, the criminal was on a third occasion confined
into a narrow prison, and fed first upon very spare diet, then on barley
bread, until “his bowels gushed out.” Spare diet was also used when a
murderer escaped capital sentence through non-observance of any legal
form.

The different degrees of ecclesiastical censure were called Neziphah or
reproof, which lasted only for seven days, Niddui or Shammatha, denoting
a temporary excommunication, and Cherem or bann, that is, permanent
exclusion from the congregation. The punishments executed on the body of
the criminal consisted in the infliction of stripes, the largest number
being forty, or in practice thirty-nine, from a dread of inflicting one
in excess, it being always first ascertained that the culprit was able
to bear his sentence.

The instrument used was a scourge of leathern thongs. The hands of the
criminal, who was in an inclined position, were tied to a pillar, and
two-thirds of the stripes inflicted on the shoulders, the rest on the
chest. During the infliction, Deut. 28:58, 59; 29:9, and at the close
Ps. 78:38, were read to the criminal. Later Jewish writers recount 207
cases in which forty stripes were to be inflicted. The fines prescribed
in the law of Moses were so far modified by the Mishnah, that no actual
fine (only simple restitution) was required when the criminal confessed
his fault of his own accord. However, under no circumstances was an
individual incriminated by any statement of his own, nor could such be
used against him.

As a general principle, severe punishments were only inflicted where
amendment, restitution, etc., was in the nature of the thing impossible.
The Rabbins recount thirty -four breaches of forbids and two of commands
which expose to the threat of “ being cut off,” a punishment in their
opinion more severe than that of sudden death by the hand of God.
Corporal punishments were inflicted by the officers of the various
synagogues. In exceptional cases, the law warranted those present at the
perpetration of a crime to execute summary vengeance. In general, the
Jewish law assumed the innocence of every party till actual and
intentional guilt had been established, nor, while declaring the
rendering of testimony meritorious, did it oblige any person to lay
information.

The most fearful crime was that of blasphemy, which was only then
supposed to have been committed if the ineffable name of Jehovah had
been used. That name had originally been generally known, and was, in
certain defined circumstances, still pronounced. In cases of accusations
of blasphemy all present were removed, and the judges asked the
worthiest amongst the witnesses to repeat what they had heard; the
others simply assented. The judges then rent their garments in token of
mourning, and the convicted party was stoned.

The Mosaic law, which ordered the extermination of a city whose
inhabitants had become idolaters, was limited by the Rabbins to
instances in which the majority of the inhabitants had been seduced by
parties belonging to the same town and tribe. Direct acts of idolatry,
witchcraft, or having a familiar spirit, were punished by stoning;
intentional profanation of the Sabbath deserved stoning; the breach of
other ritual ordinances, forty stripes. A false prophet, Ie. one who
prophesied without having received a divine message, or who delivered
what had been sent by another prophet, or spoken in the name of a
strange god, was to be strangled.

The Rabbins also distinguished between casual and unintentional
homicide; manslaughter, where there had been an intention to hurt but
not to destroy; and murder, which implied premeditation and the
infliction of blows or wounds in themselves mortal, and from which
escape would have been impossible. Only in the last-mentioned case was
the murderer executed. During the investigation every party accused had
a right to go for safety to one of the cities of refuge, under the
escort of two Rabbins. If death issued in consequence of a quarrel and
fight, the murderer was executed if the blow given was in itself
sufficient to induce immediate death. Any person about to commit murder,
unnatural crimes, or to violate a bride, might lawfully be killed.

Where fatal injury had been sustained from an animal, the animal was
stoned; and the proprietor, if previously warned of its dangerous
character, had to pay the computed value of the party killed, and, in
the case of slaves, thirty shekels, whatever might be the real value of
the slave. If a murder was committed, and the perpetrator unknown, a
deputation, consisting of five members of the Sanhedrin, performed,
along with the elders of the township nearest to the place of murder,
certain prescribed solemnities, after which the latter were declared
free of the blame of official negligence. In cases of suicide the body
remained un-interred till even. Persons guilty of men-stealing were
strangled, if the party stolen had actually been brought within the
domain of the accused.

In cases of theft the punishment was restitution, with the addition of
double or five-fold the value of the article stolen. In order to
constitute theft, the article must have actually been lifted up or
removed from the boundaries of the owner. Thus a thief who killed and
then sold an animal on the property of its rightful owner was only bound
to make restitution. Nor did the law of compensation apply to the theft
of slaves, documents, immovable property, or things dedicated.’ A thief
who voluntarily confessed, under whatever circumstances, was only bound
to make restitution. If perjury had been committed to conceal the theft,
when the article stolen was restored, it must be accompanied by an
addition of one-fifth of its value, and handed to the proprietor in
person, and that however trifling the article or distant his place of
residence, so that his forgiveness might be obtained.

Tradesmen, as tailors, carpenters, etc., were interdicted from retaining
any of the material entrusted to them. To prevent temptation, it was
also forbidden to buy wool, milk, or young animals from a shepherd;
fruits or trees from a hired gardener, etc. If the thief had not the
means of paying the legal fine, he might be sold, but not beyond the
bounds of Palestine. Females could not be sold.

The witnesses who intentionally bore false witness were ordinarily
visited with the punishment which would have been awarded to the accused
party. In exceptional cases this was converted into a fine or the
infliction of forty stripes. Where the charge was capital, and sentence
had actually been pronounced, the witnesses were liable to death. The
various crimes connected with oaths were arranged into inconsiderate,
needless, and criminal swearing the latter when a party either denied
his knowledge of, or refused to mention a favorable circumstance and
perjury; all of which were more or less severely punished. In all these
cases a simple “ Amen,” in answer to adjuration, was deemed an oath.

Rabbinical ordinances, as in all other crimes so in respect of adultery
also, tended to lighten the law of Moses. The evidence of two witnesses
was requisite to establish the crime. If a woman had married again,
after having received false tidings of her husband’s death, both her
first and second husband had to divorce her with the loss of her dowry,
and the offspring of her second marriage Was deemed illegitimate. Rabbi
Jochanan ben Saccai abolished the practice of administering the waters
of jealousy, on account, as he said, of the frequency of adultery.’ This
mode of detection, which was supposed not to act immediately when the
woman’s merits partly atoned for her guilt, could only be used after the
husband had, in the presence of two witnesses, admonished his wife to
abstain from intercourse with a suspected party. One witness, even a
slave or a maid, was sufficient evidence in cases of actual adultery
after admonition, when a woman might be divorced with the loss of her
dowry, except when the witness against her was a near female relative of
her husband. In cases of seduction a threefold, in rape a fourfold fine
had to be paid. While the seducer was free, the father of the damsel
might in the latter case insist also on marriage, which could not again
be dissolved.

The strict biblical law concerning criminal resistance to parents was
almost rendered nugatory by Rabbinical additions. Thus the parents were
to be perfectly agreed in their accusation; neither of them was to be
decrepit, blind, deaf, lame, etc. The son must once before have been
judicially punished by stripes, and have reached the age of puberty;
finally, the law could only be applied during a period of about three
months. Cursing parents whether living or dead was punished by stoning;
striking, if traces of the ill usage had been left, by strangulation.
Insubordination to magistrates was severely punished, and, if committed
by a judge who had taught or acted against the decision of the Supreme
College, he was to be executed in Jerusalem, and at the time of one of
the feasts.

The office of judge was generally filled by the learned and doctors of
the Law. It had no immediate or necessary connection with the office of
teaching, and probably in small towns th& judges were often men who had
been chosen through the confidence of their fellow-citizens, but who had
never attained the position of a regularly ordained Rabbi.

Nevertheless, from the nature of the case, the ablest teachers were
generally selected as judges.

[After the fall of the Jewish State the influence of the Rabbins greatly
increased; and though there was no external power to enforce their
authority, it became more than ever the custom to appeal to their
decision in matters of dispute.]

The law distinguished three classes of judges, according to the size and
importance of the place in which they resided. The lowest court was that
of three, or possibly seven judges,’ the next that of the Sanhedrin of
twenty-three, and the highest that of seventy-one, or the Great
Sanhedrin. The judges of the highest court were regularly ordained by
the imposition of hands. This solemnity was performed by an ordained
Rabbi, in the presence of at least two others. The number of judges in
the various colleges of justice was uneven, in case of diversity of
opinion.

In a capital conviction, which could only be passed by a Sanhedrin, a
majority of at least two was requisite, and sentence was only pronounced
after a night spent in solemn deliberation had passed. In cases of
dubiety assessors might be chosen. Besides these colleges of regular
judges, parties might choose three judges or arbiters to decide in cases
of dispute. In Jerusalem, besides the Great Sanhedrin, there are said to
have been two other Sanhedrins of twenty-three. The power of appealing
to higher courts lay with the judges, if they were not sure of their
sentence, or in pecuniary matters with the accusing party. The judges
were not in receipt of any regular salary, but were compensated for any
loss of time.

Any communication with the parties, or favoritism, disqualified a judge
from pronouncing sentence. The candidates for the senatorial office were
required to be of good report, learned, grave, not engaged in any
degrading or sinful occupation, to be married and to have children, not
to be either too young or too old. Even the high-priest was subject to
the jurisdiction of the Sanhedrin, but kings were neither members of the
Sanhedrin nor subject to its authority. The regular times for meetings
of the local courts were the second and the fifth days of the week, but
it is not known whether this was also the case with the supreme
Sanhedrin at Jerusalem

The ordinary hours for the sitting of the court were from after the
morning sacrifice till the time of the meal. The judges were not allowed
to communicate to parties on which side they had voted.

Perfectly distinct from ordination to the office of judge was that to
the office of Rabbi or teacher, or, as it was expressed, for “loosing
and binding.” Sages set apart for one office were indeed generally
supposed to be qualified for the other also, but in theory and in
practice a distinction was made between the two. The Rabbi set apart “
to loose or bind “ might authoritatively declare what was binding on the
conscience and what not, and in Talmudical writings the phrase
continually recurs by which a teacher or a school is said to loose or to
hind, Ie. to declare something obligatory or non-obligatory a license or
ordination which was afterwards conferred by the Savior upon all His
disciples, acting under the guidance of His Holy Spirit.

In all criminal, and even in most civil cases, the testimony of at least
two witnesses was requisite. Parties interested, enemies, men or women
related to parties, minors, slaves, heathens, robbers, felons, usurers,
gamblers, and publicans, as well as idiots, etc., were incapable of
bearing witness. Witnesses were adjured by the parties at the bar; they
were strictly examined concerning the time, place, and circumstances of
the crime, and the slightest disagreement between them annulled the
whole testimony. If the judges did not understand the language of any of
the witnesses, they were not allowed to engage the services of an
interpreter, and, if dubious concerning their veracity, the case had to
be heard again before another court.

The law distinguished three kinds of oaths which might be exacted from
the parties at the bar, that according to Biblical, according to
Mishnic, and according to Gemaric ordinance. The **first** was made by a
party suspected of unfaithfulness, by a defendant who had admitted a
claim in part, and by one against whom only one witness had testified.
The **second** was made by the pursuer in a cause where other sufficient
proof was wanting. The **third** form of oath was introduced at a later
period for all other disputed cases, and for testing witnesses.

Finally, a legal provision denominated “Miggo,” in consideration of,
declared that a favorable presumption attended the party who admitted a
fact, which, if fraud had been intended, might have been concealed by
him.

We have already hinted that the priests themselves attended to the
duties of temple police, and decided in all purely priestly questions.
Any further details on this subject would necessarily lead us to an
extended sketch of a former period. We therefore close this account of
the state of the Hebrew nation by a brief exposition of their Theology,
with its kindred sciences.

It has already been hinted more than once that the law laid down in the
Mishnah frequently represents the theories and speculations of the
Jewish doctors of the second century, and not the actual practice of any
given period. Several of their regulations deal accordingly with
obsolete customs, and have little regard to the actual circumstances of
the time. The truth of this statement may be illustrated by sundry
passages in the above sketch of the traditional law, as, for example,
the principles laid down respecting the nations of Canaan and the
Noachic Commandments, the jubilee, the cities of refuge, the king, and
the penalty of death. When Judea became a Roman province, the power of
life and death was taken away from the Jewish courts.
