**Armageddon 9**

**Armageddon**

The word armageddon is the Greek form of the Hebrew har megiddo, which
means the hill or city of Megiddo, and is a hill which is at the
southern end of the plain of Esdraelon also called Jezreel. This is the
great plain that intersects Palestine immediately north of Carmel. It
was here that Deborah and Barak defeated the Canaanites (Judges 4:15)
and that Gideon defeated the Midianites (Judges 7). Additionally, this
is where King Saul died in battle against the Philistines, at the battle
of Gilboa (I Samuel 31:8), and where Josiah died in battle against the
Egyptians under the command of Pharaoh Necho (II Kings 23:29, 30; II
Chronicles 35:22). Napoleon said that all the armies of the world could
maneuver on this plain at the same time.

Our Lord spoke of the tribulation in his dialogue on the Mount of
Olives, commonly called the Olivet Discourse. Matthew 24:21, 22, read,
“For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of
the world until now and never to be equaled again. If those days had not
been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect
those days will be shortened.”

So here in the NIV translation the phrase great distress refers to the
tribulation. Jeremiah 30:4-7 calls the tribulation “the time of Jacob’s
trouble” and compares it to a female’s birth pangs. Ezekiel 20:34-38
calls the tribulation that time when Israel will “pass under the rod.”
Ezekiel 22:19-22, Zechariah 13:9 and Malachi 3:1-3 call the tribulation
God’s melting pot. Isaiah 10:5, 13:5, 26:20 and Daniel 8:19 call the
tribulation the indignation. In Daniel 9:20-27, the tribulation is
called Daniel’s seventieth week. Here, each week is a prophetic week and
each week refers to seven years which is a total of 490 years. The 490
year time span began in 445 B.C. (Nehemiah 2:1, 5, 6). And 483 years
later (sixty- nine of the seventy weeks are complete), our Lord rode
into Jerusalem and was hailed as the promised Son of David (Matthew
21:8, 9). This was Palm Sunday. [1]

Thus, it can be seen that after the cross one week (the seventieth week
of Daniel), or seven years, still remains to the Jews. Between week
sixty-nine and seventy, God has inserted the present church age. This
church age exists to call out the bride of Christ, because as He is
seated at the right hand of God, the God man is alone in his human
portion. Thus a royal bride and royal family is being called out for
Him. He, takes precedence over all, thus this interruption of history is
not unusual. But the final seven years remain as Daniel’s seventieth
week. This is the tribulation!

The tribulation is also the time of Satan’s recklessness, what Pastor
Robert Thieme, Jr. has called the time of Satan’s desperation. This is
because Satan knows doctrine and knows that his time is running out.
Exacerbating the problems are two other factors:

1. The removal of the church age believers at the rapture of the Church,
I Thessalonians 4:13-18.

2. The removal of the restraining ministry of God the Holy Spirit, II
Thessalonians 2:6, 7. [2]

The seven years of the tribulation will be divided in half. The first
half is a period of political maneuvers by four power seats, called the
kings of the north, south, east and west in the Bible. During this first
half, anti Jewish sentiments will be prevalent and crime will
predominate. The second half of the tribulation is characterized by
Satan’s attempt to destroy Palestine, Jerusalem and the Jews. To
accomplish this, he causes the four power seats to converge on
Jerusalem.

The Four Power Seats

Joel 1:6 introduced the prophecy of the king of the north. Daniel 11:40
also refers to the king of the north, and calls this king of the north
the king of fierce countenance in Daniel 8:23. Isaiah 10:24 calls him
the Assyrian, and the overflowing scourge in Isaiah 28:15. In Ezekiel
38:2 and 39:1, he is called Gog of the land of Magog. It is important
not to confuse this phrase with the Gog and Magog of Revelation 20:8,
which refers to all of Satan’s gentile proselyte followers at the end of
the millennium and their rebellion.

The kings of the east are referred to in Daniel 11:44, and are called
the kings of the sun rising in Revelation 16:12.

The king of the west refers to the ruler or dictator of the revived
Roman Empire.

Revelation 16:13 states, “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs
come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast,
and out of the mouth of the false prophet.” This verse explains the evil
motivations of the various kings, north, south, east and west. The three
unclean spirits are kosmokrator demons and are referred to in Daniel
10:13. These demons, at the command of Satan, possess political leaders
so that Satan’s plans might reach fruition.

The dragon is Satan himself. Satan himself empowers the king of the
west, also called the man of sin, and referred to in II Thessalonians
2:4. Revelation 12:7-9 identifies Satan as the dragon.

The beast is referred to in Revelation 13:1, 2, where he is called the
beast out of the sea. He is called the feet of the image in Daniel
2:31-45, and the little horn in Daniel 7:8, also the prince that shall
come in Daniel 9:26, 27, and the god of forces in Daniel 11:38, the man
of sin in II Thessalonians 2:3-10, and the scarlet beast in Revelation
17:3. He is, then, the king of the west, the ruler of the revived Roman
Empire. He has ten horns in Daniel 7:7, 8, 23, 24; these horns denote
his power over a ten nation entity called the revived Roman Empire. He
is also the religious leader of this ten nation entity. In Revelation
17:2-12 he, the king of the west, is the seventh head or mountain. The
seven heads are those nations throughout history who have attacked
Israel: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome and the future
king of the west, the revived Roman Empire. And as the seventh head he
is the beast or little horn found in Daniel 7:8, 24, where he gains
control over three horns or nations of the ten horns or nations and thus
comes to rule all ten nations and form the revived Roman Empire. [3]

And Revelation 13:7 says that the beast will be given permission to
persecute the saints and to kill them. And he will, according to
Revelation 17:14, make war on the Lamb of God, our Lord Jesus Christ,
who will destroy him at Armageddon.

The false prophet is described in Revelation 13:11, “And I saw another
beast coming up out of the land; and he had two horns like a lamb, and
he spoke as a dragon.” This is the false prophet of Revelation 19:20,
20:10; he is the ruler of the Jews in the tribulation. He is also called
the willful king in Daniel 11:36-40, and the idol shepherd in Zechariah
11:15-17. He comes out of the land (Palestine or Israel) while the first
beast came out of the sea (the Gentile nations). This false prophet
comes in the form of a lamb, i.e., he presents himself as the Messiah
which he is not! That is why he is false! His two horns speak of his two
false Messianic claims which are king and prophet. This second beast or
false prophet is empowered by Satan and deceives by miracles and directs
the Jews to worship the first beast, the king of the west, according to
Revelation 13:12-18. Again, this is why he is called the false prophet;
and his is the number 666. [4]

The Abomination of Desolation

At the beginning of the tribulation, the false prophet, the ruler of the
Jews in Israel makes a pact with the king of the west (the beast out of
the sea). He does this in hopes of preserving his power. However, in the
middle of the tribulation (the seventieh week, the last seven years of
the age of Israel), the king of the west, who is possessed by Satan
himself, abrogates the pact. He, the king of the west, demands that he
be worshipped as God and that all Jewish forms of worship cease (Daniel
12:11). This is when the abomination of desolation, which is a statue of
the king of the west, is erected in the Temple in the Holy of Holies
(Revelation 13:15).

The erection of this statue is a sign to the Jewish believers of the
tribulation. They are to flee to the mountains. Matthew 24:15 and 16
say, “When you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel
the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads these words let him
understand them) then let those who are in Judaea flee into the
mountains.”

Revelation 12:14 says, “And to the woman (Israel) were given two wings
of a great eagle (divine protection from God), so that she might fly
into the wilderness, into her place, where she is safe for a time (one
year), and times (two years), and half a time (one-half a year), from
the face of the serpent.”

World War and the Battle of Armageddon

Daniel 11:40, reads, “And at the time of the end shall the king of the
south push (make war) at him (false prophet, the ruler of the Jews): and
the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with
chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he (the king of
the north) shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass
over them.”

We see then that the king of the southern power seat decides to attack
Palestine. Simultaneously, the king of the north is moving through the
Middle East on his way to engulf Africa. The king of the north has both
land armies and navies at his command. The phrase overflow and pass
through seems to indicate that the king of the north moves quickly and
decisively through the area. [5]

Daniel 11:41 reads, “He (the king of the north) shall invade also into
the Beautiful Land (middle east), and many countries (including Israel)
shall be conquered: but these (Jewish believers) shall escape out of his
hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.”

Since the military goal of the king of the north is north Africa, Egypt,
he passes rapidly through Palestine. Thus, those Jews who obeyed Matthew
24:16, and fled to the mountains, remain in safety.

Daniel 11:42 reads, “He (the king of the north) will shall stretch forth
his hand also upon the countries (of north Africa): and the land of
Egypt will not escape.” He takes Egypt.

Daniel 11:43 reads, “But he shall have power over the treasures of gold
and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the
Libyans (his naval forces from the Mediterranean and the west) and the
Ethiopians (his land armies driving toward central Africa) shall be at
his steps.” So the king of the north, also called Gog (Ezekiel 38:2), is
ready to conqueror Africa when God intervenes.

Revelation 16:12 says, “And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the
great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way
of the kings of the east might be prepared.” The kings of the east now
enter Palestine.

Daniel 11:44 reads, “But tidings out of the east and out of the north
shall trouble him: therefore he (the king of the north) will go forth
with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away (to wipe out) many
(the Jews in Jerusalem).”

So we have the armies of the kings of the east penetrating to Idumea
(Isaiah 63), and we have the king of the south entering Palestine; and
to the north, in the valley of Esdraelon, the army of the king of the
west (revived Roman Empire) is descending upon Jerusalem.

So the king of the north, who is down in Africa, must reverse his line
of march and return to Palestine so that he might protect his lines of
supply. So with great fury he turns for Jerusalem. Remember, the king of
the west seeks to protect his statue in the Holy of Holies.

Daniel 11:45 says, “And he (the king of the north) will plant the
tabernacles of his palace (his army headquarters) between the seas in
the glorious Holy Mountain (Zion); yet he will come to his end, and none
shall help him.” So we see that he returns to Palestine and sets up
headquarters on the western escarpment of Jerusalem.

Joel 2:2-9 describes the king of the north’s attack on Jerusalem. It is
like the attack of the locust infestations which is devastating. The
king of the north contacts great prosperity, but leaves only desolation
behind, just as the locusts, and just as Satan in the original garden of
Eden.

Thus we have the four power seats of the future, north, south, east and
west; the armies of the entire world are descending upon Jerusalem.

Zechariah 12 relates the attack against the Jerusalem of the tribulation
from the perspective of the believing Jews living and fighting in
Jerusalem.

Zechariah 12:2 says, “Behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of intoxication
to all the people (the four armies) round about, when they shall be in
the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.” Here, the Jews are
depicted as a cup of strong wine; the invading armies will drink of this
wine and become intoxicated. This wine is the wrath of God poured out
upon these armies.

Zechariah 12:3 says, “And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome
stone for all people (the four armies): all that burden themselves with
it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be
gathered against it.”

Zechariah 14:1 and 2 state, “Behold the day of the Lord approaches, and
your wealth will be divided in the middle of you. For I will gather all
nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and
the houses rifled, and the women raped; and half of the city shall go
forth into captivity (unbelieving Jews), but the residue of the people
(the believing remnant) will not be cut off from the city (they will be
safe).”

Remember, Jesus Christ controls history. [6] He allows this to happen.

Zechariah 12:5 and 6 say, “And the governors of Judah will say in their
heart, the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be my strength in the Lord of
the armies (hosts) their God. In that day will I make the governors of
Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in
a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right
hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own
place, even in Jerusalem.” These governors, then, are believers and
those who stand with them are believing Jews. They stand and fight,
trusting in God.

Remember, the king of the north is on the western escarpment of the
city; the king of the west is on the valley of Megiddo in the plain of
Esdraelon. The kings of the east are on Jehoshaphat’s valley to the
east, and scripture does not relate where the kings of the south are.

Then when the world is attacking the believing Jews and all hope is lost
then comes a supernatural darkness! Matthew 24:29 says, “Immediately
after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the
moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and
the powers of the heavens will be shaken.” Isaiah 60:2, says, “For,
behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the
people…”

Zechariah 12:4 says, “In that day (the day of the Lord), saith the Lord,
I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with shock: and I
will open my eyes (divine favor and blessing) upon the house of Judah,
and will strike every horse of the people with blindness.” Total
darkness and total confusion of the four armies. No one can see, no
computers work, no information is available and men begin to go mad with
fear.

Isaiah 13:6-9, compared with Luke 21:25 and 26 says, “Howl; for the day
of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the
Almighty. Therefore will all hands be faint, and every man’s heart will
melt: and they will be afraid: pangs and sorrows will take hold of them;
they will be in pain as a woman in child-bearing: they will be amazed at
each other (total shock); their faces shall be as flames. Behold the day
of the Lord comes, cruel both with wrath and anger, lay the land
desolate; and he shall destroy the sinners on it.”

Just as the darkness of the cross provided salvation for all believers,
so this darkness preserves the Jewish believers of the tribulation.

Then, unexpectedly and suddenly, from within the all encompassing
supernatural darkness, there appears the only thing that can pierce such
darkness is supernatural light. Zechariah 14:6 and 7 put it thusly, “On
that day there will be no light, no cold or frost. It will be a unique
day, without daytime or nighttime (no light whatsoever) which is a day
known only to the Lord. When evening comes (that time of day at which
evening would normally occur), there will be light.”

And Psalm 97:2-6 describe that day, the day of the Lord, as follows:
“Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are
the habitation of his throne. A fire goes in front of him, and burns up
his enemies round about. His lightnings light up the world: the earth
saw, and trembled. The hills melted like wax at the presence of the
Lord….and all the people see His glory.”

Revelation 1:7 describes our Lord’s return: “Look, he is coming with the
clouds (saints in their resurrection bodies), and every eye will see
him, even those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will
mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen.”

So we see that as our Lord descends from the third heaven, the abode of
God, everyone will see him, for His is the Light of the world. Christ
himself said in John 8:12, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows
(believes) me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of
life.”

This supernatural light, visible to all, is the return of our Lord at
the second advent. He returns to render judgment. Zechariah 14:3 says,
“Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights
in the day of battle.”

The Lord will fight and deliver! For just as Moses said at the Red Sea,
“Stand and watch the deliverance of the Lord!” (Exodus 14:13) Just as
the Jews were delivered at the Red Sea in Exodus 14:10-14, so will the
believers of the tribulation generation be delivered. Zechariah 14:4
states, “On that day (the day of the Lord, the Second Advent) his feet
will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of
Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley,
with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south.”
Therefore, just as the Red Sea parted so Moses and the Exodus generation
could escape, so will the Mount of Olives part. The Mount of Olives is
the first place that His feet will touch the earth and it will part and
the believers in Jerusalem during the tribulation that are fighting
against overwhelming odds will escape in the valley created by the
rending asunder of the mountain. [7]

Here is the return of the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, the
Ancient of Days, the stone cut without hands, David’s greater son, the
lion of the tribe of Judah. Revelation 19:11-16 speak eloquently of His
coming: "I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white
horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges
and makes war. His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many
crowns. He has a

name written on him that no one but he himself knows. He is dressed in a
robe dipped in blood, and his name is The Word of God. The armies of
heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine
linen, white and clean. Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which
to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron scepter. He
treads the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. On his
robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD
OF LORDS."

Throughout the ancient world the white horse was the symbol of conquest
and victory. He is true to His word and faithful, and He will deliver
His own, both believing Jews and believing Gentiles. He does this
through righteous judgment, violence and death.

His judgments are correct, right, just and true! Those that are judged
at this future day are unbelievers who have, without exception, had each
and every chance to believe, but who have rejected Him repeatedly.

The armies that accompany Him at his return are the elect angels, the
Old Testament saints, those saints who have died or martyred during the
tribulation, and the saints of the church age. References to these
groups are found in I Thessalonians 3:13 and Jude 14. All these saints
will stand and watch. Our Lord Jesus Christ will do all the fighting and
all the judging. His only weapon is the sharp sword of Revelation 19:15;
this sword is His spoken word. The wine press refers to the tremendous
crushing power of these words: the devastation is total and complete.

Continuing in Revelation 19:17, “And I saw an angel standing in the sun;
and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the
midst of heaven (the first heaven - the atmosphere which surrounds the
earth), Come and gather yourselves together at the supper of the great
God.” This angel announces the destruction of the beast and all his
allies. The angel calls those carrion birds such as vultures to prepare
for a feast of dead bodies. Ezekiel 39, the entire chapter, and
specifically verses 17-22, provide the prophet’s description of this
scene. There is no doubt as to the outcome of the battle in the angel’s
mind; indeed, he is so sure that he commands the vultures to gather
before the battle takes place.

Revelation 19:19 says, “And I saw the beast (king of the west - the
revived Roman Empire), and the kings of the earth, and their armies,
gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and
against his army.” Here we have the culmination of the work of the three
frog spirits of Revelation 16:13: They have gathered together the four
power seats to do battle. Remember, these four kings and their armies
have been fighting each other for control of the world and Palestine.
Now, faced with the great Lamb of God, they unite with another to fight
against God. They suffer what II Thessalonians 2:11 calls “strong
delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all might be
damned…” Thus, these four armies now prepare to war with God Himself;
their absolute arrogance fuels their belief that they can defeat God.
Psalm 2:1-3 describes their thoughts: “The heathen rage, and the people
imagine a vain thing. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the
rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against His anointed.”

Isaiah 63:1-6 describes the short lived battle: “Who is this coming from
Edom, from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? Who is this, robed
in splendor, striding forward in the greatness of his strength? ‘It is
I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save (the Jewish remnant of
believers and any Gentile believers).’ Why are your garments red, like
those of one treading the wine press? ’I have trodden the wine press
alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger
and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I
stained all my clothing. For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and
the year of my redemption has come. I looked, but there was no one to
help, I was appalled that no one gave support; so my own arm worked
salvation for me, and my own wrath sustained me. I trampled the nations
in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the
ground.”

Revelation 19:20 tells the final end of the dictators: ”The beast (king
of the west) was taken, and with him the false prophet (dictator of
Israel) that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them
that received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image
(the abomination of desolation which is the placement of a statue of the
king of the west in the Holy of Holies in the rebuilt third Temple in
Jerusalem. These both were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with
brimstone." The armies are slain and defeated and the two dictators are
cast alive into the lake of fire.

As we have already seen in Isaiah 63, so widespread is the slaughter
that our Lord’s garments of white are stained red with the blood of His
enemies. Revelation 14:19 and 20 describe the extent of the carnage:
“The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw
them into the great wine press of God’s wrath. They were trampled in the
wine press outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising
as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1600 stadia (180
miles).” The blood runs five to six feet high for a distance of 180
miles.

Many flounder at this picture of our Lord. “And ask, in amazement,
whether the author really believes it? We answer, Yes!” [8] For at the
first advent He came in humiliation to provide salvation; then, at the
tribulation, however, He will come in glory. This is stated in Psalm
45:3-6: “Gird your sword upon your side, O mighty one; clothe yourself
with splendor and majesty. In your majesty ride forth victoriously in
behalf of truth, humility and righteousness; let your right hand display
awesome deeds. Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s
enemies; let the nations fall beneath your feet. Your throne, O God,
will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of
your kingdom.”

So the entire picture is that of judgment and vengeance. Our Lord
Himself spoke of this day in Luke 19:27, where He said, “But those
enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them, bring them
here and kill them in front of me.”

There are so many dead enemies of our Lord that scripture relates that
it takes seven months to bury all the bodies. Ezekiel 39:12 says, “For
seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to
cleanse the land.”

Summary of Armageddon

The day of the Lord or the day of Jehovah or the great day of God, then,
occurs in the final days of the tribulation, which is the final seven
years of the age of Israel (Daniel’s seventieth week). Christ returns to
fulfill the promises to Israel made in the Abrahamic, Palestinian,
Davidic and New Covenants to Israel. The location of this last great
battle is in Palestine, specifically in Armageddon (valley of Megiddo),
the Jeshoshaphat valley, Edom (Idumea) and the city of Jerusalem.

Because of demon possession and empowerment by Satan himself, the four
power seats of the future descend with their armies upon Jerusalem. And
these four power seats are called the kings of the north, the south, the
east and the west in the Bible.

Then the second advent of Christ occurs; He destroys the invading armies
who unite to make war with Him. The two beasts (the dictator of the
revived Roman Empire, also called the king of the west; and the false
prophet, the dictator of Israel) are cast alive into the lake of fire
for eternity. Then Satan himself is bound and thrown into the abyss, and
the great white throne judgment takes place. Our Lord rules on the earth
for 1000 years, which time is called the millennium.

Is the tribulation close? The Bible states that there is no prophecy
that must be fulfilled before the rapture of the church takes place.
However, this has been true since the death of the apostles. “. . . no
one knows the day or the hour . . .” (Mark 13:32) Thus no accurate
forecast may be made or supported. Remember the church will not go
through the tribulation; the rapture of the church precedes the
tribulation.

Who is the beast? Who is the false prophet? Again, no one knows for
sure. Their identities cannot be stated. Also, many world leaders in the
past have been marked as the beast and the Anti-Christ, including
Napoleon, Hitler, the Pope and Mussolini.

Finally, for the church age believer God has a plan (Ephesians 3:20). As
we have just seen, He is faithful and true. He is faithful to His
promises and true to fulfill His warnings of judgment.
