*Acts 2:38, “Then Peter said unto them, “Repent, and be baptized every
one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and
you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”*

This is one of the Bible’s most controversial verses; many systems of
false religion have been built on it. The most prominent is the concept
of baptismal regeneration, the idea that water baptism is required for
salvation. Baptismal regeneration is the most widely taught form of
salvation legalism, the idea that a person can actually do something
like be baptized to help save himself.

Any ritual involving human activity, human merit, human works like water
baptism is a ritual in which someone is doing something.

Works or whatever they are, are not accepted by God as contributing to a
person’s salvation.

“**For by grace are you saved, through faith; and that not of
yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should
boast.” (Eph. 2:8, 9)**

“**Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to
his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of
the Holy Spirit,” (Titus 3:5)**

Repent

The English word repent is from Latin, re + poenitere, meaning to
regret; to be sorry. The Oxford English Dictionary has the following
meanings:

1. To affect oneself with contrition as regret for something done or for
something inherently wrong, some fault, misconduct, sin, or other
offense.

2. To feel contrition, compunction, sorrow or regret.

3. To change one’s mind with regard to past action or conduct through
dissatisfaction with it or its results.

You can see that peoples’ opinions of what is required for salvation is
colored by which of the above definitions they chose. That is, if you
choose number one or number two you could assume that, in order to
properly repent, you must feel great sorrow or regret for your sins.

Now, regret can range from a mild regret to a life-threatening sorrow. A
mild regret says, “Oh, I see I’ve been wrong; I’ll do it the other way.”
A severe regret is a raging sorrow which can destroy one emotionally and
physically, as from some unintentional action that harms a loved one.

So, a person may feel a tremendous regret about sin: the offense to God,
the effect on others, etc. A person may not know enough about sin, or
its consequences, to have much regret at all. For many people, the first
they hear about sin is in an evangelistic message or Bible class.

For example, someone who grows up in a permissive family in a permissive
society may not know that sex outside of marriage is a sin and has very
bad consequences. It takes Bible doctrine to know sin for what it is!

Regret over past sins actually grows as one is edified, as a person
gains divine viewpoint and sees real issues in life. If a believer
doesn’t learn about forgiveness, confession and restoration to
fellowship, he might build up a tremendous guilt complex about his past.
This is why it is such a blessing to know that past sins have been
forgiven. “As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed
our transgressions from us.” Psalm 103:12

Now if repentance is feeling sorry for sin, then how sorry do you have
to feel? Mild sorrow or raging sorrow? How do you demonstrate this
sorrow to God? These thoughts lead people into such extremes as
asceticism and self-punishment of one kind or another great attempts to
impress God, and other people, with the extent of one’s contrition.

Another question arises from this, Will I have to wait until the end of
my life, or until I face God, to know whether my sorrow has been enough?

What about my lack of knowledge of sins? How many sins are there that I
do not even know about? How much sorrow must I have about each type and
variety? Must I feel as sorry for gossip as I would for murder?

The question here, of course, is works. Can repentance be misconstrued
to support a works doctrine? Yes it can, **if feeling sorry is made a
necessary constituent of salvation**. Just as in all forms of legalism,
there is great potential here for bullying by clergy and informed
laymen.

Definition number three, on the other hand, taken alone, indicates that
repentance can be just a mental change that does not necessarily involve
emotional sorrow.

To resolve these vocabulary problems, the Greek word must be studied.

The Greek for repent is **metanoeo**, which means to change the mind; to
rethink something. The cognate noun **metanoia**, Rom 2:4, means a
change of mind; a conversion; a turning away. Divine viewpoint changes
every bit of human viewpoint you have learned.

There is no emotion or feeling involved in this activity. Therefore, if
we are going to use the English word repent to translate **metanoeo**,
we must be certain that the English definition number three above is
meant!

**Metanoeo**, as an active verb, needs to have an object in context. One
must change one’s mind about something. You might change your mind
because of an honest mistake. You bought a Ferrari and now you can not
pay for it. You may receive some education and that changes your
thinking about many things.

Repentance is a theological concept we study to explain the mechanics
which occur at salvation.

If you have accepted Christ as savior, at some point you changed your
thinking about your sin, your relationship to God, and about the work of
Christ for salvation.

Likewise, f you have studied the Bible as a Christian, the word of God
has led you to change your mind about many things.

“**That you put off concerning the former manner of life the old man,
which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,”**

“**and be renewed in the spirit of your mind;”**

“**and that you put on the new man, which after God is created in
righteousness and true holiness.” (Eph. 4:22-24)**

When you decide to commit a sin, you are certainly not thinking divine
viewpoint. When you are convicted by the word of God, and by the Holy
Spirit, you have an opportunity to adjust your thinking to God’s point
of view. This leads to your confession, expressing the same viewpoint as
God. Before you confess your sin, you first undergo a change of thinking
about the sin. Metanoeo precedes homologeo.

Repentance is not a turning away from sin in order to accomplish
salvation. A person is guilty of sin; he does need forgiveness; and he
should stop sinning. But, victory over sin is a process of the Christian
life.

An unbeliever cannot have victory over sin. A person can turn over a new
leaf, clean up in a few surface areas, spruce up the facade a little.
But who would a person be satisfying. One might fool himself and others
that he had done enough if he did not have a very good idea of what
God’s demands actually are.

Sin is too pervasive; there are too many sins. Mental attitude sins,
sins of the tongue, open and public sins. You can not turn away from all
your sins, even temporarily.

You can see what a vicious circle the legalist is in, the one who thinks
he can lose his salvation. If it were possible to lose salvation,
assuming someone were successful in earning it in the first place,
salvation could never be maintained.

Let us compare Acts 2:38 and Acts 16:31, in which the Philippian jailer
is told simply to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.

We can see that believe (**pistueo**) and repent (**metanoeo**) are
virtually synonymous in their application.

-   Both require focusing one’s attention on Christ.

-   Both require positive volition to the gospel.

-   Both require acceptance of divine viewpoint regarding Christ and His
    work on the cross.

-   Both mean that you have information that you did not have before and
    that you accept a point of view.

-   Both mental attitudes are non meritorious, that is, neither involves
    any sort of works.

The Jew, however, is going to have a more wrenching experience as he
turns from his religion to Christ. Repentance means that, however much
he loves his religion and follows his religious practices, he no longer
trusts in the works of his religion to save him. He trusts Christ.

The Philippian jailer has no such hold over his mind. He accepts Christ
readily, with no religious reservations. He is simply a man in trouble
grasping at a straw which turns out to be a lifeboat.

When witnessing, you only give information, you do not try to get the
unbeliever to repent. That is the function of God the Holy Spirit using
the gospel information you have provided. God the Holy Spirit will
encourage people to change their mind about Christ. Whether a person
actually does repent depends on that person’s volition when hearing the
gospel message.

Regret in the New Testament

There is a Greek word for regret, **metamelomai**, which should always
be translated regret, never repent, because it has an emotional
connotation. It means to feel sorry for something you have done.

It is used to express regret for a previous action (Matt. 21:29-31).

It describes the attitude of Judas Iscariot (Matt. 27:3) where he
regretted what he had done to our Lord, but he never repented, he never
believed in our Lord for salvation.

It is used for God having no regrets about saving people and giving
spiritual gifts in the church age, (Rom. 11:29).

Likewise, the Father has no regrets regarding the appointment of Jesus
Christ as our high priest, (Heb. 7:21).

Illustrations of Repentance

Exo. 13:17. The Jews were not mentally prepared to fight for their
freedom. God knew they would change their minds, say that slavery is
better, and attempt to go back to Egypt, if they saw war coming. So here
repentance means to come up to a new set of facts, be influenced by
these facts rationally, and then to retreat.

Jer. 8:3-6, speaks of Judah. When you fail, you do not quit or give up.
You get up and move on. When a person does not repent with regard to
salvation also an unbeliever, or Bible doctrine called a believer, then
your lifestyle is out of control due to evil in your life.

Believing in Christ: Repentance for Salvation

Salvation repentance is that change of mind which occurs when a person
understands and believes the gospel.

This is the principle of common grace, in which the Holy Spirit takes
the message of the witness and makes it a reality in the mind of the
unbeliever.

An unbeliever cannot understand spiritual phenomena, 1 Cor. 2:14.

Therefore the Holy Spirit acts to bring about the perception of the
gospel, John 16:8-11; 2 Tim. 2:25.

After understanding the issues of the gospel, a positive volition
expresses itself in a change of mental attitude: faith in Christ. Faith
in Christ and repentance are two sides of the same coin. A change in
mental attitude about the person and work of Christ equals repentance.

Repentance results in faith in Jesus Christ, salvation adjustment to the
justice of God. And it is at the moment of repentance that God the
Father provides the whole salvation package to the new believer.

Topic: Salvation Doctrines

Mark 1:14-15 teaches that first you change your mind about Christ and
then you believe. Read Matt. 12:41; Luke 13:2-3, 5; 15:7, 10; Acts
17:30; 20:21; 26:20; Rom. 2:4; Heb. 12:17.

2 Pet. 3:9, “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but
for all to come to repentance.”

Growth in the Christian life demands repentance toward human good, Heb.
6:1.

Human good is good works produced by any person, Christian or
non-Christian, apart from the filling and control of the indwelling Holy
Spirit.

An unbeliever, of course, does not have the indwelling Holy Spirit, and
cannot be filled with the Spirit. All good produced by an unbeliever is
categorized as human good.

A Christian is, at any moment, either filled with the Holy Spirit
defined as spiritual or not filled with the Spirit also called carnal.

The good produced by a spiritual believer is divine good defined as
gold, silver and precious stones. The good produces by a carnal believer
is human good also called wood, hay and stubble.

-   Human good is dead to the plan and policy of God, Gen. 2:17.

-   Human good is linked with arrogance and produces boasting, Eph. 2:9;
    Rom. 4:2.

-   Human good is never acceptable to God, Isaiah 64:6.

-   Human good will not save man, Eph. 2:8-9.

-   An unbeliever’s human good will be judged, Rev. 20:12-15.

-   The believer’s human good will be judged at the judgment seat of
    Christ, 1 Cor. 3:11-16; Rom 5:10; 2 Cor 5:10.

A change of attitude about sin is taught in Rev. 2:5, 16, 22.

A change of attitude toward Bible truth is the basis for recovery from
backsliding, Rom. 2:5; Rev. 3:19.

When God Repents

In the Bible, God is said to repent of things. Read Gen. 6:6; Exo.
32:11-14; 1 Sam. 15:35; Psalm 90:11-13.

But God is immutable and does not change. He does not change His mind.
Therefore, these passages ascribe to God a human characteristic, in
order to explain or describe God’s judgment in a human frame of
references. This is an anthropopathism.

An anthropopathism ascribes to God a human characteristic He does not
possess, but explains divine policy in terms of human frame of
reference.
