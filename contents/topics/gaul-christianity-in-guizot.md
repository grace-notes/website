**Christianity in Gaul8**

Christianity in Gaul
--------------------

This article is taken from **The History of France**, by Maurice Guizot,
Chapter 6, *Establishment of Christianity in Gaul*.

This brief account of how the Lord moved men and women of faith to
spread the message of Christ to the countries of France, Germany,
Belgium, Switzerland, and others, is an amazing testimony to the grace
of God and the constancy of the believers’ faith. Also very interesting
are the descriptions of the two main heathen religions in Gaul, Roman
paganism and Druidism; and Guizot presents a good comparison of these
with Christianity.

When Christianity began to penetrate into Gaul, it encountered there two
religions very different one from the other, and infinitely more
different from the Christian religion; these were Druidism and Paganism–
hostile one to the other, but with a hostility political only, and
unconnected with those really religious questions that Christianity was
coming to raise.

Druidism, considered as a religion, was a mass of confusion, wherein the
instinctive notions of the human race concerning the origin and destiny
of the world and of mankind were mingled with the Oriental dreams of
metempsychosis–that pretended transmigration, at successive periods, of
immortal souls into divers creatures. This confusion was worse
confounded by traditions borrowed from the mythologies of the East and
the North, by shadowy remnants of a symbolical worship paid to the
material forces of nature, and by barbaric practices, such as human
sacrifices, in honor of the gods or of the dead. People who are without
the scientific development of language and the art of writing do not
attain to systematic and productive religious creeds. There is nothing
to show that, from the first appearance of the Gauls in history to their
struggle with victorious Rome, the religious influence of Druidism had
caused any notable progress to be made in Gallic manners and
civilization. A general and strong, but vague and incoherent, belief in
the immortality of the soul was its noblest characteristic. But with the
religious elements, at the same time coarse and mystical, were united
two facts of importance: the Druids formed a veritable ecclesiastical
corporation, which had, throughout Gallic society, fixed attributes,
special manners and customs, an existence at the same time distinct and
national; and in the wars with Rome this corporation became the most
faithful representatives and the most persistent defenders of Gallic
independence and nationality. The Druids were far more a clergy than
Druidism was a religion; but it was an organized and a patriotic clergy.
It was especially on this account that they exercised in Gaul an
influence which was still existent, particularly in north-western Gaul,
at the time when Christianity reached the Gallic provinces of the south
and centre.

The Greco-Roman Paganism was, at this time, far more powerful than
Druidism in Gaul, and yet more lukewarm and destitute of all religious
vitality. It was the religion of the conquerors and of the state, and
was invested, in that quality, with real power; but, beyond that, it had
but the power derived from popular customs and superstitions. As a
religious creed, the Latin Paganism was at bottom empty, indifferent,
and inclined to tolerate all religions in the state, provided only that
they, in their turn, were indifferent at any rate towards itself, and
that they did not come troubling the state, either by disobeying her
rulers or by attacking her old deities, dead and buried beneath their
own still standing altars.

Such were the two religions with which, in Gaul, nascent Christianity
had to contend. Compared with them it was, to all appearance, very small
and very weak; but it was provided with the most efficient weapons for
fighting and beating them, for it had exactly the moral forces which
they lacked. Christianity, instead of being, like Druidism, a religion
exclusively national and hostile to all that was foreign, proclaimed a
universal religion, free from all local and national partiality,
addressing itself to all men in the name of the same God, and offering
to all the same salvation. It is one of the strangest and most
significant facts in history, that the religion most universally human,
most dissociated from every consideration but that of the rights and
well-being of the human race in its entirety–that such a religion, be it
repeated, should have come forth from the womb of the most exclusive,
most rigorously and obstinately national religion that ever appeared in
the world, that is, Judaism. Such, nevertheless, was the birth of
Christianity; and this wonderful contrast between the essence and the
earthly origin of Christianity was without doubt one of its most
powerful attractions and most efficacious means of success.

Against Paganism Christianity was armed with moral forces not a whit
less great. Confronting mythological traditions and poetical or
philosophical allegories, appeared a religion truly religious, concerned
solely with the relations of mankind to God and with their eternal
future. To the pagan indifference of the Roman world the Christians
opposed the profound conviction of their faith, and not only their
firmness in defending it against all powers and all dangers, but also
their ardent passion for propagating it without any motive but the
yearning to make their fellows share in its benefits and its hopes. They
confronted, nay, they welcomed martyrdom, at one time to maintain their
own Christianity, at another to make others Christians around them;
propagandizing was for them a duty almost as imperative as fidelity. And
it was not in memory of old and obsolete mythologies, but in the name of
recent deeds and persons, in obedience to laws proceeding from God, One
and Universal, in fulfillment and continuation of a contemporary and
superhuman history,–that of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and Son of
Man,–that the Christians of the first two centuries labored to convert
to their faith the whole Roman world. Marcus Aurelius was contemptuously
astonished at what he called the obstinacy of the Christians; he knew
not from what source these nameless heroes drew a strength superior to
his own, though he was at the same time emperor and sage. It is
impossible to assign with exactness the date of the first footprints and
first labors of Christianity in Gaul. It was not, however, from Italy,
nor in the Latin tongue and through Latin writers, but from the East and
through the Greeks, that it first came and began to spread.
Marseilles–and the different Greek colonies, originally from Asia Minor
and settled upon the shores of the Mediterranean or along the Rhone,
mark the route and were the places whither the first Christian
missionaries carried their teaching: on this point the letters of the
Apostles and the writings of the first two generations of their
disciples are clear and abiding proof. In the west of the empire,
especially in Italy, the Christians at their first appearance were
confounded with the Jews, and comprehended under the same name: “The
Emperor Claudius,” says Suetonius, “drove from Rome (A.D. 52) the Jews
who, at the instigation of Christus, were in continual commotion.” After
the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus (A.D. 71), the Jews, Christian or
not, dispersed throughout the Empire; but the Christians were not slow
to signalize themselves by their religious fervor, and to come forward
everywhere under their own true name. Lyons became the chief centre of
Christian preaching and association in Gaul. As early as the first half
of the second century there existed there a Christian congregation,
regularly organized as a church, and already sufficiently important to
be in intimate and frequent communication with the Christian Churches of
the East and West. There is a tradition, generally admitted, that St.
Pothinus, the first Bishop of Lyons, was sent thither from the East by
the Bishop of Smyrna, St. Polycarp, himself a disciple of St. John. One
thing is certain, that the Christian Church of Lyons produced Gaul’s
first martyrs, amongst whom was the Bishop, St. Pothinus.

It was under Marcus Aurelius, the most philosophical and most
conscientious of the emperors, that there was enacted for the first time
in Gaul, against nascent Christianity, that scene of tyranny and
barbarity which was to be renewed so often and during so many centuries
in the midst of Christendom itself. In the eastern provinces of the
Empire and in Italy the Christians had already been several times
persecuted, now with cold-blooded cruelty, now with some slight
hesitation and irresolution. Nero had caused them to be burned in the
streets of Rome, accusing them of the conflagration himself had kindled,
and, a few months before his fall, St. Peter and St. Paul had undergone
martyrdom at Rome. Domitian had persecuted and put to death Christians
even in his own family, and though invested with the honors of the
consulate. Righteous Trajan, when consulted by Pliny the Younger on the
conduct he should adopt in Bithynia towards the Christians, had
answered, “It is impossible, in this sort of matter, to establish any
certain general rule; there must be no quest set on foot against them,
and no unsigned indictment must be accepted; but if they be accused and
convicted, they must be punished.” To be punished, it sufficed that they
were convicted of being Christians; and it was Trajan himself who
condemned St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, to be brought to Rome and
thrown to the beasts, for the simple reason that he was highly
Christian. Marcus Aurelius, not only by virtue of his philosophical
conscientiousness, but by reason of an incident in his history, seemed
bound to be farther than any other from persecuting the Christians.
During one of his campaigns on the Danube, A.D. 174, his army was
suffering cruelly from fatigue and thirst; and at the very moment when
they were on the point of engaging in a great battle against the
barbarians, the rain fell in abundance, refreshed the Roman soldiers,
and conduced to their victory. There was in the Roman army a legion, the
twelfth, called the \_Melitine\_ or the \_Thundering,\_ which bore on
its roll many Christian soldiers. They gave thanks for the rain and the
victory to the one omnipotent God who had heard their prayers, whilst
the pagans rendered like honor to Jupiter, the rain-giver and the
thunderer. The report about these Christians got spread abroad and
gained credit in the Empire, so much so that there was attributed to
Marcus Aurelius a letter, in which, by reason, no doubt, of this
incident, he forbade persecution of the Christians. Tertullian, a
contemporary witness, speaks of this letter in perfect confidence; and
the Christian writers of the following century did not hesitate to
regard it as authentic. Nowadays a strict examination of its existing
text does not allow such a character to be attributed to it. At any rate
the persecutions of the Christians were not forbidden, for in the year
177, that is, only three years after the victory of Marcus Aurelius over
the Germans, there took place, undoubtedly by his orders, the
persecution which caused at Lyons the first Gallic martyrdom. This was
the fourth, or, according to others, the fifth great imperial
persecution of the Christians.

Most tales of the martyrs were written long after the event, and came to
be nothing more than legends laden with details often utterly puerile or
devoid of proof. The martyrs of Lyons in the second century wrote, so to
speak, their own history; for it was their comrades, eye-witnesses of
their sufferings and their virtue, who gave an account of them in a long
letter addressed to their friends in Asia Minor, and written with
passionate sympathy and pious prolixity, but bearing all the,
characteristics of truth. It seems desirable to submit for perusal that
document, which has been preserved almost entire in the Ecclesiastical
History of Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea in the third century, and which
will exhibit, better than any modern representations, the state of facts
and of souls in the midst of the imperial persecutions, and the mighty
faith, devotion, and courage with which the early Christians faced the
most cruel trials.

"The servants of Christ, dwelling at Vienne and Lyons in Gaul, to the
brethren settled in Asia and Phrygia, who have the same faith and hope
of redemption that we have, peace, grace, and glory from God the Father
and Jesus Christ our Lord!

"None can tell to you in speech or fully set forth to you in writing the
weight of our misery, the madness and rage of the Gentiles against the
saints, and all that hath been suffered by the blessed martyrs. Our
enemy doth rush upon us with all the fury of his powers, and already
gives us a foretaste and the first-fruits of all the license with which
he doth intend to set upon us. He hath omitted nothing for the training
of his agents against us, and he doth exercise them in a sort of
preparatory work against the servants of the Lord. Not only are we
driven from the public buildings, from the baths, and from the forum,
but it is forbidden to all our people to appear publicly in any place
whatsoever.

"The grace of God hath striven for us against the devil: at the same
time that it hath sustained the weak, it hath opposed to the Evil One,
as it were, pillars of strength–men strong and valiant, ready to draw on
themselves all his attacks. They have had to bear all manner of insult;
they have deemed but a small matter that which others find hard and
terrible; and they have thought only of going to Christ, proving by
their example that the sufferings of this world are not worthy to be put
in the balance with the glory which is to be manifested in us. They have
endured, in the first place, all the outrages that could be heaped upon
them by the multitude, outcries, blows, thefts, spoliation, stoning,
imprisonment, all that the fury of the people could devise against hated
enemies. Then, dragged to the forum by the military tribune and the
magistrates of the city, they have been questioned before the people and
cast into prison until the coming of the governor. He, from the moment
our people appeared before him, committed all manner of violence against
them. Then stood forth one of our brethren, Vettius Epagathus, full of
love towards God and his neighbor, living a life so pure and strict
that, young as he was, men held him to be the equal of the aged
Zacharias.– He could not bear that judgment so unjust should go forth
against us, and, moved with indignation, he asked leave to defend his
brethren, and to prove that there was in them no kind of irreligion or
impiety. Those present at the tribunal, amongst whom he was known and
celebrated, cried out against him, and the governor himself, enraged at
so just a demand, asked him no more than this question, ‘Art thou a
Christian?’ Straightway with a loud voice, he declared himself a
Christian, and was placed amongst the number of the martyrs. . . .

"Afterwards the rest began to be examined and classed. The first, firm
and well prepared, made hearty and solemn confession of their faith.
Others, ill prepared and with little firmness, showed that they lacked
strength for such a fight. About ten of them fell away, which caused us
incredible pain and mourning. Their example broke down the courage of
others, who, not being yet in bonds, though they had already had much to
suffer, kept close to the martyrs, and withdrew not out of their sight.
Then were we all stricken with dread for the issue of the trial: not
that we had great fear of the torments inflicted, but because,
prophesying the result according to the degree of courage of the
accused, we feared much falling away. They took, day by day, those of
our brethren who were worthy to replace the weak; so that all the best
of the two churches, those whose care and zeal had founded them, were
taken and confined. They took, likewise, some of our slaves, for the
governor had ordered that they should be all summoned to attend in
public; and they, fearing the torments they saw the saints undergo, and
instigated by the soldiers, accused us falsely of odious deeds, such as
the banquet of Thyestes, the incest of Oedipus, and other crimes which
must not be named or even thought of, and which we cannot bring
ourselves to believe that men were ever guilty of. These reports having
once spread amongst the people, even those persons who had hitherto, by
reason, perhaps, of relationship, shown moderation towards us, burst
forth into bitter indignation against our people. Thus was fulfilled
that which had been prophesied by the Lord: ‘The time cometh when
whosoever shall kill you shall think that he doeth God service.’ Since
that day the holy martyrs have suffered tortures that no words can
express.

"The fury of the multitude, of the governor, and of the soldiers, fell
chiefly upon Sanctus, a deacon of Vienne; upon Maturus, a neophyte
still, but already a valiant champion of Christ; upon Attalus also, born
at Pergamus, but who hath ever been one of the pillars of our Church;
upon Blandina, lastly, in whom Christ hath made it appear that persons
who seem vile and despised of men are just those whom God holds in the
highest honor by reason of the excellent love they bear Him, which is
manifested in their firm virtue, and not in vain show. All of us, and
even Blandina’s mistress here below, who fought valiantly with the other
martyrs, feared that this poor slave, so weak of body, would not be in a
condition to freely confess her faith; but she was sustained by such
vigor of soul that the executioners, who from morn till eve put her to
all manner of torture, failed in their efforts, and declared themselves
beaten, not knowing what further punishment to inflict, and marveling
that she still lived, with her body pierced through and through, and
torn piecemeal by so many tortures, of which a single one should have
sufficed to kill her. But that blessed saint, like a valiant athlete,
took fresh courage and strength from the confession of her faith; all
feeling of pain vanished, and ease returned to her at the mere utterance
of the words, ‘I am a Christian, and no evil is wrought amongst us.’

"As for Sanctus, the executioners hoped that in the midst of the
tortures inflicted upon him–the most atrocious which man could
devise–they would hear him say something unseemly or unlawful; but so
firmly did he resist them, that, without even saying his name, or that
of his nation or city, or whether he was bond or free, he only replied
in the Roman tongue, to all questions, ‘I am a Christian.’ Therein was,
for him, his name, his country, his condition, his whole being; and
never could the Gentiles wrest from him another word. The fury of the
governor and the executioners was redoubled against him; and, not
knowing how to torment him further, they applied to his most tender
members bars of red-hot iron. His members burned; but he, upright and
immovable, persisted in his profession of faith, as if living waters
from the bosom of Christ flowed over him and refreshed him. . . . Some
days after, these infidels began again to torture him, believing that if
they inflicted upon his blistering wounds the same agonies, they would
triumph over him, who seemed unable to bear the mere touch of their
hands; and they hoped, also, that the sight of this torturing alive
would terrify his comrades. But, contrary to general expectation, the
body of Sanctus, rising suddenly up, stood erect and firm amidst these
repeated torments, and recovered its old appearance and the use of its
members, as if, by Divine grace, this second laceration of his flesh had
caused healing rather than suffering. . . .

"When the tyrants had thus expended and exhausted their tortures against
the firmness of the martyrs sustained by Christ, the devil devised other
contrivances. They were cast into the darkest and most unendurable place
in their prison; their feet were dragged out and compressed to the
utmost tension of the muscles; the jailers, as if instigated by a demon,
tried every sort of torture, insomuch that several of them, for whom God
willed such an end, died of suffocation in prison. Others, who had been
tortured in such a manner that it was thought impossible they should
long survive, deprived as they were of every remedy and aid from men,
but supported nevertheless by the grace of God, remained sound and
strong in body as in soul, and comforted and reanimated their brethren.
. . .

"The blessed Pothinus, who held at that time the bishopric of Lyons,
being upwards of ninety, and so weak in body that he could hardly
breathe, was himself brought before the tribunal, so worn with old age
and sickness that he seemed nigh to extinction; but he still possessed
his soul, wherewith to serve the triumph of Christ. Being brought by the
soldiers before the tribunal, whither he was accompanied by all the
magistrates of the city and the whole populace, that pursued him with
hootings, he offered, as if he had been the very Christ, the most
glorious testimony. At a question from the governor, who asked what the
God of the Christians was, he answered, ‘If thou be worthy, thou shalt
know.’ He was immediately raised up, without any respect or humanity,
and blows were showered upon him; those who happened to be nearest to
him assaulted him grievously with foot and fist, without the slightest
regard for his age; those who were farther off cast at him whatever was
to their hand; they would all have thought themselves guilty of the
greatest default if they had not done their best, each on his own score,
to insult him brutally. They believed they were avenging the wrongs of
their gods. Pothinus, still breathing, was cast again into prison, and
two days after yielded up his spirit.

"Then were manifested a singular dispensation of God and the
immeasurable compassion of Jesus Christ; an example rare amongst
brethren, but in accord with the intentions and the justice of the Lord.
All those who, at their first arrest, had denied their faith, were
themselves cast into prison and given over to the same sufferings as the
other martyrs, for their denial did not serve them at all. Those who had
made profession of being what they really were–that is, Christians–were
imprisoned without being accused of other crimes. The former, on the
contrary, were confined as homicides and wretches, thus suffering a
double punishment. The one sort found repose in the honorable joys of
martyrdom, in the hope of promised blessedness, in the love of Christ,
and in the spirit of God the Father; the other were a prey to the
reproaches of conscience. It was easy to distinguish the one from the
other by their looks. The one walked joyously, bearing on their faces a
majesty mingled with sweetness, and their very bonds seemed unto them an
ornament, even as the broidery that decks a bride . . . the other, with
downcast eyes and humble and dejected air, were an object of contempt to
the Gentiles themselves, who regarded them as cowards who had forfeited
the glorious and saving name of Christians. And so they who were present
at this double spectacle were thereby signally strengthened, and whoever
amongst them chanced to be arrested confessed the faith without doubt or
hesitation. . . .

"Things having come to this pass, different kinds of death were
inflicted on the martyrs, and they offered to God a crown of divers
flowers. It was but right that the most valiant champions, those who had
sustained a double assault and gained a signal victory, should receive a
splendid crown of immortality. The neophyte Maturus and the deacon
Sanctus, with Blandina and Attalus, then, were led into the
amphitheatre, and thrown to the beasts, as a sight to please the
inhumanity of the Gentiles. . . . Maturus and Sanctus there underwent
all kinds of tortures, as if they had hitherto suffered nothing; or,
rather, like athletes who had already been several times victorious, and
were contending for the crown of crowns, they braved the stripes with
which they were beaten, the bites of the beasts that dragged them to and
fro, and all that was demanded by the outcries of an insensate mob, so
much the more furious, because it could by no means overcome the
firmness of the martyrs or extort from Sanctus any other speech than
that which, on the first day, he had uttered: ‘I am a Christian.’

"After this fearful contest, as life was not extinct, their throats were
at last cut, when they alone had thus been offered as a spectacle to the
public instead of the variety displayed in the combat of gladiators.
Blandina, in her turn, tied to a stake, was given to the beasts: she was
seen hanging, as it were, on a sort of cross, calling upon God with
trustful fervor, and the brethren present were reminded, in the person
of a sister, of Him who had been crucified for their salvation. . . . As
none of the beasts would touch the body of Blandina, she was released
from the stake, taken back to prison, and reserved for another occasion.
. . . Attalus, whose execution, seeing that he was a man of mark, was
furiously demanded by the people, came forward ready to brave
everything, as a man deriving confidence from the memory of his life,
for he had courageously trained himself to discipline, and had always
amongst us borne witness for the truth. He was led all round the
amphitheatre, preceded by a board bearing this inscription in Latin:
‘This is Attalus the Christian.’ The people pursued him with the most
furious hootings; but the governor, having learnt that he was a Roman
citizen, had him taken back to prison with the rest. Having subsequently
written to Caesar, he waited for his decision as to those who were thus
detained.

"This delay was neither useless nor unprofitable, for then shone forth
the boundless compassion of Christ. Those of the brethren who had been
but dead members of the Church, were recalled to life by the pains and
help of the living; the martyrs obtained grace for those who had fallen
away; and great was the joy in the Church, at the same time virgin and
mother, for she once more found living those whom she had given up for
dead. Thus revived and strengthened by the goodness of God, who willeth
not the death of the sinner, but rather inviteth him to repentance, they
presented themselves before the tribunal, to be questioned afresh by the
governor. Caesar had replied that they who confessed themselves to be
Christians should be put to the sword, and they who denied sent away
safe and sound. When the time for the great market had fully come, there
assembled a numerous multitude from every nation and every province. The
governor had the blessed martyrs brought up before his judgment-seat,
showing them before the people with all the pomp of a theatre. He
questioned them afresh; and those who were discovered to be Roman
citizens were beheaded, the rest were thrown to the beasts.

"Great glory was gained for Christ by means of those who had at first
denied their faith, and who now confessed it contrary to the expectation
of the Gentiles. Those who, having been privately questioned, declared
themselves Christians were added to the number of the martyrs. Those in
whom appeared no vestige of faith, and no fear of God, remained without
the pale of the Church. When they were dealing with those who had been
reunited to it, one Alexander, a Phrygian by nation, a physician by
profession, who had for many years been dwelling in Gaul, a man well
known to all for his love of God and open preaching of the faith, took
his place in the hall of judgment, exhorting by signs all who filled it
to confess their faith, even as if he had been called in to deliver them
of it. The multitude, enraged to see that those who had at first denied,
turned round and proclaimed their faith, cried out against Alexander,
whom they accused of the conversion. The governor forthwith asked him
what he was, and at the answer, ‘I am a Christian,’ condemned him to the
beasts. On the morrow Alexander was again brought up, together with
Attalus, whom the governor, to please the people, had once more
condemned to the beasts. After they had both suffered in the
amphitheatre all the torments that could be devised, they were put to
the sword. Alexander uttered not a complaint, not a word; he had the air
of one who was talking inwardly with God. Attalus, seated on an iron
seat, and waiting for the fire to consume his body, said, in Latin, to
the people, ‘See what ye are doing; it is in truth devouring men; as for
us, we devour not men, and we do no evil at all.’ He was asked what was
the name of God: ‘God,’ said he, ‘is not like us mortals; He hath no
name.’

"After all these martyrs, on the last day of the shows, Blandina was
again brought up, together with a young lad, named Ponticus, about
fifteen years old. They had been brought up every day before that they
might see the tortures of their brethren. When they were called upon to
swear by the altars of the Gentiles, they remained firm in their faith,
making no account of those pretended gods, and so great was the fury of
the multitude against them, that no pity was shown for the age of the
child or the sex of the woman. Tortures were heaped upon them; they were
made to pass through every kind of torment, but the desired end was not
gained. Supported by the exhortations of his sister, who was seen and
heard by the Gentiles, Ponticus, after having endured all magnanimously,
gave up the ghost. Blandina, last of all,–like a noble mother that hath
roused the courage of her sons for the fight, and sent them forth to
conquer for their king,–passed once more through all the tortures they
had suffered, anxious to go and rejoin them, and rejoicing at each step
towards death. At length, after she had undergone fire, the talons of
beasts, and agonizing aspersion, she was wrapped in a network and thrown
to a bull that tossed her in the air; she was already unconscious of all
that befell her, and seemed altogether taken up with watching for the
blessings that Christ had in store for her. Even the Gentiles allowed
that never a woman had suffered so much or so long.

“Still their fury and their cruelty towards the saints were not
appeased. They devised another way of raging against them; they cast to
the dogs the bodies of those who had died of suffocation in prison, and
watched night and day that none of our brethren might come and bury
them. As for what remained of the martyrs’ half-mangled or devoured
corpses, they left them exposed under a guard of soldiers, coming to
look on them with insulting eyes, and saying, ‘Where is now their God?
Of what use to them was this religion for which they laid down their
lives?’ We were overcome with grief that we were not able to bury these
poor corpses; nor the darkness of night, nor gold, nor prayers could
help us to succeed therein. After being thus exposed for six days in the
open air, given over to all manner of outrage, the corpses of the
martyrs were at last burned, reduced to ashes, and cast hither and
thither by the infidels upon the waters of the Rhone, that there might
be left no trace of them on earth. They acted as if they had been more
mighty than God, and could rob our brethren of their resurrection: ‘It’s
in that hope,’ said they, ‘that these folk bring amongst us a new and
strange religion, that they set at nought the most painful torments, and
that they go joyfully to face death: let us see if they will rise again,
if their God will come to their aid and will be able to tear them from
our hands.’”

It is not without a painful effort that, even after so many centuries,
we can resign ourselves to be witnesses, in imagination only, of such a
spectacle. We can scarce believe that amongst men of the same period and
the same city so much ferocity could be displayed in opposition to so
much courage, the passion for barbarity against the passion for virtue.
Nevertheless, such is history; and it should be represented as it really
was: first of all, for truth’s sake; then for the due appreciation of
virtue and all it costs of effort and sacrifice; and, lastly, for the
purpose of showing what obstacles have to be surmounted, what struggles
endured, and what sufferings borne, when the question is the
accomplishment of great moral and social reforms. Marcus Aurelius was,
without any doubt, a virtuous ruler, and one who had it in his heart to
be just and humane; but he was an absolute ruler, that is to say, one
fed entirely on his owns ideas, very ill-informed about the facts on
which he had to decide, and without a free public to warn him of the
errors of his ideas or the practical results of his decrees. He ordered
the persecution of the Christians without knowing what the Christians
were, or what the persecution would be, and this conscientious
philosopher let loose at Lyons, against the most conscientious of
subjects, the zealous servility of his agents, and the atrocious
passions of the mob.

The persecution of the Christians did not stop at Lyons, or with Marcus
Aurelius; it became, during the third century, the common practice of
the emperors in all parts of the Empire: from A.D. 202 to 312, under the
reigns of Septimius Severus, Maximinus the First, Decius, Valerian,
Aurelian, Diocletian, Maximian, and Galerius, there are reckoned six
great general persecutions, without counting others more circumscribed
or less severe. The Emperors Alexander Severns, Philip the Arabian, and
Constantius Chlorus were almost the only exceptions to this cruel
system; and nearly always, wherever it was in force, the Pagan mob, in
its brutality or fanatical superstition, added to imperial rigor its own
atrocious and cynical excesses.

But Christian zeal was superior in perseverance and efficacy to Pagan
persecution. St. Pothinus the Martyr was succeeded as bishop at Lyons by
St. Irenaeus, the most learned, most judicious, and most illustrious of
the early heads of the Church in Gaul. Originally from Asia Minor,
probably from Smyrna, he had migrated to Gaul, at what particular date
is not known, and had settled as a simple priest in the diocese of
Lyons, where it was not long before he exercised vast influence, as well
on the spot as also during certain missions intrusted to him, and
amongst them one, they say, to the Pope St. Eleutherius at Rome. Whilst
Bishop of Lyons, from A.D. 177 to 202, he employed the five and twenty
years in propagating the Christian faith in Gaul, and in defending, by
his writings, the Christian doctrines against the discord to which they
had already been subjected in the East, and which was beginning to
penetrate to the West. In 202, during the persecution instituted by
Septimius Severus, St. Irenaeus crowned by martyrdom his active and
influential life. It was in his episcopate that there began what may be
called the swarm of Christian missionaries who, towards the end of the
second and during the third centuries, spread over the whole of Gaul,
preaching the faith and forming churches. Some went from Lyons at the
instigation of St. Irenaeus; others from Rome, especially under the
pontificate of Pope St. Fabian, himself martyred in 219; St. Felix and
St. Fortunatus to Valence, St. Ferreol to Besancon, St. Marcellus to
Chalons-sur-Saone, St. Benignus to Dijon, St. Trophimus to Arles, St.
Paul to Narbonne, St. Saturninus to Toulouse, St. Martial to Limoges,
St. Andeol and St. Privatus to the Cevennes, St. Austremoine to
Clermont-Ferrand, St. Gatian to Tours, St. Denis to Paris, and so many
others that their names are scarcely known beyond the pages of erudite
historians, or the very spots where they preached, struggled, and
conquered, often at the price of their lives. Such were the founders of
the faith and of the Christian Church in France. At the commencement of
the fourth century their work was, if not accomplished, at any rate
triumphant; and when, A.D. 312, Constantine declared himself a
Christian, he confirmed the fact of the conquest of the Roman world, and
of Gaul in particular, by Christianity. No doubt the majority of the
inhabitants were not as yet Christians; but it was clear that the
Christians were in the ascendant and had command of the future. Of the
two grand elements which were to meet together, on the ruins of Roman
society, for the formation of modern society, the moral element, the
Christian religion, had already taken possession of souls; the
devastated territory awaited the coming of new peoples, known to history
under the general name of Germans, whom the Romans called the
barbarians.
