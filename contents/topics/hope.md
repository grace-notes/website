**Hope** is the mental attitude of confidence that results from learning and applying Bible truth regarding the future.

In Bible usage, “hope” (Greek: ελπις) is synonymous with “confidence” or “expectation of a good outcome.” Growth in confidence comes along with growth in Christ. Applied knowledge of Bible principles of time and eternity leads to supreme confidence in God’s word.

The Christian has confidence in

* an eternal inheritance, **1 Pet. 1:4,5**

* the new home in the future, **John 14:1-3**

* the resurrection body, **1 Cor. 15:51-57**

See also **1 Th. 4:16-18; (verse context does not seem to fit.) and 1 John 3:1,2.**

The **hope** of Israel is in their coming Messiah (the second coming of Christ, His kingdom on earth, and the new earth of eternity.

**Luke 1:67-79; 2:28-32; Acts 26:6,7; 28:20; Eph. 2:12.**

The Abrahamic Covenant (amplified by the Palestinian, Davidic, and New Covenants) promised to Israel the land of Canaan, the eternal seed (the Messiah), and blessing (new birth). Israel’s **hope** lies in these promises of God.

Abraham’s **hope** was directed to the promise of a new city, the new Jerusalem, **Heb. 11:9,10.**

The **hope** for the church is the blessed hope of the rapture. **Titus 2:13-15; 1 John 3:2,3; 1 Thess. 4:13-18**

**Hope** is derived from such passages as (this verse does not fit this context). which it is stated that there will be no more death, tears, pain, etc.

The **hope** or confidence we have in Christ has caused death to lose its sting and the grave to lose its victory. **1 Cor. 15:54-58.**

The word **hopeless** should never be in the Christian’s vocabulary
