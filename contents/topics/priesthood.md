The Priesthood

Among the most interesting glimpses of early life in the church is that
afforded by a small piece of rapidly-drawn scenery which presents to our
view ‘a great company of the priests,’ ‘obedient to the faith’ (Acts
6:7). We seem to be carried back in imagination to the time when Levi
remained faithful amidst the general spiritual defection (Exodus 32:26),
and then through the long vista of devout ministering priests to reach
the fulfilment of this saying of Malachi–part admonition, and part
prophecy: ‘For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should
seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts’
(Malachi 2:7). We can picture to ourselves how they who ministered in
holy things would at eventide, when the Temple was deserted of its
worshippers, gather to speak of the spiritual meaning of the services,
and to consider the wonderful things which had taken place in Jerusalem,
as some alleged, in fulfilment of those very types that formed the
essence of their office and ministry. ‘For this thing was not done in a
corner.’ The trial of Jesus, His condemnation by the Sanhedrim, and His
being delivered up to the Gentiles, must have formed the theme of
frequent and anxious discussion in the Temple. Were not their own chief
priests implicated in the matter? Did not Judas on that fatal day rush
into the Temple, and wildly cast the ‘price of blood’ into the
‘treasury’? On the other hand, was not one of the principal priests and
a member of the priestly council, Joseph of Arimathea, an adherent of
Christ? Did not the Sanhedrist Nicodemus adopt the same views, and even
Gamaliel advise caution? Besides, in the ‘porches’ of the Temple,
especially in that of Solomon, ‘a notable miracle’ had been done in
‘that Name,’ and there also its all-prevailing power was daily
proclaimed. It specially behoved the priesthood to inquire well into the
matter; and the Temple seemed the most appropriate place for its
discussion.

The Number of Priests

The number of priests to be found at all times in Jerusalem must have
been very great, and Ophel a densely inhabited quarter. According to
Jewish tradition, half of each of the twenty-four ‘courses,’ into which
the priesthood were divided, were permanently resident in Jerusalem; the
rest scattered over the land. It is added, that about one half of the
latter had settled in Jericho, and were in the habit of supplying the
needful support to their brethren while officiating in Jerusalem. Of
course such statements must not be taken literally, though no doubt they
are substantially correct. When a ‘course’ was on duty, all its members
were bound to appear in the Temple. Those who stayed away, with such
‘representatives of the people’ (or ‘stationary men’) as, like them, had
been prevented from ‘going up’ to Jerusalem in their turn, had to meet
in the synagogues of their district to pray and to fast each day of
their week of service, except on the sixth, the seventh, and the
first–that is, neither on the Sabbath, nor on the days preceding and
succeeding it, as the ‘joy’ attaching to the Sabbath rendered a fast
immediately before or after it inappropriate.

Symbolism of the Priesthood / Mediation

It need scarcely be said, that everything connected with the priesthood
was intended to be symbolical and typical–the office itself, its
functions, even its dress and outward support. The fundamental design of
Israel itself was to be unto Jehovah ‘a kingdom of priests and an holy
nation’ (Exo 19:5,6). This, however, could only be realised in ‘the
fulness of time.’ At the very outset there was the barrier of sin; and
in order to gain admittance to the ranks of Israel, when ‘the sum of the
children of Israel was taken after their number,’ every man had to give
the half-shekel, which in after times became the regular Temple
contribution, as ‘a ransom (covering) for his soul unto Jehovah’ (Exodus
30:12,13). But even so Israel was sinful, and could only approach
Jehovah in the way which Himself opened, and in the manner which He
appointed. Direct choice and appointment by God were the conditions
alike of the priesthood, of sacrifices, feasts, and of every detail of
service. The fundamental ideas which underlay all and connected it into
a harmonious whole, were reconciliation and mediation: the one expressed
by typically atoning sacrifices, the other by a typically intervening
priesthood. Even the Hebrew term for priest (Cohen) denotes in its
root-meaning ‘one who stands up for another, and mediates in his cause.’
\*

\* This root-meaning (through the Arabic) of the Hebrew word for priest,
as one intervening, explains its occasional though very rare application
to others than priests, as, for example, to the sons of David (2 Samuel
8:18), a mode of expression which is thus correctly paraphrased in 1
Chronicles 18:17: ‘And the sons of David were at the hand of the king.’

For this purpose God chose the tribe of Levi, and out of it again the
family of Aaron, on whom He bestowed the ‘priest’s office as a gift’
(Numbers 18:7). But the whole characteristics and the functions of the
priesthood centred in the person of the high-priest. In accordance with
their Divine ‘calling’ (Hebrews 5:4) was the special and exceptional
provision made for the support of the priesthood. Its principle was thus
expressed: ‘I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of
Israel’; and its joyousness, when realised in its full meaning and
application, found vent in such words as Psalm 16:5, 6: ‘Jehovah is the
portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: Thou maintainest my lot. The
lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
heritage.’

Holiness

But there was yet another idea to be expressed by the priesthood. The
object of reconciliation was holiness. Israel was to be ‘a holy
nation’–reconciled through the ‘sprinkling of blood’; brought near to,
and kept in fellowship with God by that means. The priesthood, as the
representative offerers of that blood and mediators of the people, were
also to show forth the ‘holiness’ of Israel. Every one knows how this
was symbolised by the gold-plate which the high-priest wore on his
forehead, and which bore the words: ‘Holiness unto Jehovah.’ But though
the high-priest in this, as in every other respect, was the fullest
embodiment of the functions and object of the priesthood, the same truth
was also otherwise shown forth. The bodily qualifications required in
the priesthood, the kind of defilements which would temporarily or
wholly interrupt their functions, their mode of ordination, and even
every portion, material, and colour of their distinctive dress were all
intended to express in a symbolical manner this characteristic of
holiness. In all these respects there was a difference between Israel
and the tribe of Levi; between the tribe of Levi and the family of
Aaron; and, finally, between an ordinary priest and the high-priest, who
most fully typified our Great High-priest, in whom all these symbols
have found their reality.

The Twenty-four Courses

This much it seemed necessary to state for the general understanding of
the matter. Full details belong to the exposition of the meaning and
object of the Levitical priesthood, as instituted by God, while our
present task rather is to trace its further development to what it was
at the time when Jesus was in the Temple. The first peculiarity of
post-Mosaic times which we here meet, is the arrangement of the
priesthood into ‘twenty-four courses,’ which undoubtedly dates from the
times of David. But Jewish tradition would make it even much older. For,
according to the Talmud, it should be traced up to Moses, who is
variously supposed to have arranged the sons of Aaron into either or
else sixteen courses (four, or else eight, of Eleazar; and the other
four, or else eight, of Ithamar), to which, on the one supposition,
Samuel and David each added other eight ‘courses,’ or, on the other,
Samuel and David, in conjunction, the eight needed to make up the
twenty-four mentioned in 1 Chronicles 24. It need scarcely be told that,
like many similar statements, this also is simply an attempt to trace up
every arrangement to the fountain-head of Jewish history, in order to
establish its absolute authority.\*

\* Curiously enough, here also the analogy between Rabbinism and Roman
Catholicism holds good. Each claims for its teaching and practices the
so-called principle of catholicity–‘semper, ubique, ab omnibus’
(’always, everywhere, by all’), and each invents the most curious
historical fables in support of it!

The Courses After the Captivity

The institution of David and of Solomon continued till the Babylonish
captivity. Thence, however, only four out of the twenty-four ‘courses’
returned: those of Jedaiah, Immer, Pashur, and Harim (Ezra 2:36-39), the
course of ‘Jedaiah’ being placed first because it was of the
high-priest’s family, ‘of the house of Jeshua,’ ‘the son of Jozadak’
(Ezra 3:2; Haggai 1:1; 1 Chron 6:15). To restore the original number,
each of these four families was directed to draw five lots for those
which had not returned, so as to form once more twenty-four courses,
which were to bear the ancient names. Thus, for example, Zacharias, the
father of John the Baptist, did not really belong to the family of
Abijah (1 Chronicles 24:10), which had not returned from Babylon, but to
the ‘course of Abia,’ which had been formed out of some other family,
and only bore the ancient name (Luke 1:5). Like the priests, the Levites
had at the time of King David been arranged into twenty-four ‘courses,’
which were to act as ‘priests’ assistance’ (1 Chronicles 23:4,28), as
‘singers and musicians’ (1 Chronicles 25:6), as ‘gate-keepers and
guards’ (1 Chronicles 26:6 and following), and as ‘officers and judges.’
Of these various classes, that of the ‘priests’ assistants’ was by far
the most numerous, \* and to them the charge of the Temple had been
committed in subordination to the priests.

\* Apparently it numbered 24,000, out of a total of 38,000 Levites.

It had been their duty to look after the sacred vestments and vessels;
the store-houses and their contents; and the preparation of the
shewbread, of the meat-offerings, of the spices, etc. They were also
generally to assist the priests in their work, to see to the cleaning of
the sanctuary, and to take charge of the treasuries (1 Chronicles
23:28-32).

In the Temple of Herod

Of course these services, as also those of the singers and musicians,
and of the porters and guards, were retained in the Temple of Herod. But
for the employment of Levites as ‘officers and judges’ there was no
further room, not only because such judicial functions as still remained
to the Jews were in the hands of the Sanhedrim and its subordinate
authorities, but also because in general the ranks of the Levites were
so thinned. In point of fact, while no less than 4,289 priests had
returned from Babylon, the number of Levites was under 400 (Ezra
2:40-42; Nehemiah 7:43-45), of whom only 74 were ‘priests’
assistants.‘To this the next immigration, under Ezra, added only 38, and
that though the Levites had been specially searched for (Ezra
8:15,18,19). According to tradition, Ezra punished them by depriving
them of their tithes. The gap in their number was filled up by 220
Nethinim (Ezra 8:20), literally, ’given ones,’ probably originally
strangers and captives, \* as in all likelihood the Gibeonites had been
the first ‘Nethinim’ (Joshua 9:21,23,27).

\* This is also confirmed by their foreign names (Ezra 2:43-58). The
total number of Nethinim who returned from Babylon was 612–392 with
Zerubbabel (Ezra 2:58; Nehemiah 7:60), and 220 with Ezra (Ezra 8:20).

Though the Nethinim, like the Levites and priests, were freed from all
taxation (Ezra 7:24), and perhaps also from military service (Jos. Anti.
iii. 12; iv. 4, 3.), the Rabbinists held them in the lowest
repute–beneath a bastard, though above a proselyte–forbade their
intermarrying with Israelites, and declared them incapable of proper
membership in the congregation.

Duties of Priests and Levites

The duties of priests and Levites in the Temple may be gathered from
Scripture, and will be further explained in the course of our inquiries.
Generally, it may here be stated that on the Levites devolved the
Temple-police, the guard of the gates, and the duty of keeping
everything about the sanctuary clean and bright. But as at night the
priests kept watch about the innermost places of the Temple, so they
also opened and closed all the inner gates, while the Levites discharged
this duty in reference to the outer gates, which led upon the Temple
Mount (or Court of the Gentiles), and to the ‘Beautiful Gate,’ which
formed the principal entrance into the Court of the Women. The laws of
Levitical cleanness, as explained by the Rabbis, were most rigidly
enforced upon worshippers and priests. If a leper, or any other who was
‘defiled,’ had ventured into the sanctuary itself, or any priest
officiated in a state of ‘uncleanness,’ he would, if discovered, be
dragged out and killed, without form of process, by ‘the rebels’
beating.’ Minor punishments were awarded to those guilty of smaller
offences of the same kind. The Sabbath-rest was strictly enforced, so
far as consistent with the necessary duties of the Temple service. But
the latter superseded the Sabbath law (Matthew 12:5) and defilement on
account of death. If the time for offering a sacrifice was not fixed, so
that it might be brought on one day as well as another, then the service
did not supersede either the Sabbath or defilement on account of death.
But where the time was unalterably fixed, there the higher duty of
obedience to a direct command came in to supersede alike the Sabbath and
this one (but only this one) ground of defilement. The same principle
applied to worshippers as well as priests.

The Week’s Service

Each ‘course’ of priests and of Levites (as has already been stated)
came on duty for a week, from one Sabbath to another. The service of the
week was subdivided among the various families which constituted a
‘course’; so that if it consisted of five ‘houses of fathers,’ three
served each one day, and two each two days; if of six families, five
served each one day, and one two days; if of eight families, six served
each one day, and the other two in conjunction on one day; or, lastly,
if of nine families, five served each one day, and the other four took
it two in conjunction for two days. These divisions and arrangements
were made by ‘the chiefs’ or ‘heads of the houses of their fathers.’ On
Sabbaths the whole ‘course’ was on duty; on feast-days any priest might
come up and join in the ministrations of the sanctuary; and at the Feast
of Tabernacles all the twenty-four courses were bound to be present and
officiate. While actually engaged on service in the Temple, the priests
were not allowed to drink wine, either by day or by night. The other
‘families’ or ‘houses’ also of the ‘course’ who were in attendance at
Jerusalem, though not on actual duty, were, during their week of
ministry, prohibited the use of wine, except at night, because they
might have to be called in to assist their brethren of the officiating
‘family,’ which they could not do if they had partaken of strong drink.
The law even made (a somewhat curious) provision to secure that the
priests should come up to Jerusalem properly trimmed, washed, and
attired, so as to secure the decorum of the service.

These Functions Not Sacerdotal

It would be difficult to conceive arrangements more thoroughly or
consistently opposed to what are commonly called ‘priestly pretensions,’
than those of the Old Testament. The fundamental principle, laid down at
the outset, that all Israel were ‘a kingdom of priests’ (Exodus 19:5,6),
made the priesthood only representatives of the people. Their income,
which even under the most favourable circumstances must have been
moderate, was, as we have seen, dependent on the varying religious state
of the nation, since no law existed by which either the payment of
tithes or any other offerings could be enforced. How little power or
influence, comparatively speaking, the priesthood wielded, is
sufficiently known from Jewish history. Out of actual service neither
the priests nor even the high-priest wore a distinctive dress (comp.
Acts 23:5; see also chapter 7), and though a number of civil
restrictions were laid on priests, there were few corresponding
advantages. It is indeed true that alliances with distinguished priestly
families were eagerly sought, and that during the troubled period of
Syrian domination the high-priest for a time held civil as well as
religious rule. But the latter advantage was dearly bought, both as
regarded the priests and the nation.

Nor must we forget the powerful controlling influence which Rabbinism
exercised. Its tendency, which must never be lost sight of in the study
of the state of Palestine at the time of our Lord, was steadily against
all privileges other than those gained by traditionary learning and
theological ingenuity. The Pharisee, or, rather, the man learned in the
traditional law, was everything both before God and before man; ‘but
this people, who knoweth not the law,’ were ‘cursed,’ plebeians, country
people, unworthy of any regard or attention. Rabbinism applied these
principles even in reference to the priesthood. It divided all priests
into ‘learned’ and ‘unlettered,’ and excluded the latter from some of
the privileges of their own order. Thus there were certain priestly dues
which the people might at will give to any priest they chose. But from
some of them the ‘unlettered’ priests were debarred, on the ostensible
ground that in their ignorance they might have partaken of them in a
state of Levitical uncleanness, and so committed mortal sin.

Training of Priests

In general, the priests had to undergo a course of instruction, and were
examined before being allowed to officiate. Similarly, they were subject
to the ordinary tribunals, composed of men learned in the law, without
regard to their descent from one or another tribe. The ordained ‘rulers’
of the synagogues, the teachers of the people, the leaders of their
devotions, and all other officials were not necessarily ‘priests,’ but
simply chosen for their learning and fitness. Any one whom the ‘elders’
or ‘rulers’ deemed qualified for it might, at their request, address to
the people on the Sabbath a ‘word of exhortation.’ Even the high-priest
himself was answerable to the Sanhedrim. It is distinctly stated, that
‘if he committed an offence which by the law deserved whipping, the
Great Sanhedrim whipt him, and then had him restored again to his
office.’ Every year a kind of ecclesiastical council was appointed to
instruct him in his duties for the Day of Atonement, ‘in case he were
not learned,’ or, at any rate, to see to it that he knew and remembered
them. Nay, the principle was broadly laid down–that ‘a scholar, though
he were a bastard, was of far higher value than an unlearned
high-priest.’ If, besides all this, it is remembered how the political
influence of the high-priest had decayed in the days of Herod, and how
frequently the occupants of that office changed, through the caprice of
the rulers or through bribery, the state of public feeling will be
readily understood.

At the same time, it must be admitted, that generally speaking the
high-priest would, of necessity, wield very considerable influence, and
that, ordinarily, those who held the sacred office were not only
‘lettered,’ but members of the Sanhedrim. According to Jewish tradition,
the high-priest ought, in every respect, to excel all other priests, and
if he were poor, the rest were to contribute, so as to secure him an
independent fortune. Certain marks of outward respect were also shown
him. When he entered the Temple he was accompanied by three persons–one
walking at each side, the third behind him. He might, without being
appointed to it, officiate in any part of the Temple services; he had
certain exceptional rights; and he possessed a house in the Temple,
where he lived by day, retiring only at night to his own home, which
must be within Jerusalem, and to which he was escorted by the people
after the solemnities of the Day of Atonement, which devolved almost
exclusively upon him.

Office Hereditary

Originally the office of high-priest was regarded as being held for life
and hereditary; \* but the troubles of later times made it a matter of
cabal, crime, or bribery.

\* According to the Rabbis, he was appointed by the Sanhedrim.

Without here entering into the complicated question of the succession to
the high-priesthood, the following may be quoted from the Talmud (Talmud
Jer. Ioma, I.), without, of course, guaranteeing its absolute accuracy:
‘In the first Temple, the high-priests served, the son succeeding the
father, and they were eighteen in number. But in the second Temple they
got the high-priesthood for money; and there are who say they destroyed
each other by witchcraft, so that some reckon 80 high-priests during
that period, others 81, others 82, 83, 84, and even 85.’ The Rabbis
enumerate 18 high-priests during the first Temple; Lightfoot counts 53
from the return from Babylon to Matthias, when the last war of the Jews
began; while Relandius reckons 57. But there is both difficulty and
confusion amid the constant changes at the last.

There was not any fixed age for entering on the office of high-priest,
any more than on that of an ordinary priest. The Talmudists put it down
at twenty years. But the unhappy descendant of the Maccabees,
Aristobulus, was only sixteen years of age when his beauty, as he
officiated as high-priest in the Temple, roused the jealousy of Herod,
and procured his death. The entrance of the Levites is fixed, in the
sacred text, at thirty during the wilderness period, and after that,
when the work would require less bodily strength, but a larger number of
ministers, at twenty-five years of age. \*

\* It is thus we reconcile Numbers 4:3 with 8:24, 25. In point of fact,
these two reasons are expressly mentioned in 1 Chronicles 23:24-27, as
influencing David still further to lower the age of entrance to twenty.

Disqualifications for the Priesthood

No special disqualifications for the Levitical office existed, though
the Rabbis insist that a good voice was absolutely necessary. It was
otherwise with the priest’s office. The first inquiry instituted by the
Sanhedrim, who for the purpose sat daily in ‘the Hall of Polished
Stones,’ was into the genealogy of a candidate. Certain genealogies were
deemed authoritative. Thus, ‘if his father’s name were inscribed in the
archives of Jeshana at Zipporim, no further inquiry was made.’ If he
failed to satisfy the court about his perfect legitimacy, the candidate
was dressed and veiled in black, and permanently removed. If he passed
that ordeal, inquiry was next made as to any physical defects, of which
Maimonides enumerates a hundred and forty that permanently, and
twenty-two which temporarily disqualified for the exercise of the
priestly office. Persons so disqualified were, however, admitted to
menial offices, such as in the wood-chamber, and entitled to Temple
support. Those who had stood the twofold test were dressed in white
raiment, and their names properly inscribed. To this pointed allusion is
made in Revelation 3:5, ‘He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed
in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of
life.’

The Investiture

Thus received, and afterwards instructed in his duties, the formal
admission alike of the priest and of the high-priest was not, as of old,
by anointing, but simply by investiture. For even the composition of the
sacred oil was no longer known in the second Temple. They were called
‘high-priests by investiture,’ and regarded as of inferior rank to those
‘by anointing.’ As for the common priests, the Rabbis held that they
were not anointed even in the first Temple, the rite which was applied
to the sons of Aaron being valid also for their descendants. It was
otherwise in the case of the high-priest. His investiture was continued
during seven days. In olden days, when he was anointed, the sacred oil
was not only ‘poured over him,’ but also applied to his forehead, over
the eyes, as tradition has it, after the form of the Greek letter X. The
coincidence is certainly curious. This sacred oil was besides only used
for anointing such kings as were of the family of David, not other
Jewish monarchs, and if their succession had been called in question.
Otherwise the royal dignity went, as a matter of course, by inheritance
from father to son.

The Dress of the High-Priest

The high-priests ‘by investiture’ had not any more the real Urim and
Thummim (their meaning even being unknown), though a breast-plate, with
twelve stones, was made and worn, in order to complete the eight sacred
vestments. This was just double the number of those worn by an ordinary
priest, viz. the linen breeches, the coat, the girdle, and the bonnet.
To these the high-priest added other four distinctive articles of dress,
called ‘golden vestments,’ because, unlike the robes of the ordinary
priests, gold, the symbol of splendour, appeard in them. They were the
Meil, or robe of the ephod, wholly of ‘woven work,’ of dark blue colour,
descending to the knees, and adorned at the hem by alternate blossoms of
the pomegranate in blue, purple, and scarlet, and golden bells, the
latter, according to tradition, seventy-two in number; the Ephod with
the breast-plate, the former of the four colours of the sanctuary
(white, blue, purple, and scarlet), and inwrought with threads of gold;
the Mitre; and, lastly, the Ziz, or golden frontlet. If either a priest
or the high-priest officiated without wearing the full number of his
vestments, his service would be invalid, as also if anything, however
trifling (such, for instance, as a plaster), had intervened between the
body and the dress of the priest. The material of which the four
vestments of the ordinary priest were made was ‘linen,’ or, more
accurately, ‘byssus,’ the white shining cotton-stuff of Egypt. These two
qualities of the byssus are specially marked as characteristic
(Revelation 15:6, ‘clothed in pure and shining linen.’), and on them
part of the symbolic meaning depended. Hence we read in Revelation 19:8,
‘And to her’–the wife of the Lamb made ready–‘was granted that she
should be arrayed in byssus vestments, shining and pure; for the byssus
vestment is the righteousness of the saints.’

Allusions to the Dress in the New Testament

We add some further particulars, chiefly in illustration of allusions in
the New Testament. The priest’s ‘coat’ was woven of one piece, like the
seamless robe of the Saviour (John 19:23). As it was close-fitting, the
girdle could not, strictly speaking, have been necessary. Besides,
although the account of the Rabbis, that the priest’s girdle was three
fingers broad and sixteen yards long (!), is exaggerated, no doubt it
really reached beyond the feet, and required to be thrown over the
shoulder during ministration. Hence its object must chiefly have been
symbolical. In point of fact, it may be regarded as the most distinctive
priestly vestment, since it was only put on during actual ministration,
and put off immediately afterwards. Accordingly, when in Revelation
1:13, the Saviour is seen ‘in the midst of the candlesticks,’ ‘girt
about the paps with a golden girdle,’ we are to understand by it that
our heavenly High-Priest is there engaged in actual ministry for us.
Similarly, the girdle is described as ‘about the paps,’ or (as in
Revelation 15:6) about the ‘breasts,’ as both the girdle of the ordinary
priest and that on the ephod which the high-priest wore were girded
there, and not round the loins (compare Ezekiel 44:18). Lastly, the
expression ‘golden girdle’ may bear reference to the circumstance that
the dress peculiar of the high-priest was called his ‘golden vestments,’
in contradistinction to the ‘linen vestments,’ which he wore on the Day
of Atonement.

The Breastplate/Mitre/Phylacteries

Of the four distinctive articles in the high-priest’s dress, the
breast-plate, alike from its square form and the twelve jewels on it,
bearing the names of the tribes, suggest ‘the city four-square,’ whose
‘foundations’ are twelve precious stones (Revelation 21:16,19,20). The
‘mitre’ of the high-priest differed from the head-gear of the ordinary
priest, which was shaped like the inverted calyx of a flower, in size
and probably also somewhat in shape. According to the Rabbis, it was
eight yards high (!!). Fastened to it by two (according to the Rabbis,
by three) ribbons of ‘blue lace’ was the symbol of royalty–the ‘golden
plate’ (or Ziz), on which, ‘Holiness unto Jehovah’ was graven. This
plate was only two fingers wide, and reached from temple to temple.
Between this plate and the mitre the high-priest is by some supposed to
have worn his phylacteries. But this cannot be regarded as by any means
a settled point. According to the distinct ceremony of the Talmud,
neither priests, Levites, nor the ‘stationary men’ wore phylacteries
during their actual service in the Temple. This is a strong point urged
by the modern Karaite Jews against the traditions of the Rabbis. Can it
be, that the wearing of phylacteries at the time of Christ was not a
universally acknowledged obligation, but rather the badge of a party?
This would give additional force to the words in which Christ inveighed
against those who made broad their phylacteries. According to Josephus,
the original Ziz of Aaron still existed in his time, and was carried
with other spoils to Rome. There R. Eliezer saw it in the reign of
Hadrian. Thence we can trace it, with considerable probability, through
many vicissitudes, to the time of Belisarius, and to Byzantium. From
there it was taken by order of the emperor to Jerusalem. What became of
it afterwards is unknown; possibly it may still be in existence. \*

\* When Josephus speaks of a triple crown worn by the high-priest, this
may have been introduced by the Asmoneans when they united the temporal
monarchy with the priesthood. Compare Smith’s Dictionary of the Bible,
i. 807a.

It only requires to be added that the priests’ garments, when soiled,
were not washed, but used as wicks for the lamps in the Temple; those of
the high-priest were ‘hid away.’ The high-priest wore ‘a fresh suit of
linen vestments’ each time on the Day of Atonement.

The Fourteen Officers

The priesthood ministering in the Temple were arranged into ‘ordinary’
priests and various officials. Of the latter there were, besides the
high-priest, \* the ‘Sagan,’ or suffragan priest; two ‘Katholikin,’ or
chief treasurers and overseers; seven ‘Ammarcalin,’ who were subordinate
to the Katholikin, and had chief charge of all the gates; and three
‘Gizbarin,’ or under-treasurers.

\* The Rabbis speak of a high-priest ordained ‘for war,’ who accompanied
the people to battle, but no historical trace of a distinct office of
this kind can be discovered.

These fourteen officers, ranking in the order mentioned, formed the
standing ‘council of the Temple,’ which regulated everything connected
with the affairs and services of the sanctuary. Its members were also
called ‘the elders of the priests,’ or ‘the counsellors.’ This
judicatory, which ordinarily did not busy itself with criminal
questions, apparently took a leading part in the condemnation of Jesus.
But, on the other hand, it is well to remember that they were not all of
one mind, since Joseph of Arimathea belonged to their number–the title
by which he is designated in Mark 15:43 being exactly the same word as
that applied in the Talmud to the members of this priestly council.

Their Duties

It is difficult to specify the exact duties of each of these classes of
officials. The ‘Sagan’ (or ‘Segen,’ or ‘Segan’) would officiate for the
high-priest, when from any cause he was incapacitated; he would act
generally as his assistance, and take the oversight of all the priests,
whence he is called in Scripture ‘second priest’ (2 Kings 25:18;
Jeremiah 52:24), and in Talmudical writings ‘the Sagan of the priests.’
A ‘Chananjah’ is mentioned in the Talmud as a Sagan, but whether or not
he was the ‘Annas’ of the New Testament must be left undecided. The two
Katholikin were to the Sagan what he was to the high-priest, though
their chief duty seems to have been about the treasures of the Temple.
Similarly, the seven Ammarcalin were assistants of the Katholikin,
though they had special charge of the gates, the holy vessels, and the
holy vestments; and again the three (or else seven), ‘Gizbarin’
assistants of the Ammarcalin. The title ‘Gizbar’ occurs so early as Ezra
1:8; but its exact meaning seems to have been already unknown when the
LXX translated that book. They appear to have had charge of all
dedicated and consecrated things, of the Temple tribute, of the
redemption money, etc., and to have decided all questions connected with
such matters.

Lower Officials

Next in rank to these officials were the ‘heads of each course’ on duty
for a week, and then the ‘heads of families’ of every course. After them
followed fifteen overseers, viz. ‘the overseer concerning the times,’
who summoned priests and people to their respective duties; the overseer
for shutting the doors (under the direction, of course, of the
Ammarcalin); the overseer of the guards, or captain of the Temple; the
overseer of the singers and of those who blew the trumpets; the overseer
of the cymbals; the overseer of the lots, which were drawn every
morning; the overseer of the birds, who had to provide the turtledoves
and pigeons for those who brought such offerings; the overseer of the
seals, who dispensed the four counterfoils for the various
meat-offerings suited for different sacrifices; the overseer of the
drink-offerings, for a similar purpose to the above; the overseer of the
sick, or the Temple physician; the overseer of the water, who had charge
of the water-supply and the drainage; the overseer for making the
shewbread; for preparing the incense; for making the veils; and for
providing the priestly garments. All these officers had, of course,
subordinates, whom they chose and employed, either for the day or
permanently; and it was their duty to see to all the arrangements
connected with their respective departments. Thus, not to speak of
instructors, examiners of sacrifices, and a great variety of artificers,
there must have been sufficient employment in the Temple for a very
large number of persons.

Sources of Support for the Priests

We must not close without enumerating the twenty-four sources whence,
according to the Talmud, the priests derived their support. Of these ten
were only available while in the Temple itself, four in Jerusalem, and
the remaining ten throughout the Holy Land. Those which might only be
used in the Temple itself were the priest’s part of the sin-offering;
that of the trespass-offering for a known, and for a doubtful trespass;
public peace-offerings; the leper’s log of oil; the two Pentecostal
loaves; the shewbread; what was left of meat-offerings, and the omer at
the Passover. The four which might be used only in Jerusalem were the
firstlings of beasts, the Biccurim, \* the portion from the
thank-offering (Leviticus 7:12; 22:29,30), and from the Nazarite’s goat,
and the skins of the holy sacrifices.

\* To prevent mistakes, we may state that the term ‘Therumoth’ is, in a
general way, used to designate the prepared produce, such as oil, flour,
wine; and ‘Biccurim,’ the natural product of the soil, such as corn,
fruits, etc.

Of the ten which might be used throughout the land, five could be given
at will to any priest, viz. the tithe of the tithe, the heave-offering
of the dough (Numbers 15:20; Romans 11:16), the first of the fleece and
the priest’s due of meat (Deuteronomy 18:3). The other five, it was
thought, should be given to the priests of the special course on duty
for the week, viz. the redemption-money for a first-born son, that for
an ass, the ‘sanctified field of possession’ (Leviticus 27:16), what had
been ‘devoted,’ and such possession of ‘a stranger’ or proselyte as,
having been stolen, was restored to the priests after the death of the
person robbed, with a fifth part additional. Finally, to an unlettered
priest it was only lawful to give the following from among the various
dues: things ‘devoted,’ the first-born of cattle, the redemption of a
son, that of an ass, the priest’s due (Deuteronomy 18:3), the first of
the wool, the ‘oil of burning’ (a term meaning ‘defiled Therumoth.’),
the ten things which were to be used in the Temple itself, and the
Biccurim. On the other hand, the high-priest had the right to take what
portion of the offerings he chose, and one half of the shewbread every
Sabbath also belonged to him.

Thus elaborate in every particular was the system which regulated the
admission, the services, and the privileges of the officiating
priesthood. Yet it has all vanished, not leaving behind it in the
synagogue even a single trace of its complicated and perfect
arrangements. These ‘old things are passed away,’ because they were only
‘a shadow of good things to come.’ But ‘the substance is of Christ,’ and
‘He abideth an High-Priest for ever.’
