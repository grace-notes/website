<sup>**Self-Deception**</sup>

by**Paton James Gloag**, minister of the Parish of Dunning, Blantyre and
Galashiels, early 20<sup>th</sup> century.

The greatest care and caution are necessary in examining the evidences
of our conversion. We ought to exercise a holy jealousy over ourselves,
and to avoid arriving at any definite conclusion as to the safety of our
condition, except on sure and scriptural grounds. Especially we must
beware of trusting to imaginary evidences—to evidences which may be
possessed and are possessed by the unregenerate as well as by the
regenerate. The very possibility of deception in such a momentous matter
is truly dreadful To think that we are converted, while we are still in
our natural state; to suppose ourselves the objects of God’s love, while
in reality we are exposed to His wrath; to speak peace to our souls,
when there is no peace; to imagine that we are on the narrow way to
heaven, while we are travelling along that broad way which leads to
destruction; and to continue to the end of life in this state of
deception is, as has been strikingly observed, “a mistake which requires
an eternity fully to understand, and an eternity adequately to deplore.”

The peculiar danger of self-deception consists in the extreme difficulty
of knowing when we are deceived. The avowed sinner cannot conceal his
crimes from himself; he knows that he is not safe, and that unless he
repents he must perish. The believer is ever jealous over himself; he
continually dreads lest he should not be in a state of salvation; he
examines himself carefully and only on clear evidence does he come to
any satisfactory conclusion. But self-deceivers are “pure in their own
eyes.” Their freedom from open immorality gives them confidence; the
comparison they make of themselves with others confirms them in their
delusion; their attendance at public worship, and their performance of
those religious ceremonies which custom enjoins, quiet their conscience;
the serious impressions which they once felt, but have now outgrown,
help to delude them; and thus they live a life of tranquility,
undisturbed by any fears concerning their spiritual condition,
conceiving themselves to be something, while in reality they are
nothing.

The terrors of the law do not awaken them; for they flatter themselves
that they are not exposed to its condemnation. The invitations of the
gospel do not persuade them; for they think they have already accepted
the offers of salvation. They seize upon the promises without any right,
and they look upon the threatenings as not addressed to them. Like the
church of Laodicea they think that “they are rich, and increased with
goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that they are wretched,
and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.” Their peace is like that
deceitful calm which mariners describe, the sure precursor of a storm.
The wind is hushed, the sea is calm as a lake; and while the passengers
are glad, the skilful mariners tremble; for presently the heavens are
darkened, the sea becomes troubled, the storm bursts, the thunders roll,
the lightnings flash, the billows rise like mountains, and every wave
appears as the messenger of death.

Nor let it be supposed that instances of self-deception are rare. On the
contrary, it is much to be feared that such a mistake is made by many
professing Christians, especially in this age of ceremonies, of external
decorum, and of zeal for the outward forms of religion. Men in our days
are not so chargeable with hypocrisy or with endeavoring to impose upon
others with false pretences of religion, as with self-deception,
deluding their own souls; and this is a more dangerous, as it is a more
lamentable state of matters.

I fear that it is not a mere probability, but amounts almost to a
certainty, that some who may read these pages are self-deceivers.
Conversion is not so common as many suppose. Our Savior Himself tells us
that His people are a little flock; and that the way to heaven is narrow
and difficult, while the way to hell is broad and easy. Let us soften
these statements as much as we please; let us view them in the most
favorable light; yet the conclusion at which we must arrive is, that
comparatively few are converted. If, then, we can still remain
unconcerned; if we have never any doubts at all; unless we have made
considerable progress in the Divine life, our security and insensibility
are too evident marks of self-deception.

In this chapter I propose to point out some imaginary evidences of
conversion, on which men trust for salvation, but which in reality
afford no good reasons for their confidence; marks which are found not
merely in the experience of the regenerate, but frequently in the
experience of the unregenerate, and which consequently afford no
satisfactory proof of regeneration.

I.—Many trust to their religious knowledge for salvation. Their
knowledge of religion is correct; their creed is orthodox; they have
embraced no false doctrines; and they are able to give a reason for the
faith which is in them. Now, religious knowledge is most desirable and
necessary; without it religion is apt to degenerate into superstition:
but then it is no evidence of the presence of religion in the soul. It
may be the result of education and mental application, without the
assistance or exercise of religious feelings. And indeed, when persons
have sat long under a gospel ministry; and especially when attention has
been paid to their religious education in their youth; it is impossible
that they should be altogether ignorant of Divine things. Nay, it is
quite possible that this knowledge may be accurate and minute; may
embrace the whole scheme of salvation; so that we may be able to
discourse eloquently and to reason correctly on the truths of the
gospel.

And it may not only be correct, but also in some degree founded on
conviction. We may be Christians not merely because we were born so, but
from a careful study of the evidences of Christianity. Our creed may be
pure, and we may see clearly the foundation on which each truth rests.
All this may be obtained by our own unassisted powers; but then we must
remember that it is one thing to know our duty and another thing to
practice it. The faith which saves is not the mere assent of the
understanding to any system of doctrines; but a practical principle
which leads a man to act as he believes. The doctrines of the gospel are
not like the propositions of mathematics, concerning which nothing more
is necessary than to assent to their truth; they are realities designed
to affect the heart and influence the conduct. Christianity is a remedy
which, in order to profit us, must be embraced The extent of our
knowledge, and the purity of our creed, if these have no influence over
our hearts, will no more save us than they will the devils, whose
knowledge is more extensive and whose belief is stronger than ours
“Though,” says the apostle, “I understand all mysteries and all
knowledge, and have not charity, I am nothing.”

II.—Many trust to their morality for salvation. This certainly is
preferable to bare knowledge; and indeed, properly speaking, Christian
morality and religion are one and the same thing. But what is the
morality which is so much applauded in the world? It is not the morality
of Jesus Christ; that embraces the whole law, and requires us to be
“perfect even as our Father in heaven is perfect.” But the morality of
the world consists merely in freedom from certain scandalous vices, but
includes neither faith, nor love to God, nor humility, nor patience: it
has respect to the second, rather than to the first table of the law.

We must remember that there are duties which we owe to God, as well as
duties which we owe to our fellow-men; and that the former are of more
consequence than the latter. Respect for our reputation, regard to our
interest in life, a worldly prudence, a love of approbation, a fear of
punishment whether in this world or the next, may restrain us from the
practice of scandalous vices; but these are very different from the
motives and principles which the gospel requires. The selfish man who
attends solely to his own interests, may be induced, by reason of his
very selfishness, to be moral in order to gain credit in the world. Nay,
I do not see anything to prevent an atheist from being an extremely
moral man; and I believe such instances have occurred. If, then,
morality can exist without piety, surely it is no evidence that our
salvation is sure.

More than this: a man may not only possess a good moral character, that
is, be just in his dealings, true to his word, and free from all
scandalous vices; but he may be also extremely amiable, kind to his
fellow-men, compassionate to the sorrowful, and affectionate in his
disposition; and yet be destitute of piety. Such a man is not only
respected, he is also beloved; he is not only the object of our
admiration, but of our affection. Still, however, mere amiability of
temper is a natural endowment, and therefore is no proof of a change of
heart. Such appears to have been the character of the young man in the
gospel, who came to our Savior inquiring the way of salvation. His
conduct was free from vice: he could appeal with sincerity to the moral
law, and say, “All these have I kept from my youth up;” nay, he appears
to have been of a very amiable disposition, for it is expressly said
that “Jesus beholding, loved him;” and yet this young man, so correct in
his conduct, so amiable in his disposition, so beloved by his
fellow-men, wanted one thing, and, alas, it was the one thing needful.

III.—Many trust to their regular attention to religious ordinances as
evidence of their salvation. They are a church-going people; they are
constant in attendance at the house of God; and they regularly partake
of the sacrament of the Supper. All this may be well, so far as it goes.
But then it is not conversion. Custom enjoins men to attend the public
worship of the sanctuary; completely to neglect it would lessen their
character in the world. But, surely, religion is something very
different from the mere performance of its outward rites and ceremonies.
There were none more exact in this respect than the Pharisees; they
prayed thrice a-day and fasted twice a-week; they gave tithes of all
that they possessed, even of the smallest trifles, as mint, and anise,
and cummin; and yet our Savior calls them “serpents and a generation of
vipers;” and surely what was no evidence of religion in them can be no
evidence of religion in us. Yea, our Savior expressly says, “Except your
righteousness exceed that of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no
case enter into the kingdom of heaven.”

Still further, there may not only be attendance on the public ordinances
of religion, but also some degree of attention paid to private devotion;
and yet there may be no true religion. This is indeed a more favorable
symptom; and if there be fervor and sincerity in the performance of
secret prayer, it is a good evidence of piety. But then it is evident
that private devotion may degenerate into formality, and be the result
of mere habit. We may have been taught in childhood to offer up our
morning and evening prayers; or we may, as the result of religious
impressions, long since passed away, have set apart stated times for
private prayer; but it is quite possible that these religious exercises
may be mere formal observances; the utterance of certain words with the
tongue, while our thoughts are wandering on other subjects; and thus
instead of being acts of devotion, they become a profanation of the name
of God. It is spiritual worship which God demands: it is the homage of
the heart, and not the adoration of the lips, which He requires. “Not
every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
Many will say unto me, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name 1
and in Thy name have cast out devils 1 and in Thy name done many
wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you;
depart from me, ye that work iniquity.”

IV.—Many substitute for religion an attachment to the particular
denomination of Christians to which they belong, and trust for salvation
to their religious zeal. But zeal for a particular sect is not zeal for
religion; and attachment to a particular tenet is not attachment to the
truth. We may consider that we belong to the purest denomination in the
world, and in the excess of our bigotry suppose that salvation is
difficult beyond the pale of our church. We may be intolerant to those
who differ from us, and in the intemperance of our zeal lose sight of
charity. But let us not deceive ourselves with supposing that bigotry,
intolerance, and party zeal bear any resemblance to the religion of the
gospel Even allowing that the church to which we belong is superior to
all others in purity, yet if this does not produce a corresponding
beneficial effect on our heart and conduct, our connection with it will
only increase our guilt by adding to our other sins the abuse of such
privileges, and the resistance of so much knowledge. He who knew his
Master’s will, and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes. “Trust
not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, the temple of the
Lord are these.” At the day of judgment, it shall no more be asked to
what church we belonged than in what country we were born. All human
distinctions of sects and denominations shall then be for ever
abolished, and men shall be divided into only two classes—the disciples
of Christ, and the partisans of the world; the children of grace, and
the children of nature; the future inhabitants of heaven and of hell .
is evident that a partial reformation is quite consistent with a total
want of religion. The same reasons which induce a man to be moral also
induce him to correct the irregularities of his conduct. Age also may
have weakened the strength of his passions, or his health may have been
injured by intemperance. And, indeed, it often happens that what a man
calls the reformation of his conduct may only be the exchange of one
vice for another; from being intemperate when young, he may become
covetous when old. God demands the heart for His service; there can be
no compromise between Him and sin; no man can serve two such masters,
whose services are so opposite, whose commands are so much at variance.
To be religious, our obedience must be sincere; we must harbor no known
sin, nor habitually and willfully neglect the performance of any duty.
“Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is
guilty of all.”

[…]

VI.—Many trust to their religious impressions. This is, perhaps, the
most fruitful source of self-deception. Some, for example, place
confidence in the strong convictions which they at one time had of the
evil of sin, and of the danger to which it exposed them. They tell us of
the tears they shed, of the agonies they endured, and of the awful sense
they had of the wrath of God. Now, conviction of sin is very important
and essential: it always, in some degree or other, precedes conversion.
Until we see ourselves lost, we will never truly come to the Savior for
salvation. Until we feel our disease, we will never betake ourselves to
the remedy. We must not then despise these convictions, but nourish and
cherish them as the motions of the Holy Ghost—as mercifully designed to
awaken us out of our false security. But the great error lies in
mistaking conviction for conversion. A man may tremble at the
remembrance of his sins and at the prospect of the judgment to come, and
yet never be converted. It is one thing to know our danger, and another
thing actually to flee for refuge; it is one thing to see our sins, and
another thing to betake ourselves to the Savior. Convictions may arise,
and frequently do arise, from natural causes. There are probably few
hearers of the gospel who have not at one period of their lives been
subject to these religious influences. But how often do these
impressions wear away: how often do they prove as “the morning cloud and
the early dew” which vanish before the rising sun. Like the stony ground
hearers, we may have received the word with joy, but endured only for a
time, and then have fallen from the faith. We may have healed our wounds
slightly, saying, “Peace, peace,” when there is no peace. And perhaps
the result of these convictions with respect to us may have been to
nourish our self-deception, and to render our state more dangerous and
alarming than it was before. “For if,” says St Peter, “after we have
escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ, we are again entangled therein and overcome,
the latter end is worse with us than the beginning. For it had been
better for us not to have known the way of righteousness, than after we
have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto us.”
Felix trembled when Paul reasoned with him of righteousness, temperance,
and a judgment to come; and even Ahab, the profane king of Israel,
humbled himself and put on sackcloth under the denunciations of the
prophet. Such also was the grief of Judas; so violent were his
convictions that he could no longer support them; they drove him to
despair, and caused him to put an end to his miserable existence.

VII.—Many trust to their good works for salvation. Good works, when
performed from proper motives, are sure signs of a spiritual change;
they are the good fruits of a good tree. But works are only good in the
sight of God when they are performed from religious motives; if the
motive be wrong, the work, however advantageous it may be to man, ceases
to be virtuous. Now it is evident that a man may perform many good works
without being actuated by religious principles. We may support
charitable and religious enterprises merely from ostentation; from a
desire, like the Pharisees, to appear religious and to obtain the praise
of men. Or a constitutional tenderness of heart, a natural sympathy with
the misfortunes of others, an instinctive kindness of disposition may
induce us to relieve the wants of the miserable. We may also think that
by performing good works we may merit heaven; and thus we may exceed
even the people of God in them, merely from a principle of
self-righteousness—from a desire, as it were, to purchase the Divine
favor; and thus being ignorant of God’s righteousness, or from pride and
self-love, we may go about, like the Jews of old, to establish our own
righteousness, not submitting ourselves to the righteousness of God; and
hence our good works, instead of being acceptable in the sight of a holy
and heart-searching God, become positively sinful—the offspring of a
corrupt and depraved heart. “Though,” says the apostle, “I bestow all my
goods to feed the poor, and have not charity, I am nothing.”

So far then a man may go, and yet be destitute of true religion. But
wherein, it will be asked, does such a man fall short? Here is a man who
has right notions of religion; who is a believer in Christianity, not
merely because he was born so, but from conviction; who is blameless in
his morals and amiable in his disposition; who is regular in his
attendance at public worship, and even attentive to private devotion;
who is sincere and even zealous in his attachment to the church to which
he belongs; who has reformed many things that were formerly amiss; who
has had many serious impressions —convictions of the evil of sin and of
the danger to which he is exposed; and who is liberal to the poor, and a
supporter of charitable and religious institutions: and yet it is
asserted that, notwithstanding all this, such a man may not be a true
Christian. What can be wanting in such a character? What is wanting?
Why, the very soul of religion is wanting. If the man has nothing more
than what I have described, I again solemnly assert that he is not a
regenerate man; that all his religion, his ceremonies, and good works
are vain. He wants spiritual life: he is, as the Scriptures emphatically
express it, “dead in trespasses and in sins.” There is wanting a heart
loving God and delighting in His commandments. There is wanting a
sincerity in religion; the man is only half a Christian; he is serving
two masters—God and the world. There is wanting a living faith in Jesus
Christ, not a mere speculative belief in the truths of Christianity, but
a humble renouncing of self, and a simple confidence in the merits of
the Savior.

Do I address any who fear that they are deceiving themselves; any who
feel that they belong to any one of these classes of self-deceivers whom
I have mentioned? Your case is most distressing, most worthy of tears.
You are not far from the kingdom of God, and will you at length fall
short of it? You have reformed your outward conduct; you are regular in
your attendance on public ordinances; you neglect not the devotion of
the closet; you perform good works; you have been the subjects of
religious impressions; and will you rest satisfied with being “almost a
Christian?” Have you performed so many things in vain? And will you not
be decided? You are not even called to more labor; you are required to
perform almost the same things which you already do, but only to perform
them with greater earnestness and from purer motives. And will you, for
want of this, render useless all your efforts? If I could only persuade
you to a greater degree of spirituality, your religious exercises would
become easier; your secret prayers would be transformed from being an
irksome task, as they must now be when your heart is not engaged in
them, to be a delightful privilege, a foretaste of the pleasures of
heaven.

I conclude this chapter with a few advices of a practical nature.

Carefully examine yourselves. I would exhort you to spend some time in
retirement for religious purposes. This, I have supposed, you do not
altogether neglect, but that you already pay some attention to private
devotion. Now, at these seasons think on the state of your soul in the
sight of God; compare your character with that of the righteous as
recorded in His Word; and do not rest satisfied until you perceive in
your soul the Scriptural marks of regeneration. “Examine yourselves
whether ye be in the faith: know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus
Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates.”

Be much engaged in earnest prayer. Your prayers hitherto may have been a
mere form; you may have gone through them as a task; but henceforth be
in earnest about religion; trifle not in your approaches to the throne
of grace, remembering that “God is a Spirit; and they who worship Him
must worship Him in spirit and in truth.” Is the salvation of your soul
a thing to trifle with? Is a crown of glory—a kingdom—a thing to ask in
a cold and formal manner? Pray for pardon, as a criminal condemned to
death. Pray for salvation, as one exposed to endless misery.

Search the Scriptures. Let your hours of secret devotion be divided
between prayer and the perusal of God’s Word. Read the Scriptures, not
with the mind of a scholar, but of a Christian; not in order to
criticize them, but to find out what God requires. At other times you
may read them for the sake of your intellectual improvement, and they
are well worthy of such a perusal; but in those hours which are
consecrated to your religious improvement, you ought solely to be intent
upon the practical bearing which they may have upon you.

Attend diligently to the ordinances of religion. At present you may go
to the house of God, and take your seat at the communion table, merely
because custom enjoins you. But henceforth go to meet with God Himself
in His ordinances, to hear what He has to say to you, and to attend
solely to the interests of your immortal soul. “I will go to the altar
of God,” says the Psalmist, “unto God, my exceeding joy.” The preaching
of the word is the instrument which the Spirit generally makes use of in
arousing the unconcerned, in converting the unconverted, and in
strengthening the graces and mortifying the corruptions of believers.

Guard against worldliness. This world is the great rival of God in the
hearts of men. Beware, then, of fixing your affections upon it; of
making some worldly object, whether it be riches, or fame, or domestic
comfort, the chief aim of life; or, in other words, of allowing
selfishness to be the ruling principle of your conduct. The gospel
requires us to deny ourselves, and to take up the cross. We must live to
Christ, else we cannot be His disciples.

Give yourselves over unto God in an everlasting covenant through Jesus
Christ. Meditate well upon what you are about: that you must renounce
the world and self, and serve God with all the members of your body and
with all the faculties of your soul. Let this, then, be the language of
your heart:—" Lord, I heartily accept the free offers of salvation
through Jesus Christ: I take Thee for my covenant God and Father; I take
Christ in all His offices to save me—as my Prophet to instruct me, as my
Priest to intercede for me, as my King to rule over me; I take the Holy
Spirit for my Sanctifier; I take Thy word for the rule of my life, Thy
glory for the end of my existence, heaven for my eternal home, and the
enjoyment of Thee for my chief good."

Thus make religion the great duty of your lives, and the service of God
the great work which is given you to do. “Every way of a man is right in
his own eyes; but the Lord ponders the heart.” Remember that you have to
do with a heart-searching God, whose eye pierces through all coverings,
whom no outward appearances can deceive, who sees your true character,
and who will assign you your proper place in another world.

“0 Lord, Thou who seest the hearts of all the children of men, suffer us
not to impose upon ourselves, awaken us out of our false security, that,
seeing the danger to which we are exposed, and the number and
aggravations of our sins, we may be inclined and enabled to embrace the
gracious offers of the gospel, that so we may obtain a peace, of which
the world cannot deprive us, and which death itself can neither disturb
nor destroy.”
