# I. Political and Constitutional History, 1603 to 1629

From *The Early Stuarts, 1603 to 1660,* by Godfrey Davies, Oxford
University History of England

ELIZABETH I died early on 24 March 1603, but not before she had
signified that James VI of Scotland should succeed her. The privy
council at once issued a proclamation of the Scottish king’s accession
as James I of England, in a form to which he had previously assented.
His peaceful accession was welcomed with practical unanimity, and, we
are told, ‘the like joy, both in London and all parts of England, was
never known’. The king spent a month on his progress from Edinburgh to
London, and the first impressions his new subjects gained were
favourable. His familiarity and courtesy were praised on every side, and
his zeal for hunting endeared him at once to many. The gentry who
flocked to see him were rewarded by knighthoods, with a profusion far in
excess of any previous grants.

James VI, born in 1566 and crowned king of Scotland the next year, began
to reign formally in 1578 and actually in 1583. Educated by George
Buchanan, the Scottish humanist, he became one of the most learned of
kings, especially in theology, his main interest. His knowledge did not
broaden his mind but made him pedantic and pedagogic. Throughout his
life he aspired to instruct his subjects and wrote treatises and
delivered speeches to teach them the obedience they owed to God’s
vicegerent on earth. His precocious self-conceit increased with his
success in suppressing the disorders in the Western Isles and along the
Border and in attacking presbyterianism. He accepted the presbyterian
doctrine but hated the discipline as incompatible with his theories of
divine right. His confidence in his statecraft grew after his peaceful
succession to the English throne because he attributed it to his
intrigues with English statesmen and continental rulers. It was really
due to heredity and the absence of any suitable alternative. From an
early age in Scotland until his death in England he felt a strange
infatuation for favourites chosen for their youth, graceful and handsome
figures, and willingness to flatter their master. His habit of fondling
them, and especially Buckingham, in public gave rise to suspicions of
baser intimacies in private, but these are not proved. Naturally
indolent, he could concentrate on business only for short periods. He
was at best in a small circle of intimates when his learning and pawky
wit enlivened conversation: he was at his worst on state occasions
because he wholly lacked kingly dignity.

James determined to make no radical changes among the ministers who had
served Elizabeth. He had already assured Cecil that he regarded him as
his principal upholder, and continued him in office as chief adviser.
The choice was the best possible, and until his death, in 1612, Cecil
restrained the king from such graver follies as then followed.
Unfortunately, however, Cecil, for all his integrity, tireless industry,
and administrative skill, could do little more than project into the
future the worn-out ideals of the past. He was, like his royal master,
totally unable to appreciate the aims or principles of those who
differed from him, and could never understand either Bacon or Raleigh.
In common with most sublime mediocrities, he distrusted original ideas
of every kind, and never perceived that a changing world demanded
policies far different from those in which he had been trained at the
court of Elizabeth. At a time when the centre of political gravity was
rapidly shifting, he left no mark at all upon constitutional history. An
observation his cousin, Francis Bacon, is reputed to have made to James
I exactly sums up his place in the national annals: ‘I do think he was
no fit counsellor to make your affairs better; but yet he was fit to
have kept them from growing worse’.

It is highly significant that one consequence of the king’s retention of
Cecil as his chief minister was the dismissal of Raleigh from his post
as captain of the guard, though a generous pecuniary compensation was
provided. Disappointed ambition prompted Raleigh to listen to, though
probably not to take an active part in, a wild project of Cobham’s to
supplant James by his cousin, Arabella Stuart, an English-born
descendant of Margaret, daughter of Henry VII, from whom the king’s
title was derived. For this Raleigh was tried, found guilty, and
condemned to death, but reprieved and confined in the Tower. From a
modern standard his trial was unfair, and posterity has reversed
unanimously the contemporary verdict. Most of the blame must be laid to
the procedure then followed in criminal trials, but Sir Edward Coke
conducted the prosecution with a ferocity perhaps unequalled in English
courts of law until the time of Jeffreys and the ‘Bloody Assize’.

Another sign of the times was revealed at the beginning of 1604, when
James issued a proclamation for the choice of members of parliament,
because in it he directed that all election returns should be made into
chancery, where any found contrary to the proclamation would be rejected
as unlawful. This order was responsible for the first of many
disagreements between king and parliament. When the houses met, the
unusually large attendance testified to the importance men attached to
the occasion. From James’s opening speech the future of the reign might
have been foretold, for it disclosed at once the wide gulf fixed between
the royal policy and public opinion. After eulogies on the peace with
Spain and the union of the crowns of England and Scotland, the king
passed to religion. He praised the church of England, but regretted the
existence of two bodies that refused to live within its folds. The
puritans and ‘novelists’ he denounced for ‘being ever discontented with
the present government, and impatient to suffer any superiority; which
maketh their sect unable to be suffered in any well-governed
commonwealth’. Turning to the Roman catholics, he acknowledged theirs to
be the mother church, although defiled by some infirmities and
corruptions. The leniency he had already shown proved that he was
against persecution, but he could not tolerate priests within his
kingdom so long as they upheld the papal claim to dethrone princes and
approved the assassination of heretical rulers.

Before proceeding to other business, the commons took up two cases of
privilege. The one finally secured freedom of members from arrest except
for treason, felony, or breach of the peace. Shirley, a member, had been
arrested for debt and held in the Fleet, and it was not until the warden
of that prison had been committed to the Tower and acts of parliament
asserting that members had always enjoyed this privilege had received
the royal assent that Shirley was released to take his seat. The other
was of greater importance, for it produced the first clash between king
and parliament. In the Buckinghamshire election Goodwin, an outlaw, had
defeated Fortescue, but the court of chancery had declared the election
void, and Fortescue was then chosen at a by-election. The house at once
summoned Goodwin, and after hearing his statement ordered him to take
his seat. James thereupon intervened and told the commons that, since
all their privileges were derived from him, he did not expect them to be
used against himself. Under the law, the house ought not to meddle with
returns, which should be sent to chancery and there corrected if they
needed it. The commons then realized that the question had suddenly
assumed a new significance–that Goodwin versus Fortescue had become the
case of the whole kingdom. The commons therefore maintained a firm but
conciliatory attitude, and at length James, after commanding them ‘as an
absolute king’ to hold a conference with the judiciary, gave way and
admitted that they were the proper judges of their own returns, while
they in gratitude ordered the issue of a new writ for Buckinghamshire.
There can be no doubt that the commons had won their first skirmish with
prerogative.

The commons then passed to the discussion of some practical grievances,
such as purveyance and wardship. Both were relics of feudalism and both
had long survived the reasons for their original existence. In a
petition the commons summed up at length the case against purveyance, of
which Bacon said to James: ‘There is no grievance in your kingdom so
general, so continual, so sensible, and so bitter unto the common
subject.’ They mentioned that, in spite of thirty-six or more laws
prohibiting the abuse of this privilege, there were still many
grievances: that those responsible for requisitioning carts habitually
demanded a number far beyond the requirement and exacted money before
discharging those not wanted; that victuals and firing were taken at a
price not greater than a fourth part of the true value, and that not in
ready money; and that warrants were sent for excessive quantities of
hay, straw, and oats of which the carriage alone often cost the subject
twice as much as he received for his produce. In seeking the support of
the lords, the commons struck a snag, for they found that there the
opinion was held that compensation to the amount of £50,000 per annum
should be granted. This raised a most important question of principle,
for the commons felt that, if purveyance was abused, there was no reason
why compensation should be granted for the surrender by the Crown of
these abuses; while the lords, voicing the opinion of the Crown, assumed
that, as the royal revenue was already inadequate for the king’s needs,
no source should be abandoned unless an alternative were offered. There
was much to be said for both sides, for unquestionably the Stuart
monarchs, although extravagant, were never in possession of sufficient
revenue to perform the functions pertinent to their office. On the other
hand, instead of presenting the issue fairly to parliament, they
preferred either to try to drive a hard bargain with the national
representatives or to rely upon extra-legal devices to fill their
coffers.

Wardship was in a position somewhat different from that of purveyance.
The right of the king to the wardship of tenantsin-chief who were
minors, to take the land of a minor into his own hand, to pocket the
profits, and to arrange the marriage of an heiress under age, was
unquestionable in point of law. But, here again, the legal right
flourished long after the feudal duties that had once justified it had
vanished. The court of wards had already become an obnoxious anachronism
and a source of annoyance and expense to landowners. Fathers, in making
their wills, had to face the difficulty of providing for the purchase
from the king, or his officers, of the wardships of their children; and
a faithful servant of the Crown, like Strafford, hoped that he might be
rewarded with the wardship of his own son. Moreover an odious traffic
in the rights of wardship developed, often to the enrichment of greedy
courtiers. In this case the commons, recognizing that the system was
legal, offered to provide, in another way, a larger revenue than the
king had ever obtained from the court of wards, but, instead of thanks,
received one of the frequent scoldings that the king, ‘as a father to
his children’, was wont to inflict upon them.

The result was the Apology of the House of Commons, which is a
statement, couched in firm, dutiful language, of parliamentary
privileges and a defence of the proceedings in the lower house. It
deserves the closest study, both because it reveals the position the
commons took up and maintained for the next forty years–that their
privileges were the general liberties of England–and because it was an
authoritative pronouncement of the reforms or changes deemed necessary
at the beginning of the new reign. After the statement that their
privileges had been ‘more universally and dangerously impugned than ever
(as we suppose) since the beginnings of parliaments’, the commons point
out that freedom of election had been attacked and freedom of speech
prejudiced by reproofs. Therefore they must protest, they say, because
‘the prerogatives of princes may easily, and daily grow [while] the
privileges of the subject are for the most part at an everlasting
stand’. They declare that the liberties of the commons of England
consist chiefly in free election, freedom from arrest during
parliamentary sessions, and freedom of speech, and assert that these
privileges are their right and due inheritance. As regards religion,
they deny that the king could make any alterations or laws except by
consent of parliament. They had not come, they say, in any puritan
spirit to attempt the subversion of the ecclesiastical status quo, but,
for the sake of peace and unity, ask that ‘some few ceremonies of small
importance’ might be abandoned. After mentioning purveyance and
wardship, they conclude by stating that ‘the voice of the people, in the
things of their knowledge, is said to be as the voice of God’.
Apparently the Apology was never presented to the king, but it stands on
record as an undelivered ‘lecture to a foreign king on the
constitutional customs of the realm which he had come to govern, but
which he so imperfectly understood’.

On the other hand there is little doubt that a copy of the petition
reached the king’s hands, for, in his speech at the prorogation, he
scornfully observed that it was easy to make apologies when no man was
present to answer them. His main complaint was that in the parliament
there was ‘nothing but curiosity, from morning to evening, to find fault
with my propositions’, and that he had not been accorded due respect.
Here, like all the Stuarts, James was treating expressions of national
grievances as if they were personal insults. He seems to have regarded
parliamentary complaints as breaches of good manners, and persistence in
the redress of grievances as disloyalty. His attitude towards the
national representatives was both paternal and contemptuous. Like a
father, he wished his people to believe that whatever he did was for
their good; but the thesis that their representatives should decide what
was good or bad for the country was rank sedition to him. Criticism
seemed to emanate either from ‘idle heads’ or disloyal hearts. There was
thus no sympathy between king and parliament because there was no
understanding.

Disagreement on religion was greater than on any other question.
Probably the sentiments of the majority in parliament were voiced in the
puritan appeal, presented to the king on his first entrance into
England, which has become known as the Millenary Petition. At the
resultant Hampton Court conference James’s determination not to accede
to the moderate demands for relaxation of ceremonial, and his
declaration that he would make puritans conform, were fatal obstacles to
a good understanding with parliament. In the Apology the commons had
hoped that the relinquishment of a few ceremonies of slight importance
would secure a perpetual uniformity, but James and Bancroft (who was
nominated archbishop of Canterbury in October 1604) meant to achieve
unity by the rigid enforcement of the law.

Another difficulty in the way of a good understanding between king and
parliament was presented by the catholic question. James, hankering
after a union with Rome, was averse to gratifying his protestant
subjects by a uniform enforcement of the penal code, and treated
catholics according to dynastic or personal, rather than national or
religious, considerations. By alternately permitting and relaxing
persecution he created distrust among protestants and failed to win the
confidence of catholics. The occasional martyrdom of priests and the
more frequent exaction of recusancy fines made some of the bolder
catholics despair of any lasting alleviation of their cruel lot. The
result was the Gunpowder Treason or Plot. A small band headed by Robert
Catesby hired a cellar under the houses of parliament, had it well
stored with barrels of gunpowder, and arranged for Guy Fawkes to apply
the torch. They hoped that if king, lords, and commons were all blown
up, they might profit by the inevitable confusion among protestants to
seize the reins of government. Their plot failed completely, but it
inevitably deepened the national hatred against them, and increased the
severity of the penal code.

The next parliamentary session began under the shadow of the Gunpowder
Plot, and was adjourned immediately after a speech from the throne, in
which James tried to enlighten his hearers by enlarging upon the true
nature of monarchy, declaring that kings were God’s ‘vice-gerents on
earth, and so adorned and furnished with some sparkles of the
Divinitie’, and upon the function of parliament: ‘Neither is this a
place . . . for every rash and harebrained fellow to propone new lawes
of his owne invention.’ Nevertheless, when parliament assembled again,
there was an unwonted harmony between king and estates: a generous
financial grant was made, and an act, passed in the previous session, to
appoint commissioners representing England and Scotland to treat of a
union between the two kingdoms, was extended.

The proposed union was the main topic of discussion in the third session
( 1606-7). In his opening speech James strongly urged the importance of
the union, and stressed three essentials: that all existing laws framed
to provide for possible hostilities between the two kingdoms might be
abrogated; that free trade should be established; and that those of his
subjects born before his accession to the English Crown might be
considered naturalized. When these preliminaries are completed the two
nations ‘shall ever acknowledge one church and one king; and be joined,
in a perpetual marriage, for the peace and prosperity of both nations,
and for the honour of their king’. The ideal that James set before
parliament was not destined to be realized for another century. The old
hatred between England and Scotland had become less vehement but was
still strong. Englishmen knew little of Scotland and cared less. Many
of the English despised the Scots as a nation of beggarly peasants or
pedlars, or simply as men living by robbery or treachery. James’s
generosity to favourites whose sole merit was their nationality had made
Scots more unpopular than ever, and it was easy to represent them as
greedy adventurers who would devour the land like so many boars.

The debates naturally turned on the question of free trade and
naturalization. The London merchants protested that they would be ruined
by the competition of Scots, who would be on hand whenever a bargain was
to be made but would disappear across the border when taxes became due.
Similarly the trading companies would soon be filled by Scots, and
Englishmen deprived of a living. These and other arguments were utilized
in the commons, where violent speeches abusing the Scots were listened
to without disapproval until the king protested. In vain Bacon urged
that England was not so overpopulated that the influx of a few Scots
would make any real difference, that naturalization must precede any
attempt to assimilate the laws of the two countries, and that to join
them had been the lifelong effort of Edward I, one of the greatest
English kings. He cited examples from classical as well as modern
European history, to prove how beneficial unions similar to the one in
question had proved, but his hearers remained unconvinced. They closed
their ears to the opinion of the legal advisers of the Crown, that by
the common law the Post-nati (the name given to those born in Scotland
after James’s accession) were ipso facto naturalized. They took up the
position that they would have a ‘perfect union’ or nothing. By this they
meant, as Sir Edwin Sandys stated, an incorporating union under which
there would be one parliament and one law for both kingdoms.

In view of the strength of the national prejudice, James had perforce to
abandon his well-meant plan, and be content with the verdict at a
collusive legal action, usually known as Calvin’s case, by which it
was declared that the Post-nati were naturalborn subjects of the king of
England. Coke recognized that the action was ‘the weightiest for the
consequent, both for the present and for all posterity’; and in fact, as
the historian of English law states, it made ‘a uniform status for
natural-born subjects, not only in England and Scotland, but also in the
many lands which, in the succeeding centuries, were added to the king’s
dominions’.

This use of the law-courts to declare as already existing law what
parliament was unwilling to enact, was capable of dangerous extension.
Both the first Stuarts were prone to appeal to the judges for
confirmation of their own interpretations of legal points, and to regard
them as natural upholders of the prerogative. This was the more serious
inasmuch as there were many vital questions about which the law was not
clear, for precedents might be cited on both sides. An example of
extreme importance was now afforded of the prejudice a subject might
suffer by the legal interpretation of a disputed right of taxation.

The case was that of John Bate, a merchant, who refused to pay a customs
duty on currants. The previous history of this duty is somewhat
complicated. Elizabeth had first granted a monopoly for the importation
of currants from Venice, which then largely controlled the Levant trade.
Later, when the Levant Company was formed, it had permitted non-members
to import currants on payment of 5s. 6d. per hundredweight, but the
company did not prosper, and, after various schemes had been tried, its
charter was surrendered, at the beginning of James’s reign, and the
trade thrown open, though an imposition was levied upon importation.
Even so, the king had to remit arrears of duties amounting to C 13,000
to the merchants. However, when Bate had a cartload of currants driven
from the waterside before examination by the customs official and
declared to the council that he had so acted because he believed the
imposition to be illegal, the government decided to bring the whole
question formally before the court of exchequer. The decision of Chief
Baron Fleming is worthy of the closest analysis, inasmuch as it presents
a theory of the royal prerogative widely held and long continuing. The
impositions, he said, were duties newly levied by the king, without
parliamentary authority, in order to augment his revenues. A king’s
power is both ordinary and absolute, and differs according to the ends
it serves. The ordinary power concerns individuals, the execution of
civil justice, and the determining of meum; is exercised in the ordinary
courts of law according to common law; and is subject to parliament. The
absolute power exists for the general benefit of the whole people, is
governed by rules of policy, and varies according to what the wisdom of
the king thinks is for the common good. Since all customs duties, be
they old or new, are simply ‘the effects and issues’ of foreign trade,
and since all foreign affairs, including commerce, are controlled by the
absolute power of the king, impositions are rightly levied by this
extraordinary prerogative. So far as foreign commodities are concerned,
no act of parliament or petition was ever made against an impost upon
alien goods, but the tax had been paid.

On the whole, although Fleming’s statement about the absolute or
extraordinary prerogative of the Crown was capable of dangerous
extension, he seems to have made it clear that this power was reserved
for the regulation of foreign commerce, and his decision did not
countenance its use solely for taxative purposes. The distinction he
drew, by inference, between a duty to raise money and one to control
trade, was probably sound according to precedent. Both Elizabeth and
James had clearly been more concerned to foster trade with the Levant
than to raise a revenue from it. And the judgement in Bate’s case
apparently gave a legal justification for their policies. It was not the
fault of the legal authorities concerned if James stretched the decision
to cover additional impositions that were levied merely in order to
increase the royal revenue.

To Salisbury, the treasurer, this decision seemed a godsend, and he
proceeded to lay new impositions on merchandise, though he was careful
to make them as little onerous as possible and acted only after
consulting the chief city merchants. Since the estimated yield of the
new levies was £70,000, and the possibilities of raising further revenue
from this source were not yet exhausted, the danger that the king might
secure an adequate income independent of parliament was very real.
Therefore it was natural that when parliament reassembled in 1610
impositions should be called in question. Salisbury explained in some
detail the state of the national finances: that in spite of unparalleled
exertions by which £700,000 of debt had been paid off, there was still
owing £300,000, and that the revenue fell short of the requirements by
£50,000, without allowing for extraordinary expenses. Members, however,
were not impressed and they evinced more zeal for checking the
prodigality of the court than for voting additional taxes. Wentworth’s
speech is probably typical of the general sentiments: that it was
useless to grant any more supplies unless the king would resume the
pensions he had given to courtiers and reduce his own expenses. ‘For his
part . . . he would never give his consent to take money from a poore
frize jerkyn to trappe a courtier’s horse with all.’ He was in favour of
petitioning His Majesty to practise economy and to live of his own
without further exactions from his poor subjects, especially in a time
of peace. Otherwise, a precedent of Richard II’s reign might be
followed, when the king’s excessive gifts and extravagance caused the
appointment of a council to inquire into these excesses.

Other speakers were more eager to remove grievances, such as monopolies,
purveyance, and wardship, than to suggest ways to make good the loss
their abolition would entail. The unwillingness of the commons to grant
an income that would have made the king largely independent of
parliament was probably increased when attention was called to a law
dictionary, The Interpreter, compiled by John Cowell. In this book the
royal authority is enhanced to the highest point, and its writer leaves
the impression that in his opinion the king is absolute and above the
laws, and only admits the concurrence in legislation of the three
estates through his benignity or by reason of his coronation oath.
Before there was time to prepare an address, the king prudently sent a
message to the two houses in which he disavowed the theory of the
prerogative, as set forth by Cowell, and acknowledged that he had no
power either to make laws or levy subsidies without parliamentary
assent. He therefore ordered the suppression of the obnoxious volume.

After this interruption, attention once again centred on the state of
the royal income. The commons were now willing that compensation should
be given to the king in return for his surrender of all he received from
feudal tenures except aids, but they offered only when twice that amount
was demanded by the court. They declined to proceed, and, instead, began
to consider grievances (among them impositions). Forbidden to discuss
them and told by James that he would not have his prerogative called in
question, the commons engaged in an animated debate, in which claims
were advanced that members might discuss any subject that concerned the
welfare of the kingdom. Accordingly a petition was drawn up and., unlike
the Apology, entered in full in the journal. The commons now asserted
that parliament enjoyed the ancient and undoubted right to debate freely
all matters affecting the subject, and sought permission to make a
thorough examination of the new imposi tions. Thereupon James. drew
back, admitting that impositions were proper subjects for parliamentary
inquiry. Accordingly a discussion of unusual length and gravity ensued,
in the course of which the issue was fairly stated by a legal antiquary,
William Hakewill: ’The question now in debate amongst us is, whether His
Majesty may, by prerogative royal, without assent of parliament, at
his own will and pleasure, lay a new charge or imposition upon
merchandises, to be brought into, or out of this kingdome of England,,
and enforce merchants to pay the same? The same speaker, in an
exhaustive examination of precedents, made out a good case against the
right of the Crown to levy new customs for revenue purposes, and the
general feeling of the house was clearly with him. Therefore Salisbury
once more tried to arrange a compromise and eventually succeeded in
inducing the commons to offer £200,000. In a memorial the commons
stated the concessions they expected from the king in return for the
increased revenue he would receive. Purveyance, wardship, and other
feudal relics were to be abolished (except aids, restricted in amount to
£25,000), and possession of an estate for sixty years was to be a
sufficient title against the king and his heirs. Four English counties
now subject to the jurisdiction of the council of Wales were henceforth
to be exempt therefrom.

In his answer, delivered just before the prorogation, James took up
other grievances as well as those mentioned above. He dealt at some
length with various alleged ecclesiastical abuses, but, although his
tone was conciliatory, he refused to promise more than that he would
examine each point carefully and frame such remedies as his princely
wisdom suggested. However adroitly he might contrive his answer to the
commons’ petitions, his feeling obviously was that ecclesiastical
questions were no fit subjects for parliamentary interference, and that
he meant jealously to safeguard his supremacy. Similarly, in touching
upon the proposed restriction of the council of Wales, he would only
promise to consider the matter. In other words his attitude was that
the commons after bringing grievances to his notice should thenceforth
be content to leave their redress to him.

When parliament reassembled, the commons began to discuss the king’s
answer to their memorial, and it soon became evident that there was
every intention to insist on a more definite and satisfactory response.
On the other hand James now thought the proposed bargain unacceptable,
and insisted that a grant should be made to pay his debts and also that
his additional revenue should be augmented by another C i oo,ooo. The
result of these fresh demands was to stiffen opposition, and there were
plain speeches delivered against the Scottish favourites and the
extravagance of the court. At last James lost patience and first
adjourned and then dissolved parliament. Thereupon the Cgreat contract’
vanished into oblivion.

The history of this first parliament of James I is most important as the
prototype of many others. During its sessions the Tudor system of
government had been on trial and its inadequacy was exposed. James had
failed partly because he lacked the personality of his famous
predecessor. Yet it is very doubtful whether even Queen Elizabeth could
have succeeded, for both these sovereigns regarded parliament as an
unwelcome and intrusive body that had to be cajoled by occasional
concessions into granting much-needed subsidies. It was, they felt, a
nuisance born of financial necessities. Consequently they directed all
their efforts to excluding the estates from any share in administration
and listened to criticisms only when they either became unusually
vehement or when the fiscal situation was especially serious. There are
other, less fundamental reasons why James failed to control parliament
as successfully as Elizabeth. He allowed the dominant position which the
privy councillors had occupied in the sixteenth century to be weakened
by their paucity and slight influence. During this parliament there were
only two or three councillors in the commons, and none of them ever
acquired any real leadership in debate. The absence of such leadership
as the Elizabethan councillors had supplied, naturally led back-bcnchers
to accept guidance from private members. Although Sir Edwin Sandys
cannot be regarded as the leader of the opposition, in any modem sense
of that term, the feebleness of the court representatives gave him an
opportunity which he skilfully utilized to concentrate the attention of
the house upon such grievances as purveyance or impositions. In addition
members found a way to free themselves from the control which privy
councillors had exercised over committees, by enlarging them so that
they became committees of the whole house. This change in procedure grew
more and more important in the twenties and was admirably suited to
training and developing leaders in the struggle against the court. Thus
the tide was already advancing strongly in resistance to that system of
monarchy which James loved so well. His complete failure to appraise
the new spirit that was animating members, and his entire lack of
sympathy with popular opinion, were plainly revealed after the
dissolution of his first parliament, in which criticism of his beloved
Scots had been frequent. He now scattered £34,000 among his favourites
stly fellow countrymen, and created Robert Carr Viscount Rochester,
thereby for the first time enabling a Scot to sit in the house of lords.


Salisbury, who was mainly responsible for the royal policy, did not long
survive the first parliament of the reign; and his death in 1612 removed
a powerful restraint, for hitherto James had been kept from serious
errors by the awe his minister inspired in him. Almost at once a change
is noticeable, and a more frivolous tone perceptible. For the next nine
years the domestic history of England largely consists of the annals of
the court, where the most important events were the fall of one
favourite and his supersession by another. The king seems to have felt
that he had been unduly overshadowed by Salisbury, who had engrossed the
two offices of lord treasurer and secretary of state. Accordingly the
treasury was put into commission and the king was his own secretary of
state for nearly two years, until the appointment of Sir Ralph Winwood.
Both arrangements worked badly, for the treasury steadily increased its
indebtedness and the king was much too indolent to transact the business
of an office that required daily attention. He came to rely more and
more upon Rochester, whom he hoped to fashion into a useful instrument
to carry out the royal policy, but was himself moulded to the wishes of
the favourite, and thus became involvrd volved in an infamous tragedy.
Rochester was enamoured of Frances ( Howard), wife of the earl of Essex,
and daughter of the earl of Suffolk and great-niece of the earl of
Northampton, the leaders of the pro-Spanish faction in England. James
was so infatuated with Rochesterz that he must be held responsible for
the success of the suit for nullity which the countess brought, inasmuch
as he appointed new members, carefully chosen, to a .Commission that was
evenly divided. To the great scandal of honest men, Lady Essex was thus
enabled to marry her paramour. One result of this unhallowed union
between a daughter of the Howard family and the special friend of the
king was the triumph of the Spanish faction at the court. Their
influence over the king was much strengthened after the dissolution of
the Addled Parliament.

The elections to this parliament 1684 created unusual excitement owing
to the activities of some self-appointed ‘undertakers’ who hoped to
secure the return of members likely to support the court. The extent of
their interference was much exaggerated by rumour, and this in itself
sufficed to secure their defeat. James made two speeches, early in the
parliament, in which he acknowledged that there was a great increase of
popery; this he attributed to the impunity the papists enjoyed in
consequence of the failure of the proper officers to make presentments
against them. He was careful to add that no religion or heresy had ever
been extirpated by violence. He confessed his need of parliamentary
grants and blamed his heavy family expenses,–the burial of his son Henry
and the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth whom he had sacrificed in the
interest of religion and the commonwealth. He denounced as utterly false
the reports that he had relied upon the undertakers, and denied that he
had aided or hindered any man at the election. As for grievances, let
each member present those of his own constituency, but let them not be
heaped together in a scroll which would cast aspersions upon his
government and evince discontent rather than desire for reformation.

Speedy disillusion awaited James’s hope that the commons would revert to
the earliest stages of parliament, when individual petitions were
presented. Instead prompt consideration was given to a bill against
impositions–a vexed question left over from the last parliament. In
their desire for support the commons appealed to the lords, but their
co-operation was denied in a close division in which the majority was
largely composed of bishops, courtiers, and the two Scots who had been
created English peers. To make matters worse, Neile, bishop of Lincoln
and one of the worst of sycophants, who was possibly angered by a speech
in the commons charging the clergy with leading scandalous lives,
delivered a strong attack upon the commons. Let not the lords enter into
a conference, he said, on a bill that struck at the very root of the
prerogative. They would be sure to hear undutiful and seditious
speeches, tending to distract both houses and alienate the king and his
subjects. When the commons complained of this speech Neile apologized
with tears, but the commons were stir unsatisfied. Not content with
debating the bishop’s speech against them in the upper house, they
strayed like lost sheep into all kinds of trifling accusations
concerning his conduct in his diocese. When they were sharply pulled up
by the king, angry complaints were made about the royal favourites and
pensioners. The result was a dissolution. James gave his version of the
trouble to the Spanish ambassador, Sarmiento:

The house of commons is a body without a head. The members give their
opinions in a disorderly manner. At their meetings nothing is heard but
cries, shouts and confusion. I am surprised that my ancestors should
ever have permitted such an institution to come into existence. I am a
stranger, and found it here when I arrived, so that I am obliged to put
up with what I cannot get rid of.

The need for money, which had been responsible for calling a parliament,
survived its dissolution. To raise funds James issued a general appeal
for a benevolence. This began with genuinely free gifts, offered to the
king by courtiers and others, and for a time retained its original
character; but it soon became apparent that the example of generosity
would not be generally followed. Thereupon the privy council attempted
to use the sheriffs and justices of the peace as its local agents. These
latter were instructed to inform people of means, within their
respective counties, that free gifts to His Majesty would be regarded as
proofs of good affections and held in grateful remembrance. What
happened in Devonshire is typical of the whole country. There the
justices informed the privy council of their anxiety that posterity
would suffer if they established such a precedent. ‘Nothing but the fear
of the just blame of after ages’ impelled them to refuse what they would
always be willing to give in accordance with the ancient and lawful
customs of the kingdom. At this juncture they were summoned before the
council, where it was proved that free gifts without coercion had often
been made to the king’s progenitors. Nevertheless, in spite of these
appeals, the amount raised from the whole country was only
about,£40,000, plus £20,000from the City and courtiers.

Meanwhile Rochester’s pre-eminence at court was being threatened by the
appearance there of George Villiers, the son of a Leicestershire knight,
first introduced to the king in 1614 and appointed a gentleman of the
bedchamber and knighted in April of the next year. The good looks and
facile manners of the young man alarmed Rochester, and he upbraided the
king bitterly. The royal apologia is one of the most curious documents
in English history. The king confesses that the favourite had ‘deserved
more trust and confidence of me than ever man did,-in secrecy above all
flesh, in feeling and impartial respect, as well to my honour in every
degree as to my profit’. Yet these merits have recently been ‘mixed with
strange streams of unquietness, passion, fury, and insolent pride, and
(which is worst of all) with a settled kind of induced obstinacy’. The
favourite’s sharp and bitter railing made Peacham’s treatise, a gentle
admonition in comparison, and seemed intended to persuade the writer
that he was to be overawed rather than loved. This discourse proceeded
from the infinite grief of a deeply wounded heart, which had suffered as
much as it could endure. The king continues:

Neither can I bear it longer without admitting an unpardonable sin
against God in consuming myself wilfully, and not only myself, but in
perilling thereby not only the good estate of mine own people, but even
the state of religion through all Christendom, which almost wholly,
under God, rests now upon my shoulders. Be not the occasion of the
hastening of his death through grief, who was not only your creator
under God, but hath many a time prayed for you, which I never did for
any subject alive but for you. . . . Hold me thus by the heart; you may
build upon my favour as upon a rock that never shall fail you. [Reward
me with your love and obedience for] it hath ever been my common answer
to any, that would plead for favour to a puritan minister by reason of
his rare gifts, that I had rather have a conformable man with but
ordinary parts, than the rarest men in the world, that will not be
obedient.’

Rochester’s downfall, however, came about not from sullen rudeness to
the king but from the discovery of a shocking crime. When Rochester
first became involved in a liaison with Lady Essex, he had not
infrequently profited by the superior intelligence of Sir Thomas
Overbury, an early friend. But when the annulment permitted Rochester to
regularize his relations with his paramour, Ovcrbury did his utmost to
dissuade him from marrying her. To get this inconvenient mentor out of
the way, James was induced to offer Overbury a diplomatic appointment,
and, when that was refused, to confine the unfortunate knight in the
Tower. This punishment failed to satisfy the bitter hatred of the
countess, even when she had attained her ambition and become the wife of
Rochester. After a number of failures Overbury was successfully
poisoned. The crime was not unearthed for two years, but in spite of the
lapse of time ample evidence was forthcoming to convict the countess.
The earl was found guilty too, but it is by no means certain that he was
an active participant in the crime. Both were pardoned, but the clemency
encouraged a suspicion that the king had connived at the murder. This
was grossly unjust, but James’s infatuation for Rochester, and the
active part he had taken in Lady Essex’s case, justified the general
disgust at the revelation of the character of one whom the king had
delighted to honour. Probably no single event, prior to the attempt to
arrest the five members in 1642, did more to lessen the general
reverence with which royalty was regarded in England than this unsavoury
episode.

Another event that gave public opinion a profound shock was the fall of
Sir Edward Coke. For ten years he had been the champion of the common
law against the prerogative. He had maintained that the prerogative was
subject to definite legal limitations, and that the judges should see
that it did not exceed them. In opposition to Coke’s views, legalists
like Bacon tended to magnify the prerogative until it seemed to be
supreme in the state, and to regard upholding the royal power as the
special duty of the judges. just as parliament had attacked what they at
least regarded as the unconstitutional proceedings of the Crown in the
matter of taxation, so Coke and the common lawyers tried to restrain
within due bounds the prerogative courts, such as the high commission.
Ever since his appointment in i 6o6 as chiefjustice of the court of
common pleas, Coke had been a thorn in the flesh of churchmen on account
of the writs of prohibition he had issued against the court of high
commission. Similarly, in the famous case of proclamations, he had laid
it down once for all that the king could not by proclamation change the
common law or create any new offences, although he admitted that if the
king prohibited by proclamation what was already punishable by law
future offenders would be guilty of an aggravated offence. To silence
this troublesome critic, James removed him from the court of common
pleas and made him chief justice of the king’s bench, but the promotion
did not achieve its purpose. Coke continued to assert the independence
of the judicature, and in Peacham’s case expressed the opinion that
judges should not be consulted individually and privately about a case
already pending, although for the present he did not protest against
their consultation in a body. The final quarrel between Coke and the
king took place over the question whether the king could command the
common-law courts to desist from hearing a case by issue of the writ de
non procedendo rege inconsulto. The judges made it clear that in their
view the king could not control cases pending, even if his interests
might be involved. Summoned before the council, the other judges
retreated, but Coke stood his ground and was dismissed from his office.
The lord chancellor told Coke’s successor that the dismissal was ‘a
lesson to be learned of all, and to be remembered and feared of all that
sit in judicial places’.

Although some further examples were necessary before all the judges were
prepared to accept the subservient position assigned to them by Stuart
theories of government, Coke’s disgrace was a heavy blow to the
independence of the judiciary. But his sacrifice of office rather than
conform to royal dictation was not in vain. Henceforth men became less
and less disposed to accept legal decisions as definitions of the
constitution, until in time even thoughtful men like Hyde felt that
the decision in Hampden’s case was against the plain and obvious meaning
of the law. By the dismissal of independent judges and the appointment
of subservient successors, the early Stuarts obtained servile
instruments. But the very means they took to secure favourable decisions
deprived those decisions of all moral weight.

During the years that intervened between the fall of Coke in 1616 and
the meeting of parliament in 1621, domestic history contributes little
worthy of remembrance, except the advance of Buckingham in royal favour
and the fall of the Howards. This amily, which engrossed many of the
offices of state, was headed by Nottingham, lord high admiral, and
Suffolk, lord high treasurer. Buckingham, whose pride could not endure
the presence at court of any who did not owe their advancement to his
influence, soon secured the exclusion of both from the administration.
Suffolk’s conviction of accepting bribes came none too soon, for the
financial position had steadily deteriorated under him. He was succeeded
at first by a commission and then by its moving spirit, Cranfield, who
had begun life as a London apprentice but who, after amassing a fortune
in the City, had quickly won favour at court and secured the
treasurership and the title of earl of Middlesex. Nottingham had to
resign after a commission had presented a hostile report on the state of
the navy. In this case, also, the change was all to the good, for
corruption and incompetence had long reigned supreme in the navy.
Although the annual cost of its upkeep was constantly rising, the number
of serviceable ships was little more than half the total inherited from
Elizabeth. James bragged that his choice fell not upon ‘an old beaten
soldier for my admiral’ but upon a young man whose honesty he trusted (
Buckingham), and there is no doubt that, thanks to the transformation of
the commission into a permanent navy board, the condition of affairs
vastly improved. Indeed it can be said that both at the treasury and at
the admiralty greater efficiency at less cost was secured by Buckingham
and his nominees than by their predecessors. Yet the price paid for
these reforms was too high, for Buckingham exacted servility from all,
and honest criticism and outspoken advice were no longer heard in
James’s court. Moreover the losses from the Howards’ corruption would
have been trifling compared with those sustained through Buckingham’s
overweening confidence in his capacity to rule England. And the time was
at hand when his ignorance of foreign affairs made free discussion in
the council essential.

The first stage of the Thirty Years War was now over, for the battle of
the White Mountain ( November 1620) ended Frederick’s brief reign in
Bohemia. It soon became evident, however, that his enemies would not
be content until they had also expelled him from the Upper and Lower
Palatinate. James, who had no direct responsibility for the rash
adventure in Bohemia, felt that he could not sit idly by while his
son-in-law was despoiled of his hereditary lands. Therefore, having
failed to induce his subjects to contribute liberally to a benevolence
to help Frederick, he once again had recourse to a parliament. The time
seemed opportune to profit by the warm sympathy Englishmen felt for
Frederick, popularly regarded as a protestant champion threatened with
destruction by a Roman catholic coalition. Probably never in previous
English history had interest in public affairs, and particularly in
foreign policy, been so intense. Sermons were often devoted to the
danger to continental protestantism, and it is noteworthy that the
earliest English newsbooks were printed in Holland ( 1620-1) and dealt
with foreign intelligence. James, however, regarded this popular
absorption in foreign news with strong disapproval. It is wholly
characteristic that, when Bacon drafted a proclamation to explain to the
electorate the situation of foreign affairs, which necessitated a
parliament, James’s comment was that, as the people were incapable of
understanding state affairs, it was not fit that the king should explain
them. He found it easy to punish ministers who talked politics in the
pulpit, and to issue a proclamation against the excessive discussion of
questions of state; but the mass of Englishmen were too interested to
be deterred. It is probable that, as Bacon suggested, the disappointing
results of the elections were occasioned by recent events on the
Continent and ‘the general licentious speaking of state matters’.
factor he overlooked was the depression lasting from about 1619 to 1624.
Hard times are usually blamed on the government by electors and there is
no reason to believe 1621 was an exception.

James’s contempt for the opinions of the man in the street and his
determination to exclude members of parliament from all real influence
upon the direction of foreign affairs were fatal to his relations with
the legislature. He would need money to carry on whatever foreign policy
he judged best, but parliament would refuse grants unless it both knew
and approved the policy that required the expenditure. At present James
was in a curious position because parliament accepted one half of his
foreign policy, his anxiety to prevent the catholic powers from
overrunning the Palatinate, but disliked the other half, the Spanish
match. It is just possible that, had the king given a strong lead in
his opening speech to parliament ( January 1621), domestic grievances
would have been forgotten amid the excitement of a spirited attempt to
preserve Frederick in his hereditary domains. Instead James disdained to
take parliament into his confidence, and his remarks were singularly ill
suited to enlist the sympathies of his hearers. ‘But you of the Lower
House,’ he said, ‘I would not have you to meddle with complaints against
the King, the church or state matters, nor with princes’ prerogatives.’
2 On the all-engrossing question of foreign policy, he merely said that
he would never suffer the Spanish match to endanger religion and that he
proposed to equip an army in the summer to preserve his children’s
patrimony, and for this reason supplies would be needed. No hint was
afforded of the probable cost of the army or of the extent of his
commitments with foreign powers. Accordingly parliament made the rather
perfunctory grant of two subsidies, and then turned to redress of
grievances.

For some time there had been indications of the storm about to break,
because a writer of newsletters had noted that everybody was groaning
under the burden of monopolies, whose number had been multiplied by a
score since James’s accession. What made this burden the more
unbearable was that Elizabeth’s gracious surrender in 1601 had seemed to
lighten it permanently, for she had agreed that the legality or
otherwise of any or every patent might be tested in the law-courts. At
the very beginning of the new reign the judges in the famous case, Darcy
v. Allen, had delivered the unanimous decision that a monopoly was prima
facie against both common and statute law, that it was burdensome to the
kingdom because it raised the price of the commodity at the same time
that it lowered the quality and threw artificers out of work, and that
it was justifiable only when a new invention was made or introduced or
when demanded in the interest of the state. Nevertheless the law had
been ignored, evaded, or broken. In 1606, 1610, and 1614 parliament had
protested against the abuse of patents, but the evil was more rampant
than ever during the early years of Buckingham’s ascendancy. Then the
relatives or dependants of the favourite enjoyed three monopolies–for
the licensing of inns, and that of ale-houses, and for the manufacturing
of gold and silver thread. No doubt these monopolies furnished pickings
for their possessors, but the gain was small in comparison with the
irritation caused. The country gentleman who was a magistrate was
affronted at the implication that he was incapable of supervising the
inns in his neighbourhood, the puritan protested that the new patentees
licensed disorderly houses and multiplied drinking facilities far beyond
the reasonable needs of the people, and the City mercers were annoyed at
the privileged position given to a rival industry.

As soon as the commons began to discuss grievances, the proceedings of
the monopolists came in for severe censure. In particular Sir Francis
Mitchell and Sir Giles Mompesson were found to have been extortionate as
licensers of inns, and the tale of their iniquities aroused the house to
a fury. Mitchell was called to the bar and sentenced without a hearing.
2 Then, rather late in the day, the question was raised whether the
commons had any right to punish offences which did not concern their
privileges. A search for precedents having failed, it was resolved to
repair to the lords. The king, hearing of these proceedings,
unexpectedly addressed the lords in a curiously vacillating speech
intended to exempt himself and Buckingham (and his relatives) from all
blame. He told the lords that the commons would be the accusers and they
the judges, and that they must be careful to see that all charges
against Mompesson were proved by witnesses. The speech ended
characteristically with the pronouncement that ‘I will give accoumpt to
God and to my people declaratively, and he that will have all doon by
parliament is an enemy to monarchie and a traitor to the king of
England’. Undeterred, the lords heard witnesses and passed sentence.
Now, having tasted blood, the commons flew at higher game. During their
investigations of irregularities at the courts of law they unearthed
evidence that Francis Bacon, Viscount St. Albans, lord high chancellor
of England, had accepted presents from suitors, a few while their suits
were actually pending but usually after judgement had been delivered.
Bacon at once realized the uselessness of attempting a defence to the
articles of impeachment exhibited against him, and acknowledged the
substantial accuracy of the charges. The king remitted most of the
penalties imposed, but excluded him from all public business. He did not
long survive his disgrace, dying in 1626. The only possible line of
defence is that which he himself suggested in a letter written to the
king at an early stage of the proceedings. ‘I hope I shall not be
found’, he said, ‘to have the troubled fountain of a corrupt heart in a
depraved habit of taking rewards to pervert justice; howsoever I may be
frail and partake of the abuse of the times.’ The most lenient view
that can be taken, therefore, is that the highest legal dignitary in the
kingdom accepted presents from suitors, when he must have known full
well that these presents were either given in the hope of influencing
decisions or in gratitude for favourable decisions. Whether the
distinction between accepting presents under these circumstances and
taking bribes is worth making, is a question that can be left to the
casuist.

These judicial proceedings, and the time they consumed, seem to have
alarmed and irritated the court. When the houses met, after an
adjournment, members were told to avoid long speeches and malicious
diversions from what should be the sole business before them, the grant
of supplies to sustain the army in the Palatinate. Once again the
commons were left without any clear indication of the nature of the
policy they were asked to finance. They naturally demanded that, first,
they should know against what enemy the army to be raised was going to
march. After voting a subsidy for the immediate support of the forces in
the Palatinate, the commons drew up a petition in which they sketched
the European situation as they saw it.

They represented what they conceived to be the causes of the unhappy
state of affairs, and what the remedies. Briefly the causes were the
Roman catholic league abroad, with the king of Spain at its head, and
the connexion between the triumph of popery on the Continent and its
increase at home. The remedies were to declare war against the head of
the catholic league and to marry the prince of Wales to a protestant.
Before this petition was formally presented, James, egged on by
Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, wrote to the Speaker. Hearing that
‘some fiery and popular spirits’ were debating questions far above their
reach and tending to violate the royal prerogative, the king demanded
that no one in the house should henceforth presume to meddle ‘with
anything concerning our government or matters of state’, and
particularly not with the Spanish match. Furthermore the king said that
he felt himself ‘very free and able to punish any man’s misdemeanors in
parliament, as well during their sitting as after. Which we mean not to
spare hereafter upon any occasion of any man’s insolent behaviour
there.’

The commons then drew up an explanation of their petition, in which they
acknowledged that to make peace and war and to marry the prince of Wales
appertained solely to the royal prerogative. The reason for their
petition, therefore, was merely to bring to the king’s attention certain
facts which might not otherwise come to his knowledge, and they now
asked him to receive their answer and petition. This explanation was not
unnaturally roughly handled by the king, who pointed out that it was
idle to protest at one place that they did not intend to entrench upon
the prerogative and yet in reality to usurp it by their advice.
Thereupon the commons drafted the famous Protestation of 18 December
1621, in which they denied, by implication, the king’s claim to the
right to imprison members at his will, by asserting that their lives and
privileges were ‘the ancient and undoubted birthright and inheritance of
the subjects of England’. They replied to the king’s denial of their
right to discuss foreign relations with the statement that what
concerned the king, state, defence of the realm, and the church of
England were proper subjects for counsel and debate in parliament and
that they had every right to discuss and resolve them.

This was too much for James’s patience, and he first adjourned and then
dissolved parliament. Coke and Sir Robert Phelips were imprisoned, and
Pym confined to his house, for their share in the proceedings. Further
to mark his disapprobation, the king ordered the production of the
journal of the commons, at a meeting of the privy council, and tore out
the offending protestation. At the same time he made a speech condemning
it because it was framed in ambiguous and general terms that might serve
in the future as precedents for the invasion of most of the prerogatives
of the Crown. The criticism is just. The commons’ right to give advice
on all subjects was substantially new, and if conceded would give them
simultaneously an indirect control over the administration, for they
would naturally refuse supplies whenever their advice was not accepted.
James realized the logical consequences of their claims more clearly
than they did themselves, but he entirely failed to gauge the strength
of popular support the commons had at their backs and particularly
failed to perceive that his pursuance of a proSpanish foreign policy was
the surest way to alienate the sympathy of the middle classes, so
strongly represented in parliament.

Bad as the mistake was in choosing friendship with Spain, and the
Spanish match, as subjects for rebutting the pretensions of the commons,
James gave his case away by the grossest inconsistency. After the
failure of the long-drawn-out negotiations with Spain, he summoned
parliament and virtually handed over the direction of foreign relations
to the very body he had so recently rebuked. In his opening speech (
February 1624) he said that full particulars of the negotiations would
be given members. When they had heard about the negotiations, ‘I shall
then entreat your good and sound advice. . . . Never a king gave more
trust to his subjects than to desire their advice in matters of this
weight.’ Later he said that no man dying of thirst longed for water more
ardently than he desired a happy conclusion to his parliament. On the
whole his wish was gratified, and he parted on better terms with the
houses, now, than on any previous occasion, for king and subjects were
united against Spain–although the union was achieved only after the
complete failure of a policy pursued consistently for a decade.
Moreover, judging by the course of events, the king’s statecraft had
been wrong and popular prejudice right. It was perhaps fortunate for his
peace of mind that he died at the outbreak of hostilities, for his reign
ended, as it had begun, with England at war with Spain.

Miserably as James had failed in his most cherished plan, he furnished
proof before he died that he was wiser than his son and his favourite.
When they insisted on promoting the impeachment of the treasurer,
Middlesex, the king warned Charles that he would live to have his fill
of impeachments, and Buckingham, that he was merely pickling a rod for
his own back. Perhaps the king realized that the proceedings against
Middlesex were more significant constitutionally than those against
Mompesson or Bacon. Then the commons had been content to turn over the
evidence to the lords for investigation and punishment; now they
presented definite charges as ‘inquisitors general of the grievances of
the kingdom’.

Constitutionally the reign is the first of six that occupied the
transitional period during which the Tudor monarchy was transformed into
the Hanoverian. It is difficult, therefore, to gauge the advance made by
parliament under James. That the two houses would no longer be content
to occupy a subordinate position in the state was already clear. When
not blinded by anger, the king was too shrewd not to see that a new
power had arisen in the land, as was proved by his famous remark, on
receiving a parliamentary deputation: ‘Chairs for the ambassadors.’ Yet
the only privilege the house of commons asserted so decidedly that it
was never called in question was the right to determine the validity of
the election of its own members. Neither immunity from arrest for words
spoken in parliament, nor the right to tender advice freely on all
subjects, was acknowledged by the Crown, and both privileges were
infringed by Charles I. During his last years James ceded the revived
claim to call ministers to account by impeachment, but Charles utterly
denied it in order to save Buckingham.

The future seemed to depend on two factors–how far the needs of the
Crown could be supplied by its ordinary revenue, and whether the commons
could count on the support of the

lords. James had been successful in establishing impositions as regular
levies on merchandise, but his efforts to raise money by benevolences or
forced loans had been foiled by the passive resistance of his subjects.
At the end of his reign the Crown could rely upon funds nearly
sufficient to meet ordinary expenses but would be forced to ask
parliamentary grants for emergencies. In other words a peaceful policy
would virtually obviate the necessity of calling parliament, but a war
would compel recourse to one. The question of the co-operation of the
two houses was still open, half-way through the reign. At its
commencement the lords refused to join the commons in attempting to
suppress the evils of purveyance, and in 1614 adopted the same attitude
with regard to impositions. Yet during the last few years signs were not
lacking that the two houses would present a united front. James’s lavish
creation of English peerages and bestowal of Scottish and Irish
peerages on Englishmen, the ascendancy of Buckingham in the royal
counsels, and later the influence ecclesiastics exercised in politics,
all combined to alienate the old nobility and to produce an opposition
party-‘the country lords’, as its members were called in
contradistinction to the court lords and the bishops. As generally
happens, personal wrongs coincided with public grievances in estranging
the lords from the court. No doubt the lords resented their exclusion
from the royal confidence unless they deferred to Buckingham, but they
were also disgusted at the national disasters for which he was
responsible. Consequently they viewed with equanimity, or even
encouraged, the growing pretensions of the commons.

The declension of the influence on public affairs of those who prided
themselves on being the natural-born counsellors of the king was not due
solely to the early Stuarts and their idiosyncrasies. The time had come
when the enlargement of the sphere of governmental activity required
more elaborate administrative machinery than had previously sufficed.
During Elizabeth’s reign, even the tireless energy and business acumen
of Burghley and Walsingham, with the assistance of a small group of
councillors, could scarcely keep pace with the daily routine of the
government. After the death of Salisbury in 1612 his successors had
neither the ability nor, for the most part, the devotion to duty that
had inspired the Elizabethan ministers of state. It is not surprising,
therefore, that the group of privy councillors that served Elizabeth was
only half as large as that under James. The privy council now contained
the chief officers of state and of the household, and such personages,
English and Scottish, as the king thought fit to honour. By the end of
his reign there were about thirty-five privy councillors, a number which
was increased to about forty by 1630 but restored by 1640. The increase
in size did not make for greater efficiency, and the non-official
members rarely gave constant attendance. Consequently recourse was had
to committees, some temporary, some permanent. The standing committees
of James’s reign were numerous and gave preliminary consideration to
matters concerning Ireland, the navy, &c. Most important of them was
that for foreign affairs, for this was the direct ancestor of the
cabinet. Apparently it began with the appointment of a committee in or
about 1615 to treat of the Spanish marriage. By the end of James’s reign
it was already discussing questions of state in no way directly
concerned with foreign affairs and had achieved sufficient importance to
be referred to as the junta, or cabinet council. Charles I continued the
practice of his father, and it was in the cabinet council that Strafford
spoke the words that brought him to the block. However, although by
1640 the cabinet council had become established in fact and was legally
what it has always remained, a committee of the privy council, it bore
little resemblance to the modern cabinet. Above all, its members were
not selected from among the leaders in parliament, and it contributed
nothing to bridge the gulf that was rapidly widening between king and
parliament. Indeed in the absence of well-defined political parties in
parliament it would have been difficult to make the seventeenth-century
cabinet a means to create harmony between legislature and executive.

Looking both backwards and forwards, there is no doubt that the
relations of the early Stuarts with their parliaments were vitiated
throughout by their firm belief in the theory of the divine right of
kings. Englishmen had ample opportunity of learning what James thought
about monarchy. In 1598 he published his Trew Law of Free Monarchies. In
1616 The Workesof the Most High and Mighty Prince, James of the Most
High and Mighty Prince, James were collected and published. In addition
the king rarely lost an opportunity of setting forth his theories in
speeches. In so doing he was not actuated solely by a vain desire to
display his learning but had the deliberate intention, as he said, to
set cor regis in oculis populi and to act as the ‘great schoolmaster of
the whole land’. From his utterances and writings, therefore, it is
possible to deduce his conception of the royal office with greater
definition than for any other English king. By a free monarch he meant
one free from all control. Even though ‘a free and absolute monarch’
owed duties to his subjects and was ordained for their advantage, no
degree of tyranny on his part justified them in resisting. He could
make laws without the co-operation of parliament or suspend laws passed
by parliament, and, notwithstanding that ‘a good king will frame all his
actions according to the law, yet he is not bound thereto but of his own
good will’. The state of monarchy was the supremest thing on earth,
because kings are not only God’s lieutenants here below and sit upon
God’s thrones, but even by God himself are called gods. Therefore, as it
is blasphemy to dispute what God can do, and as good Christians content
themselves with his will revealed in his word, so it is presumption and
high contempt in a subject to dispute what a king can do, and a good
subject cheerfully abides by the king’s pleasure revealed in his law.

James was far from successful in persuading the masses of his subjects
to accept these views. The school of divines which contemporaries came
to style ‘Arminian’, but which modern writers often call ‘Laudian’,
wholeheartedly adopted them and preached them fervently. Among laymen,
however, there were few imitators of these clerics. In particular
parliament, which formed the audience for many of the king’s utterances,
remained wholly unconvinced. A well-informed observer, writing, in 1610,
after one of the more hyperbolical of the king’s speeches, noted of it:
‘I hear it bred generally much discomfort, to see our monarchicall power
and regal prerogative strained so high, and made so transcendent every
way, that yf the practise should follow the positions, we are not likely
to leave to our successors that freedome we received from our
forefathers.’ Thus the persistence with which James thrust down his
subjects’ throats his theory of the constitution almost compelled them
in their turn to formulate their views of the limitations of monarchy
and the rights of parliament, which might otherwise have remained
undefined for a generation longer. James had called into existence,
therefore, an opposition that in less than twenty years advanced from
the modest position of the Apology of 1604 to the bold stand of the
Protestation of 1621. These contradictory theories of the respective
powers of king and parliament contained material for a bitter conflict,
but James was by temperament adverse to pushing matters to extremes and
too indolent to pursue any path persistently. Hence the day of the
constitutional battle was postponed to the next reign.

Charles I never attempted elaborately to define his conception of
kingship. He did not share his father’s fondness for abstract
speculation or his considerable literary and oratorical gifts. His views
have to be gleaned, therefore, from occasional utterances, not from
full-length discourses. Nevertheless he stated, time after time, one
postulate of the theory of the divine right of kings. ‘I must avow’, he
said in June 1628, ‘that I owe the account of my actions to God alone.’
While on trial for his life he was equally definite. ‘A king’, he told
Bradshaw, the president of the court, ‘cannot be tried by any superior
jurisdiction on earth.’ But for Bradshaw’s interruption, he would have
continued that the Scripture saith, ‘Where the word of a king is,
there is power, and who may say unto him “What doest thou?”’ He cited
the legal maxim that a king can do no wrong as proof that he could not
be impeached. He was equally convinced that there was a divine law
commanding subjects to obey their king, under penalty of God’s
judgement. At the time of the negotiations at Uxbridge, in February
1645, he suggested to Sir Edward Nicholas, then secretary of state, that
if, during his arguments with the parliamentary commissioners, ‘in your
privat discourses, . . . you would put them in mynde that they were
arrant rebelles & that their end must be damnation, ruine, and infamy,
except they repented, . . . it might doe good’. He remained consistent
to the last hour of his life. From the scaffold he declared that the
people had no claim to any voice in the government. Their freedom
consisted in the enjoyment of laws by which their life and liberty would
be secure. It was not in having a share in the government: that did not
pertain to them –‘a subject and a soveraign are clean different things’.


Both James and his son were thus devoted adherents of the theory of the
divine right of kings, though they stressed different postulates. The
father, however, was usually content to be logical and consistent on
paper, whereas the son was consistent in trying to translate his
theories into action. Charles had been a very sickly child, not expected
to survive. He was very slow in beginning to walk and to talk, but
whereas he became a good horseman and walker, he suffered from an
impediment in his speech all his life. This defect may account for the
gravity and reserve which caused his elder brother, Henry (d. 1612), to
tease him by calling him the archbishop of York. Unlike his father’s,
his disposition was inflexible. His intellect was rigid, yet he was
capable of quibbling and giving evasive answers that might mislead. He
himself said that he could never be a lawyer: ‘I cannot defend the bad
nor yield in a good cause.’

Charles’s character augured ill for the future, inasmuch as both the
general trend of events–the spirit of the age–and the particular
circumstances in which the new reign opened called for conciliation in
order to win support for the expensive policy now being pursued abroad.

When Charles succeeded James in 1625, he found that the financial needs
of the Crown compelled the prompt summoning of parliament. When it met
the king and those who spoke in his name did little more than assert
that, as the previous parliament had advised the present policy, the
present one would no doubt provide the necessary funds. There was from
the start, however, a disinclination among members to recognize in the
extravagant schemes now on foot the true offspring of their
predecessors. They voted two subsidies, or about one-seventh of the
amount the king needed, and then began to discuss the state of affairs,
particularly the way in which the previous grants had been spent.
Different speakers stressed different points: that no one seemed to be
any the better for the expenditure; that the king would do well to
follow Queen Elizabeth’s example and rely upon a grave and wise council
rather than upon one or two favourites; that the journey to Madrid was
the real cause of the war with Spain, not any parliamentary action; that
it was well known that then articles that benefited Roman catholics had
been sanctioned, and it might be that the recent marriage treaty with
France included similar provisions; and that, after all, the best way to
secure national safety was to suppress Roman catholicism at home. In
vain Buckingham took upon himself the fence of the royal policy and
urged prompt grant of supplies. The commons by this time had made up
their mind that redress of grievances must have precedence. Voices were
even heard hinting that the favourite was the greatest grievance of all.
Charles thereupon hurriedly dissolved his first parliament, and thus
terminated the opening scene in the long tragedy that ended twenty-four
years later upon the scaffold.

His position continued to grow worse, for the expedition to Cadiz
returned in disgrace and the tension between the English and French
courts was increasing so rapidly as to threaten war. The attempt to
raise money by the issue of privy seals asking individuals to lend
specific sums of money failed so completely that it was plainly
necessary to summon another parliament. Charles did his best to smooth
his path by ordering strict enforcement of the penal laws against
papists, by appointing as sheriffs the leaders of the opposition in the
late parliament, and by appointing Laud to preach to the two houses when
they assembled. His sermon is a remarkable exposition of the views, on
the unity of church and state, that prevailed at court. It was declared
that a royal command must be God’s glory, and obedience to it the
subject’s honour. It was asserted that the king would never depart from
God’s service, from the care of his people, or from the wise managing of
his treasure. Laud’s biographer remarks that this was sound doctrine but
was not acceptable to the auditors. Soon they were listening to an
orator of very different type–Eliot–on the late disasters. He roundly
declared: ‘Our honour is ruined, our ships are sunk, our men perished;
not by the sword, not by the enemy, not by chance, but, as the strongest
predictions had discerned and made it appear beforehand, by those we
trust.’ His speech really determined the history of this parliament,
for it convinced members that a strict accountability for the past must
precede any provision for the future. The commons soon found that in
their endeavour to establish the responsibility for Mansfeld’s
disastrous expedition they were hampered by the refusal of the council
of war to testify as to the opinions of individual members. Charles
upheld them in their refusal: ‘It is not you that they aim at, but it is
me upon whom they make inquisition, and for subsidies, they will not
hinder it. Gold may be bought too dear.’ Undaunted, the commons now
attacked Buckingham as the author of all the national ills, and, once
fairly started after their prey, they could not be called off. On one
occasion Charles warned them not to question the man whom he delighted
to honour and whom he cherished so dearly. A second time he threatened
them in unmistakable terms: ‘Remember that parliaments are altogether in
my power for their calling, sitting, and dissolution; therefore, as I
find the fruits good or evil, they are to continue, or not to be.’

Perhaps the commons were emboldened by the knowledge that they could
count on the support of the peers, for the upper house had revealed an
independent spirit from the start of the session. They began by
resolving that no peer should hold more than two proxies, thus striking
a shrewd blow at Buckingham, who had thirteen. They presented three
successive petitions to the king for the release of Arundel, nominally
confined for an offence personal to Charles but in reality for
opposition to Buckingham. The king did not give way until there was a
probability that they would refuse to transact any business in Arundel’s
absence. When Charles attempted, by having Bristol accused of high
treason, to prevent his revealing what had actually happened at Madrid
during the visit there of the prince and Buckingham, the house
simultaneously accepted Bristol’s charge of high treason against
Buckingham. They foiled all the king’s efforts to deprive Bristol of a
fair trial and allowed the earl to put in an answer full of damaging
revelations. It was therefore clear, when the commons in their turn drew
up an impeachment of Buckingham, that nothing could save him but the
dissolution of parliament. When the lords prayed the king that they
might sit a little longer, his reply, ‘not a minute’, showed that he
realized the peril in which his favourite stood.

The need for money remained as pressing after the dissolution of
parliament as before. A demand for a free gift, equal in amount to the
subsidies proposed but not voted by parliament, was dispatched to the
justices of the peace, whose panels were purged of the names of all
those obnoxious to the court. The response, however, was extremely
meagre, for men refused to give except in a parliamentary way. A very
rickety fleet was collected from the maritime towns and counties, and
those who objected were sharply told that in times of danger ordinary
precedents no longer applied. There was still no money, however, to
feed or pay mariners, although the probability of a war with France made
the equipment of the fleet more imperative than ever. Therefore the king
had recourse to a forced loan, to be raised by commissioners who were to
exact from all men rated in the subsidy-books sums equivalent to what
they would have paid if parliament had voted five subsidies. To make the
scheme more palatable, Charles called upon the clergy for help from
their pulpits. In a letter to the archbishop–doubtless intended to serve
as a text for many a sermon–the king urged that, having been led into
war by the advice of parliament, he could not now be abandoned but with
the sin and shame of all men. The section of the clergy that good
protestants were beginning to label ‘Arminian’ willingly responded to
the call. Sibthorpe and Roger Manwaring preached sermons magnifying the
prerogative above law and parliament. Charles was so pleased with the
former’s effusion that he directed the archbishop to license it. The
archbishop refused. Thereupon he was ordered to confine himself to his
house and was supplanted in the church courts by a commission headed by
Laud. Other methods than persuasion were adopted in dealing with those
who refused to contribute. By way of warning, the lord chief justice,
Sir Randolph Crew, was dismissed for refusing to acknowledge the
legality of the loan. Some of the recalcitrants were sent to prison, or
into confinement, or to serve on board ship, and an attempt was even
made to compel fifty men from Essex to accept press-money for service
with the king of Denmark. Among those who refused to contribute were
Eliot, destined to be a martyr for parliamentary liberties, Hampden, the
future hero of the struggle against ship-money, and Wentworth, who,
after changing sides, became the great exponent of personal government.

During the year 1627 the situation went from bad to worse. The king of
Denmark was expelled from Germany, and the protestant cause lay at the
feet of the victorious Roman catholics; the French Huguenots were
encouraged to rebel, but Buckingham suffered a decisive defeat on the
Isle of Ré when he tried to relieve La Rochelle. These disasters
increased the need of money at the same time that they made borrowing
more difficult. As one of Buckingham’s parasites acknowledged, ‘No man
that is moneyed will lend upon any security, if they think it to go the
way of the court, which now is made diverse from the state.’ The
failure off La Rochelle was regarded as the greatest and most shameful
defeat England had suffered since the loss of Normandy. Indeed,
according to Denzil Holles, who was one of the five members whom Charles
tried to arrest in 1642, England had never received so dishonourable a
blow. Exasperation at the manifest misgovernment naturally
strengthened resistance to the forced loans, and before the end of the
year an attempt was made to test the legality of confinements for
refusing to contribute. In a famous case five prisoners applied for a
writ of habeas corpus in order to bring their case before the king’s
bench. The writ was not one of right but of grace, yet it was granted
because of the great public interest in the issue at stake. Probably the
five knights hoped that the question would be raised whether a refusal
to contribute to the loan was a legal cause for commitment. The return
to the writ, however, merely stated that they were committed by the
special command of the king, and assigned no other reason whatsoever.
Thereupon one of the prisoners, Darnel, refused to proceed, but the
other four contended that they should be released on bail, since they
had been committed without cause shown. The attorney-general argued that
they should be kept in prison until the king was ready to bring them to
trial. The precedents, as well as the statutes, were by no means clear,
and accordingly the decision of the judges was: ‘We cannot deliver you
but you must be remanded.’ The judges apparently intended to postpone
further consideration of the case because, as one stated later, there
was no record that, upon such a writ as the present one, a man had ever
been bailed without the king being first consulted, and the prisoners
might have sued out another habeas corpus the next day. Actually both
they and the general public assumed that a final verdict had been given
and that the judges had lent their authority to the view that the loan
and the imprisonments for refusing to contribute to it were legal, and
that the king had the right to commit for indefinite periods without his
victims’ having any redress at law.

The prison doors were opened at the beginning of 1628, but this clemency
did not evoke any gratitude in the country at large. When Charles caused
elections to be held for a third parliament, the main issues were the
forced loan and arbitrary punishment. Popular interest ran high and
considerable pressure was brought to bear in favour of court candidates,
but the royal influence was powerless against appeals on behalf of those
who had suffered imprisonment rather than contribute to the exchequer in
an unparliamentary way. An observer summed up the results of the
election as follows: ‘It is feared . . . because such patriots are
chosen every where, the parliament will not last above eight days.’
When the houses met, the debates turned almost exclusively upon the
question how to prevent extra-parliamentary taxation and imprisonment
without cause shown. The commons began by passing resolutions against
unparliamentary taxation, against the retention of any man in prison by
command of the king or council unless the cause were expressed, against
the denial of the writ of habeas corpus, and against the refusal to
release or bail a prisoner confined without cause shown. These
resolutions occasioned a great debate in the house of lords, where it
was thought by a contemporary that the majority stood ‘for the king’s
prerogative against the subject’s liberties’. Generally speaking, the
old nobility opposed the court, but the new creations and most of the
bishops favoured it. The parties were so evenly divided that in the end
a compromise was reached which attempted to prevent the king from
interfering with due process of law in normal times but would permit him
to override it in an emergency.

The commons, however, were unwilling to acknowledge explicitly that the
king possessed these extraordinary powers, especially as no satisfactory
form of words could be devised to define them. Abandoning their own
resolutions, they now determined to proceed by a bill which should both
reaffirm the validity of old statutes safeguarding the liberty of the
subject and interpret them in the sense the commons thought right.
Thereupon the king declared that, as he was willing to promise to
observe the old statutes, so his subjects should be content to contain
themselves within the laws of their forefathers, without enlarging them
by new explanations or additions. The flat refusal of the king to suffer
his prerogative to be curtailed by law prompted Sir Edward Coke to hit
upon the happy idea that the two houses should join in a Petition of
Right to the king for the redress of their particular grievances. Such
petitions had been used by individuals in the past, when they felt that
the sovereign or his servants had exercised his prerogative to override
the law, and merely sought permission for the petitioners to enjoy the
benefit of the law. The Petition of Right emanating from parliament,
however, was intended to go farther and to declare what the law was, as
well as to secure for individuals the benefit of it. The king was
deterred from a speedy dissolution only by his financial needs and by
the knowledge that the majority of the house of lords sided with his
opponents. In vain he attempted ambiguous and evasive answers to the
Petition, for both houses requested a clear and satisfactory answer, and
in the end the king assented in the style, Soit droit fait come est
desiré. The Petition, ‘concerning divers rights and liberties of the
subjects’, begins with a recital of the statutes alleged to have been
broken and of the grievances for which redress was now provided. It then
proceeds to ask: (1) that no man hereafter should be compelled to make
any gift, loan, benevolence, tax, or such like charge, without common
consent by act of parliament; (2) that no free man should be imprisoned
or detained without cause shown; (3) that soldiers and mariners should
not be billeted upon private individuals against their will; and (4)
that commissions for proceeding by martial law should not be issued in
the future.

Previous to the royal assent to the Petition, the commons had been
careful to consult the lords at every stage, and together the two houses
had prevailed. Thenceforth the commons rashly attempted to stand alone,
and made no effort to secure the co-operation of the upper house. After
the failure, under Wentworth’s leadership, to embody in a bill such a
compromise as would both satisfy the king and safeguard the liberty of
the subject, Eliot had recovered the ascendancy he had exercised over
the house in 1626. The greatest orator of his generation, he was fiery
and impulsive by nature, prone to idealize the commons at the expense of
king and lords, and scornful of the daily compromises so essential in
political life. Through his impatience he had hazarded the fruits of the
session by proposing remonstrances and attacking Buckingham, for only by
the action of the lords was the king dissuaded from a dissolution, and
only by their intervention was he induced to accept the Petition. The
necessity of conciliating the upper house proved irksome to Eliot’s
democratic ardour. On one occasion he had said, ‘I am confident that,
should the lords desert us, we should yet continue flourishing and
green’; and the commons proceeded, under his guidance, to test the
truth of this assertion. In particular they passed a remonstrance–a
prototype of the more famous measure of 1641–detailing grievances in
both church and state and naming their authors, Laud and Neile of the
first and Buckingham of the second. The lower house followed this up by
a second remonstrance, denouncing the collection of tonnage and poundage
as a breach of the fundamental liberties of the kingdom, because these
duties had never been granted to Charles I by parliament. The king
interrupted this hot pace by a prorogation. The speech that preceded it
contained a statement of his view of the Petition of Right: ‘The
profession of both houses, in time of hammering this Petition, was no
ways to intrench upon my prerogative, saying, they had neither intention
nor power to hurt it. Therefore it must needs be conceived that I have
granted no new, but only confirmed the ancient liberties of my
subjects.’ This view prevailed at law during the years prior to the
meeting of the long parliament. When those members who were imprisoned
after the dissolution in 1629 tried to take advantage of the Petition,
they were met by the attorney-general with the following argument:

A petition in parliament is not a law, yet it is for the honour and
dignity of the king, to observe and keep it faithfully; but it is the
duty of the people not to stretch it, beyond the words and intention of
the king. And no other construction can be made of the Petition, than to
take it as a confirmation of the antient liberties and rights of the
subject. So that now the case remains in the same quality and degree, as
it was before the Petition.

Thus its immediate effects were slight, and proof would be difficult to
find that the king’s government during the years 1629 to 1640 was
hampered by the Petition, except possibly with regard to forced loans,
which were no longer exacted. Nevertheless the very reluctance of the
king, first to accept the Petition at all, and then to accept it in an
unequivocal manner, suggests at least that he was conscious that
something more was at stake than the mere confirmation of ancient
liberties. In fact he had sustained a severe defeat at the hands of both
houses of parliament, although the foolish tactics of Eliot, by ruining
all hope of the continuance of that union between the two houses which
had already accomplished so much, enabled the king to represent the
proceedings of the lower house as the work of a seditious minority.

In the interval between the two sessions of parliament the assassination
of Buckingham revealed the wide gulf that had opened between king and
people. A naval lieutenant, John Felton, brooding upon his own wrongs
(especially the refusal of Buckingham to promote him or to see that he
received the pay due to him), read the remonstrances passed by the
commons and believed that it was his duty to sacrifice his life to rid
England of the hated favourite. His deed was welcomed by the populace,
who compared him to David slaying Goliath. Verses and ballads celebrated
England’s delivery, and the duke’s body was conducted to Westminster
Abbey with few mourners but with an escort of the train-bands lest the
citizens of London should defile the corpse. ‘And this’, says a
newsletter, ‘was the obscure catastrophe of that great man.’

The death of Buckingham had removed one obstacle to a good understanding
between king and parliament, and there were other hopeful signs that the
ruinous foreign policy which had alienated the two houses was about to
be changed. The restoration to favour of Abbot and Bristol, and the
admission to the king’s counsels of such men as Richard Weston, named
lord high treasurer in 1629 and created earl of Portland in 1633, and
Wentworth, were sure guarantees against further adventures like the
expeditions to the Isle of Ré. Nevertheless the disagreements about
impositions and religion still remained. Charles ordered that the
customs duties be collected as if they had been granted by parliament.
When merchants tried to land their goods without paying the duties, the
goods were seized, and all attempts to recover them by legal action
failed. One merchant, Richard Chambers, being summoned before the
council, bitterly complained that ‘the merchants are in no part of the
world so skrewed and wrung as in England; that in Turky they have more
incouragement’. After committal to prison he was released on bail,
whereupon he was cited before the Star Chamber, whose proceedings had
been in no way interfered with by the Petition of Right. Another
merchant, John Rolle, whose goods were confiscated, was a member of
parliament. As regards religion, whereas the commons, in their
remonstrances, had demanded the suppression of the Arminians, there were
obvious signs, such as the promotions of Montague and Manwaring, that
this party was in full favour at court.

When parliament reassembled it was soon evident that a stiff contest was
in prospect. It must be confessed that the popular leaders in the
commons chose their ground badly. Instead of presenting a united front
with the lords, as they had done with very satisfactory results in the
earlier part of the previous session, they now elected to stand alone.
They failed to assume the general position that all unparliamentary
taxation was illegal, and chose rather to assail the alleged breach of
privilege involved in the seizure of Rolle’s goods. They then launched
forth into a general attack on the religious policy pursued, displaying
a strong bias that was at once Erastian and puritan. Thus Pym boldly
asserted that parliament was the only power in the land competent to
deal with the new disease of Arminianism, and Eliot that the bishops
could not be trusted with the interpretation of the Thirty-nine
Articles. In fact, the latter orator continued, the presence on the
episcopal bench of men like Montague threatened the total overthrow of
sound religion, which was already undermined by the innovations
introduced by the sect to which he belonged. Most speakers contrived to
represent the Arminians as akin to the Jesuits and to suggest that the
inevitable result of the teaching of the first would be the ultimate
triumph of the second.

Once the religious issue had been definitely raised, there was no longer
any possibility of a compromise. The commons were claiming the right to
determine the religion of England. They insisted that the leaders of the
branch of the Anglican church that was most popular at court should be
silenced. Such demands could never be admitted by Charles. His
sympathies were wholly with those new churchmen who headed the revolt
against the Calvinistic theology that found favour in the sight of the
commons. Montague, at the close of his Appello Caesarem, had written:
‘Popery is for tyranny, puritanisme for anarchy: poperie is originall of
superstition; puritanisme, the high-way unto prophanenesse; both alike
enemies unto piety. . . . Domine Imperator, defende me gladio, et ego te
defendam calamo.’

Eliot’s impetuosity had brought matters to a crisis, and the king felt
he had no option but to defend the church. In his eyes, as in
Montague’s, the puritans intended to disrupt both church and state, and
Charles firmly shared his father’s belief, ‘No bishop, no king’. He
therefore determined to set a term to the commons’ interference in
ecclesiastical affairs and order the speaker to adjourn the house. When
the speaker signified this command, he was met with a loud cry of ‘Noe
hoe’. On his attempt to leave the chair, he was restrained until three
resolutions had been passed: that whoever should introduce any
innovation in religion to bring in either popery or Arminianism should
be accounted a capital enemy of the king and kingdom; that whoever
should advise the levying of tonnage and poundage without parliamentary
sanction should incur like denunciation; and that whoever should pay
tonnage and poundage, under those conditions, should be held a betrayer
of the liberty of the subject and a capital enemy of the king and
kingdom. A week later Charles formally dissolved the parliament, with
a speech in which he contrasted ‘the undutiful and seditious carriage in
the lower house’ with the ‘dutiful demeanors’ of the lords. In a sense
the contrast is fair, and at least some of the blame for the eleven
years’ prerogative government that followed must be laid at the door of
Eliot, whose headlong course had provoked the inevitable; and, moreover,
the fact that one house of parliament was now neutral, or perhaps even
favourable to the king, helps to explain the acquiescence of the country
at large in the intermittence of parliament. On the other hand it is
characteristic of Charles–and the explanation of his ultimate
downfallthat he failed to see in the action of the commons anything more
significant than that ‘some few vipers’ had cast ‘this mist of
undutifulness’ over the eyes of the majority. He could never conceive
that to many of his subjects puritanism was a living faith for which
they were as ready to suffer as had been the martyrs during the Marian
persecution. Similarly he never realized that probably a majority of the
people were deeply attached to parliamentary government and were anxious
to see its extension rather than its curtailment.
