Dispensations

I. Introduction and Definition

A dispensation is a period of time which is identified by its relation
to some particular purpose of God. [1]

As used in the Greek New Testament, the word is OIKONOMIA (Strong’s No.
3622) and is defined as a stewardship, administration, management,
direction, arrangement, order, or plan. [2]

Practically speaking, dispensationalism speaks of the differences
between the administration of human affairs within the sequential
divisions of human history.

1.  From Adam to Abraham, for example, when God’s administration of
    human affairs focused on the entire race as descended from Adam.

2.  From Abraham to Christ, when God’s administration of human affairs
    focused on one particular family, descendants of Abraham. During
    this period of time, or age, a distinction is drawn between two
    divisions of humanity–Jew and Gentile.

3.  From Christ until now, and beyond for an undisclosed period of time;
    when God’s administration of human affairs focuses on one particular
    people, comprised of Jew and Gentile alike in one body–the Church.

Technically speaking, then, the concept of dispensations and
dispensationalism sets forth a principle in Scripture as follows: God
places humanity under different and progressive operational temporal
conditions, for specific and instructional eternal purposes..

1.  These conditions are laid out in various revealed covenants..

2.  These conditions are instructional to us (Gal. 3:24; Rom. 15:4), as
    well as to the angelic realm of creation (Eph. 3:10).

The concept of a dispensation is seen in the parable of Luke 16, and the
details of a “generic” dispensation are seen.

1.  Two parties (v.1): (a) the delegator of duties and (b) the one
    responsible for performing them.

2.  Specific responsibilities are laid out, and understood by the one
    responsible for performing them (vv.1-3, context).

3.  The Delegator holds the one responsible accountable (v.2).

4.  As a result of failure, on the part of the one responsible, the
    stewardship is removed and changed (vv.2,3).

II. Development and Application

The simplest delineation of dispensational truth is to contrast the Old
Testament with the New Testament. Any newborn, babe in Christ can pick
up his/her Bible and observe that basic division.

1.  Old Testament: the administration of Law. God handed down the 10
    commandments, and the entire Law of Moses. This presented humanity
    with the responsibility to work and earn blessings. The end result,
    however, was to demonstrate that man cannot possibly fulfill such a
    high (perfect) standard. Man cannot earn his way into heaven, and
    must be provided for in another way.

2.  New Testament: the administration of Grace. God made provision
    through His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, the means by which mankind
    may be restored to a relationship with Him. Jesus Christ performed
    the perfect work that mankind could not do, and paid the penalty for
    sin on our behalf. The responsibility in this administration is to
    believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and be saved (Acts 16:31).

A more developed study is to view human history (as already mentioned in
the introduction) and observe the distinctions between the different
groupings–Gentile, Jew, and Church.

1.  The Age of the Gentiles. Prior to the calling out of Abraham, all of
    humanity was treated as one body. All were descendants of Adam. God
    revealed Himself to various prophets (e.g. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Job).

2.  The Age of the Jews. Following the calling out of Abraham (Gen. 12),
    a distinction begins to be drawn within humanity. Within the
    descendants of Adam, a particular group is called out that are the
    descendants of Abraham. A division is drawn between Jews and
    Gentiles (non-Jews). It is to the Jews that God reveals Himself
    (e.g. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, the prophets, etc.).
    This does not mean that God disregarded or ignored the Gentiles
    during these thousands of years, for there are many notable Gentiles
    to be found throughout the Old Testament. The significance, though,
    is that the specific revelations, and the revealed Scriptures were
    given primarily to the Jews (Rom. 3:2).

3.  The Age of the Church. With the sacrificial death of Christ on the
    cross of Calvary, a wholly new administration is unveiled. This
    administration had been previously hidden and is referred to as a
    mystery (Eph. 1:9,10; 3:9). During this age, there is no longer a
    distinction between Jew and Gentile (Rom. 10:12; Gal. 3:28; Col.
    1:11).

Further, and more intricate developments can (and ultimately, should) be
drawn in the observation and study of the significantly detailed
covenants within Scripture. These developments typically break down into
a seven-fold division of human history from Adam, through Noah, Abraham,
Moses, David, Christ, and on to eternity. [3]

1.  The Age of Innocence, from the creation of Adam and Eve until they
    fell into sin.

2.  The Age of Conscience, from the fall into sin to Noah’s flood.

3.  The Age of Human Government, from Noah to Abraham.

4.  The Age of Promise, from Abraham to Moses.

5.  The Age of Law, from Moses to Christ.

6.  The Age of Grace, from the death of Christ to the rapture of the
    Church.

7.  The Age of Christ, His personal 1000 year reign, yet future.

The importance of understanding dispensational truth.

We are commanded to do so! (2 Tim. 2:15)

It is critical in avoiding error! Let us say that I commit a personal
sin, an offence before God. Let us say, for the illustration that my sin
is stealing. What then, should be my activity/responsibility to deal
with that sin, and restore my fellowship with the Lord?

Option \#1. I might offer to the Lord a bull without defect as a sin
offering for the sin I have committed (Lev. 4:3ff.). I might bring the
bull to the front door of the church, lay my hand upon its head, and
“slay the bull before the Lord.” Then, I might ask the priest if he
might take some of the blood inside, and sprinkle it around in various
places inside the church. Then of course, the entrails, and the hide
have to be dealt with, and so forth. [Does all of this seem silly to
you? This is what the Bible says is the way to respond after your sin..
Ah, but maybe that administration is no longer in effect . . .]

Option \#2. I might simply pray to the Father, and confess my sin.. If I
do so, He is faithful and just to forgive me of my sin, and to cleanse
me from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). This is the New Testament’s
instruction for the confession of sin.

Granted, the illustration here presented is somewhat absurd, and
intentionally so. No one today would realistically consider operating
under the animal sacrifice administration. It does serve to point out,
however, that the differences between the Old Testament and the New
Testament are significant. Other issues for consideration may not be as
blatantly clear, but they are no less important for an accurate
handling.

III. Summary and Conclusion

Rightly dividing the word of truth means that I must understand the
dispensational division of human history.

The age in which I live is a unique age, with a unique responsibility. I
am to fulfill that responsibility according to the conditions that are
laid down for me in the Scriptures (particularly, the New Testament).

Dispensations in the Scofield Reference Bible

Introduction from Scofield Bible preface

The dispensations are distinguished, exhibiting the progressive order of
God’s dealings with humanity, the increasing purpose which runs through
and links together time periods during which man has been responsible
for specific and varying tests as to his obedience to God, from the
beginning of human history to its end. Although not all Bible students
agree in every detail of the dispensational system presented in this
reference Bible [the Scofield], it is widely recognized that the
distinction between Law and Grace is basic to the understanding of the
Scriptures. As a further aid to comprehending the divine economy of the
ages, a recognition of the dispensations is of highest value, so long as
it is clearly understood that throughout all the Scriptures there is
only one basis of salvation, i.e. by grace through faith; and that
strict limits cannot be placed upon the terminations of all the
dispensations because (1) there is some overlapping, and (2) the
divinely given stewardship may continue after the time of special
testing has ended.

The “dispensations” are a progressive and connected revelation of God’s
dealings with man, given sometimes to the whole race, and at other times
to a particular people, Israel. These different dispensations are not
separate ways of salvation. During each of them man is reconciled to God
in only one way, i.e. by God’s grace through the work of Christ that was
accomplished on the cross and vindicated in His resurrection. Before the
cross, man was saved by in prospect of Christ’s atoning sacrifice,
through believing the revelation thus far given him. Since the cross,
man has been saved by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom
revelation and redemption are consummated.

On man’s part the continuing requirement is obedience to the revelation
of God. This obedience is a stewardship of faith. Although the divine
revelation unfolds progressively, the deposit of truth in the earlier
time periods is not discarded; rather it is cumulative. Thus conscience
(moral responsibility) is an abiding truth in human life (Rom. 2:15;
9:1; 2 Cor. 1:12; 4:2), although it does not continue as a dispensation.
Similarly, the saved of this present dispensation are “not under law” as
a specific test of obedience to divine revelation (Gal. 5:18; Gal. 2:16;
3:11), yet the Law remains an integral part of the Holy Scriptures
which, to the redeemed, are profitable for “instruction in
righteousness” (2 Tim. 3:16,17; Rom. 15:4).

The purpose of each dispensation, then, is to place man under a specific
rule of conduct, but such stewardship is not a condition of salvation.
In every past dispensation unregenerate man has failed, and he has
failed in this present dispensation and will in the future. But
salvation has been and will continue to be available to him by God’s
grace through faith.

Seven dispensations are distinguished in this edition of the Bible:

Innocence (Gen. 1:28)

Conscience or Moral Responsibility (Gen. 3:7)

Human Government (Gen. 8:15)

Promise (Gen. 12:1)

Law (Exo. 19:1)

The Church (Acts 2:1)

Kingdom (Rev. 20:4)

First Dispensation (Gen. 1:28): Innocence

Man was created in innocence, placed in a perfect environment, subjected
to a simple test, and warned of the consequences of disobedience. He was
not compelled to sin but, tempted by Satan, he chose to disobey God. The
woman was deceived; the man transgressed deliberately (1 Tim. 2:14). The
stewardship of Innocence ended in the judgment of the expulsion from
Eden (Gen. 3:24)

Second Dispensation (Gen. 3:7): Conscience (Moral Responsibility)

Man had now sinned, the first promise of redemption was to be given
(Gen. 3:15), and our first parents were to be expelled from Eden
(3:22-24). Man’s sin was a rebellion against a specific command of God
(2:16,17) and marked a transition from theoretical to experiential
knowledge of good and evil. Man sinned by entering the realm of moral
experience by the wrong door when he could have entered by doing right.
So man became as God through a personal experience of the difference
between good and evil, but also unlike God in gaining this experience by
choosing the wrong instead of the right. Thus he was placed by God under
the stewardship of moral responsibility whereby he was accountable to do
all known good, to abstain from all known evil, and to approach God
through blood sacrifice, here instituted in prospect of the finished
work of Christ. The result is set forth in the Adamic Covenant (Gen.
3:14-21). Man failed the test presented to him in this dispensation
also, as he would in others. Although, as the specific test, this era
ended with the flood, man continued in his moral responsibility.

Third Dispensation (Gen. 8:15): Human Government

This dispensation began when Noah and his family left the ark. As Noah
went into a new situation, God subjected humanity to a new test.
Heretofore no man had the right to take another man’s life (compare Gen.
4:10,11,14-15,23,24). In this new dispensation, although man’s direct
moral responsibility to God continued, God delegated to him certain
areas of authority, in which he was to obey God through submission to
his fellow man. So God instituted a corporate relationship of man to man
in human government.

The highest function of government is the protection of human life, out
of which arises the responsibility for capital punishment. Man is not
individually to avenge murder, but as a corporate group he is to
safeguard the sanctity of human life as a gift of God which cannot
rightly be disposed of except as God permits. The powers that be are
ordained of God, and to resist the power is to resist God. Whereas in
the preceding dispensation restraint upon men was internal (Gen.
6:3),God’s Spirit working through moral responsibility, now a new and
external restraint was added, i.e. the power of civil government.

Man failed to rule righteously. That both Jew and Gentile have governed
for self, not for God, is sadly apparent. This failure was seen racially
in the confusion of Babel (Gen. 11:9); in the failure of Israel in the
period of the theocracy, which closed with captivity in Babylon (2 Chr.
36:15-21); and in the failure of the nations in the “times of the
Gentiles” (Dan. 2:31-45).

Man’s rule will finally be superseded by the glorious reign of our Lord
Jesus Christ, whose right to reign is incontestable (Isa. 9:6,7; Jer.
23:5,6; Eze. 21:27; Luke 1:30-33; Rev. 11:15-18; 19:16; 20:4-6).

The dispensation of Human Government was followed as a specific test of
obedience by that of Promise, when God called Abram as His instrument of
blessing to mankind. However, man’s responsibility for government did
not cease but will continue until Christ sets up His kingdom.

Fourth Dispensation (Gen. 12:1): Promise

This dispensation extended from the call of Abram to the giving of the
law at Sinai (Ex. 19). Its stewardship was based on God’s covenant with
Abram, first cited in Gen. 12:1-3, and confirmed and enlarged in Gen.
13:14-17; 15:1-7; 17:1-8; 22:16-18; 26:2-5,24; 28:13-15; 31:13; and
35:9-12.

Observe (1) the specific provisions affecting Abram himself (Gen. 15:15)
and his son and grandson, Isaac and Jacob (Gen. 26:1-5; 28:10-16), under
which individual blessing depended upon individual obedience.

(2) God made an unconditional promise of blessings through Abram’s seed
(a) to the nation Israel to inherit a specific territory forever (Gen.
12:2; 15:18-21; 17:7,8); (b) to the Church as in Christ (Gal.
3:16,28,29); and (c) to the Gentile nations (Gen. 12:3).

(3) There was a promise of blessing upon those individuals and nations
who bless Abram’s descendants, and a curse laid upon those who persecute
the Jews (Gen. 12:3; Matt. 25:31-46). Consequently this dispensation had
varied emphases. To the Gentiles of that period, there was little direct
application other than the test implied by Gen. 12:3 and illustrated by
God’s blessing or judgment on individuals (Pharaoh, Gen. 12:17;
Abimelech, Gen. 20:3,17, etc.), or nations (e.g. Egypt, Gen. 47:47-50;
Ex. 1-15) who treated Abram or his descendants well or ill.

In the continuance through the centuries of this stewardship of truth,
believers of the Church Age are called upon to trust God as Abram did
(Rom. 4:11,16,23-25; Gal. 3:6-9), and thus enter into the blessings of
the covenant which inaugurated the dispensation of Promise.

God’s promises to Abram and his seed certainly did not terminate at
Sinai with the giving of the law (Gal. 3:17). Both OT and NT are full of
post-Sinaitic promises concerning Israel and the land which is to be
Israel’s everlasting possession (e.g. Exo. 32:13; 33:1-3; Lev. 23:10;
25:2; 26:6; Deut. 6:1-23; 8:1-18; Josh. 1:2,11; 24:13; Acts 7:17; Rom.
9:4). But as a specific test of Israel’s stewardship of divine truth,
the dispensation of Promise was superseded, though not annulled, by the
law that was given at Sinai.

Fifth Dispensation (Exo. 19:1): Law

This dispensation began with the giving of the law at Sinai and was
brought to its close as a time-era in the sacrificial death of Christ,
who fulfilled all its provisions and types. In the previous
dispensation, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as multitudes of other
individuals, failed in the tests of faith and obedience which were made
man’s responsibility (e.g. Gen. 16:1-4; 26:6-10; 27:1-25). Egypt also
failed to heed God’s warning (Gen. 12:3) and was judged. God
nevertheless provided a deliverer (Moses), a sacrifice (Passover lamb),
and miraculous power to bring the Israelites out of Egypt (judgments in
Egypt; Red Sea deliverance).

The Israelites as a result of their transgressions (Gal. 3:19) were now
placed under the precise discipline of the law. The law teaches: (1) the
awesome holiness of God (Ex. 19:10-25); (2) the exceeding sinfulness of
sin (Rom. 7:13; 1 Tim. 1:8-10); (3) the necessity of obedience (Jer.
7:23,24): (4) the universality of man’s failure (Rom. 3:19,20); and (5)
the marvel of God’s grace in providing a way of approach to Himself
through typical blood sacrifice, looking forward to a Savior who would
become the Lamb of God to bear away the sin of the world (John 1:29), as
“witnessed by the law” (Rom. 3:21).

The law did not change the provisions or abrogate the promise of God as
given in the Abrahamic Covenant. It was not given as a way to life
(i.e., a means of justification, Acts 15:10,11; Gal. 2:16,21;
3:3-9,14,17,21,24,25), but as a rule of living for a people already in
the covenant of Abraham and covered by blood sacrifice, e.g. Passover
lamb, etc. One of its purposes was to make clear the purity and holiness
which should characterize the life of a people with whom the law of the
nation was at the same time the law of god (Ex. 19:5,6).

Hence, the law’s function in relation to Israel was one of disciplinary
restriction and correction, like that exercised over Greek and Roman
children by the trusted household slave or tutor (Gal. 3:24, translated
“schoolmaster”) to hold Israel in check for their own good (Deut. 6:24):
(1) until Christ should come (Christ is actually our Tutor, for the
grace which saves us also teaches us, Gal. 3:24; Ti. 2:11,12); and (2)
until the Father’s appointed time that the heirs (children of promise)
should be removed from a condition of legal minority into the privileges
of heirs who have come of age (Gal. 4:1-3). This God did in sending His
Son, and believers are now in the position of sons in the Father’s house
(Gal. 3:26; 4:4-7).

But Israel misinterpreted the purpose of the law (1 Tim. 1:8-10), sought
righteousness by good deeds and ceremonial ordinances (Acts 15:1; Rom.
9:31-10:3), and rejected their own Messiah (John 1:10,11). The history
of Israel in the wilderness, in the land, and scattered among the
nations has been one long record of the violation of the law.

Sixth Dispensation (Acts 2:1): The Church

A new age was announced by our Lord Jesus Christ in Mt. 12:47-13:52. The
Church was clearly prophesied by Him in Mt. 16:18 (cp. Mt. 18:15-19),
purchased by the shedding of His blood on Calvary (Rom. 3:24,25; 1 Cor.
6:20; 1 Pet. 1:18,19), and constituted as the Church after His
resurrection and ascension at Pentecost when, in accordance with His
promise (Acts 1:5), individual believers were for the first time
baptized with the Holy Spirit into a unified spiritual organism, likened
to a body of which Christ is the Head (1 Cor 12:12,13; Col. 2:19).
Because of the emphasis upon the Holy Spirit, this age has also be
called “the dispensation of the Spirit.”

The point of testing in this dispensation is the Gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the message of good news about His death and resurrection
(Jn. 19:30; Acts 4:12; 1 Cor. 15:3-5; 2 Cor. 5:21). The continuing,
cumulative revelation of the previous dispensations combines with the
fuller revelation to emphasize the utter sinfulness and lostness of man
and the adequacy of the historically completed work of Christ to save by
grace through faith all who come unto God by Him (Jn. 14:6; Acts 10:43;
13:38,39; Rom. 3:21-26; Eph. 2:8,9; 1 Tim. 4:10; Heb. 10:12-14; 11:6).
As those saved individuals who compose Christ’s true Church fulfill
their Lord’s command to preach the Gospel to the ends of the earth (Mk.
16:15; Lk. 24:46-48; Acts 1:8), God during this age is taking out from
Jews and Gentiles “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14), called “the
Church” and henceforth carefully distinguished from both Jews and
Gentiles as such (1 Cor. 10:32; Gal. 3:27,28; Eph. 2:11-18; 3:5,6).

The Lord Jesus warned that during the whole period, while the Church is
being formed by the Holy Spirit, many will reject His Gospel, and many
others will pretend to believe in Him and will become a source of
spiritual corruption and hindrance to His purpose in this age, in the
professing church. These will bring apostasy, particularly in the last
days (Mt. 13:24-30,36-40,47-49; 2 Th. 2:5-8; 1 Tim. 4:1,2; 2 Tim. 3:1;
4:3,4; 2 Pet. 2:1,2; 1 Jn. 2:18-20).

The Church Age will be brought to a close by a series of prophesied
events, the chief of which are: (1) the translation of the true Church
from the earth to meet her Lord in the air at a point of time known to
God but unrevealed to men, and ever held before believers as an imminent
and happy hope, encouraging them in loving service and holiness of life.
This event is often called “the rapture” (see 1 Th. 4:17). (2) The
judgments of the seventieth week of Daniel, called “the tribulation”
(see Rev. 7:14), which will fall upon mankind in general but will
include the unsaved portion of the professing church, which will have
gone into apostasy and thus be left behind on earth when the true Church
is translated to heaven. This final form of apostate church is described
in Rev. 17 as “the harlot” which will first (ride) the political power
(“beast”), only to be overthrown and absorbed by that power (cp. Rev.
18:2). And (3) the return from heaven to earth of our Lord Jesus Christ
in power and glory, bringing with Him the Church, to set up His
millennial kingdom of righteousness and peace (see Rev. 19:11 and 17).

The Seventh Dispensation (Rev. 20:4): The Kingdom

This is the last of the ordered ages which condition human life on the
earth. It is the kingdom covenanted to David (2 Sam. 7:8-17; Zech. 12:8;
Lk. 1:31-33; 1 Cor. 15:24). David’s greater Son, the Lord Jesus Christ,
will rule over the earth as King of kings and Lord of lords, for 1000
years, associating with Himself in that reign His saints of all ages
(Rev. 3:21; 5:9,10; 11:15-18; 15:3,4; 19:16; 20:4,6).

The Kingdom Age gathers into itself under Christ the various “times”
spoken of in the Scriptures: (1) the time of oppression and misrule ends
when Christ establishes His kingdom (Isa. 11:3,4); (2) the time of
testimony and divine forbearance ends in judgment (Mt. 25:31-46; Acts
17:30,31; Rev. 20:7-15); (3) the time of toil ends in rest and reward (1
Th. 1:6,7), (4) the time of suffering ends in glory (Rom. 8:17,18), (5)
the time of Israel’s blindness and chastisement ends in restoration and
conversion (Ezek. 39:25-29; Rom. 11:25-27); (6) the times of the
Gentiles end in the smiting of the image and the setting up of the
kingdom of the heavens (Dan. 2:34,35; Rev. 19:15-21); and (7) the time
of creation’s bondage ends in deliverance at the manifestation of the
sons of God (Gen. 3:17; Isa. 11:6-8; Rom. 8:19-21).

At the conclusion of the thousand years, Satan is released for a little
season and instigates a final rebellion which is summarily put down by
the Lord. Christ casts Satan into the lake of fire to be eternally
tormented, defeats the last enemy, death, and then delivers up the
kingdom to the Father.
