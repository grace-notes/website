**Pentecost (Schaff) 5**

Notes on Pentecost
==================

From Philip Schaff, ***History of the Christian Church,***Volume 1,
Chapter 4

The ascension of Christ to heaven was followed ten days afterwards by
the descent of the Holy Spirit upon earth and the birth of the Christian
Church. The Pentecostal event was the necessary result of the Passover
event. It could never have taken place without the preceding
resurrection and ascension. It was the first act of the mediatorial
reign of the exalted Redeemer in heaven, and the beginning of an
unbroken series of manifestations in fulfillment of his promise to be
with his people “always, even unto the end of the world.” For his
ascension was only a withdrawal of his visible local presence, and the
beginning of his spiritual omnipresence in the church which is “his
body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.” The Easter miracle and
the Pentecostal miracle are continued and verified by the daily moral
miracles of regeneration and sanctification throughout Christendom.

We have but one authentic account of that epoch-making event, in the
second chapter of Acts, but in the parting addresses of our Lord to his
disciples the promise of the Paraclete who should lead them into the
whole truth is very prominent, and the entire history of the apostolic
church is illuminated and heated by the Pentecostal fire.

Pentecost, i.e. the fiftieth day after the Passover-Sabbath, was a feast
of joy and gladness, in the loveliest season of the year, and attracted
a very large number of visitors to Jerusalem from foreign lands. It was
one of the three great annual festivals of the Jews in which all the
males were required to appear before the Lord. Passover was the first,
and the feast of Tabernacles the third. Pentecost lasted one day, but
the foreign Jews, after the period of the captivity, prolonged it to two
days. It was the “feast of harvest,” or “of the first fruits,” and also
(according to rabbinical tradition) the anniversary celebration of the
Sinaitic legislation, which is supposed to have taken place on the
fiftieth day after the Exodus from the land of bondage.

This festival was admirably adapted for the opening event in the history
of the apostolic church. It pointed typically to the first Christian
harvest, and the establishment of the new theocracy in Christ; as the
sacrifice of the paschal lamb and the exodus from Egypt foreshadowed the
redemption of the world by the crucifixion of the Lamb of God. On no
other day could the effusion of the Spirit of the exalted Redeemer
produce such rich results and become at once so widely known. We may
trace to this day not only the origin of the mother church at Jerusalem,
but also the conversion of visitors from other cities, as Damascus,
Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome, who on their return would carry the glad
tidings to their distant homes. For the strangers enumerated by Luke as
witnesses of the great event, represented nearly all the countries in
which Christianity was planted by the labors of the apostles.

The Pentecost in the year of the Resurrection was the last Jewish (i.e.
typical) and the first Christian Pentecost. It became the spiritual
harvest feast of redemption from sin, and the birthday of the visible
kingdom of Christ on earth. It marks the beginning of the dispensation
of the Spirit, the third era in the history of the revelation of the
triune God. On this day the Holy Spirit, who had hitherto wrought only
sporadically and transiently, took up his permanent abode in mankind as
the Spirit of truth and holiness, with the fullness of saving grace, to
apply that grace thenceforth to believers, and to reveal and glorify
Christ in their hearts, as Christ had revealed and glorified the Father.

While the apostles and disciples, about one hundred and twenty (ten
times twelve) in number, no doubt mostly Galileans, were assembled
before the morning devotions of the festal day, and were waiting in
prayer for the fulfillment of the promise, the exalted Savior sent from
his heavenly throne the Holy Spirit upon them, and founded his church
upon earth. The Sinaitic legislation was accompanied by “thunder and
lightning, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the
trumpet exceeding loud, and all the people that was in the camp
trembled.” The church of the new covenant war, ushered into existence
with startling signs which filled the spectators with wonder and fear.
It is quite natural, as Neander remarks, that “the greatest miracle in
the inner life of mankind should have been accompanied by extraordinary
outward phenomena as sensible indications of its presence.”

A supernatural sound resembling that of a rushing mighty wind, came down
from heaven and filled the whole house in which they were assembled; and
tongues like flames of fire, distributed themselves among them,
alighting for a while on each head. It is not said that these phenomena
were really wind and fire, they are only compared to these elements, as
the form which the Holy Spirit assumed at the baptism of Christ is
compared to a dove. The tongues of flame were gleaming, but neither
burning nor consuming; they appeared and disappeared like electric
sparks or meteoric flashes. But these audible and visible signs were
appropriate symbols of the purifying, enlightening, and quickening power
of the Divine Spirit, and announced a new spiritual creation. The form
of tongues referred to the glossolalia, and the apostolic eloquence as a
gift of inspiration.

“And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.” This is the real inward
miracle, the main fact, the central idea of the Pentecostal narrative.
To the apostles it was their baptism, confirmation, and ordination, all
in one, for they received no other. To them it was the great inspiration
which enabled them hereafter to be authoritative teachers of the gospel
by tongue and pen. Not that it superseded subsequent growth in
knowledge, or special revelations on particular points (as Peter receive
at Joppa, and Paul on several occasions); but they were endowed with
such an understanding of Christ’s words and plan of salvation as they
never had before.

What was dark and mysterious became now clear and full of meaning to
them. The Spirit revealed to them the person and work of the Redeemer in
the light of his resurrection and exaltation, and took full possession
of their mind and heart. They were raised, as it were, to the mount of
transfiguration, and saw Moses and Elijah and Jesus above them, face to
face, swimming in heavenly light. They had now but one desire to
gratify, but one object to live for, namely, to be witnesses of Christ
and instruments of the salvation of their fellow-men, that they too
might become partakers of their “inheritance incorruptible, and
undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven.”

But the communication of the Holy Spirit was not confined to the Twelve.
It extended to the brethren of the Lord, the mother of Jesus, the pious
women who had attended his ministry, and the whole brotherhood of a
hundred and twenty souls who were assembled in that chamber. They were
“all” filled with the Spirit, and all spoke with tongues; and Peter saw
in the event the promised outpouring of the Spirit upon “all flesh,”
sons and daughters, young men and old men, servants and handmaidens.

It is characteristic that in this spring season of the church the women
were sitting with the men, not in a separate court as in the temple, nor
divided by a partition as in the synagogue and the decayed churches of
the East to this day, but in the same room as equal sharers in the
spiritual blessings. The beginning was a prophetic anticipation of the
end, and a manifestation of the universal priesthood and brotherhood of
believers in Christ, in whom all are one, whether Jew or Greek, bond or
free, male or female.

This new spiritual life, illuminated, controlled, and directed by the
Holy Spirit, manifested itself first in the speaking with tongues
towards God, and then in the prophetic testimony towards the people. The
former consisted of rapturous prayers and anthems of praise, the latter
of sober teaching and exhortation. From the Mount of Transfiguration the
disciples, like their Master, descended to the valley below to heal the
sick and to call sinners to repentance.

The mysterious gift of tongues, or glossolalia, appears here for the
first time, but became, with other extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, a
frequent phenomenon in the apostolic churches, especially at Corinth,
and is fully described by Paul. The distribution of the flaming tongues
to each of the disciples caused the speaking with tongues. A new
experience expresses itself always in appropriate language. The
supernatural experience of the disciples broke through the confines of
ordinary speech and burst out in ecstatic language of praise and
thanksgiving to God for the great works he did among them.

It was the Spirit himself who gave them utterance and played on their
tongues, as on new tuned harps, unearthly melodies of praise. The
glossolalia was here, as in all cases where it is mentioned, an act of
worship and adoration, not an act of teaching and instruction, which
followed afterwards in the sermon of Peter. It was the first Te Deum of
the new-born church. It expressed itself in unusual, poetic, dithyrambic
style and with a peculiar musical intonation. It was intelligible only
to those who were in sympathy with the speaker; while unbelievers
scoffingly ascribed it to madness or excess of wine. Nevertheless it
served as a significant sign to all and arrested their attention to the
presence of a supernatural power.

So far we may say that the Pentecostal glossolalia was the same as that
in the household of Cornelius in Caesarea after his conversion, which
may be called a Gentile Pentecost, as that of the twelve disciples of
John the Baptist at Ephesus, where it appears in connection with
prophesying, and as that in the Christian congregation at Corinth.

But at its first appearance the speaking with tongues differed in its
effect upon the hearers by coming home to them at once in their own
mother-tongues; while in Corinth it required an interpretation to be
understood. The foreign spectators, at least a number of them, believed
that the unlettered Galileans spoke intelligibly in the different
dialects represented on the occasion. We must therefore suppose either
that the speakers themselves, were endowed, at least temporarily, and
for the particular purpose of proving their divine mission, with the
gift of foreign languages not learned by them before, or that the Holy
Spirit who distributed the tongues acted also as interpreter of the
tongues, and applied the utterances of the speakers to the susceptible
among the hearers.

The former is the most natural interpretation of Luke’s language.
Nevertheless I suggest the other alternative as preferable, for the
following reasons: 1. The temporary endowment with a supernatural
knowledge of foreign languages involves nearly all the difficulties of a
permanent endowment, which is now generally abandoned, as going far
beyond the data of the New Testament and known facts of the early spread
of the gospel. 2. The speaking with tongues began before the spectators
arrived, that is before there was any motive for the employment of
foreign languages. 3. The intervening agency of the Spirit harmonizes
the three accounts of Luke, and Luke and Paul, or the Pentecostal and
the Corinthian glossolalia; the only difference remaining is that in
Corinth the interpretation of tongues was made by men in audible speech,
in Jerusalem by the Holy Spirit in inward illumination and application.
4. The Holy Spirit was certainly at work among the hearers as well as
the speakers, and brought about the conversion of three thousand on that
memorable day. If he applied and made effective the sermon of Peter, why
not also the preceding doxologies and benedictions? 5. Peter makes no
allusion to foreign languages, nor does the prophecy of Joel which he
quotes. 6. This view best explains the opposite effect upon the
spectators. They did by no means all understand the miracle, but the
mockers, like those at Corinth, thought the disciples were out of their
right mind and talked not intelligible words in their native dialects,
but unintelligible nonsense. The speaking in a foreign language could
not have been a proof of drunkenness. It may be objected to this view
that it implies a mistake on the part of the hearers who traced the use
of their mother-tongues directly to the speakers; but the mistake
referred not to the fact itself, but only to the mode. It was the same
Spirit who inspired the tongues of the speakers and the hearts of the
susceptible hearers, and raised both above the ordinary level of
consciousness.

Whichever view we take of this peculiar feature of the Pentecostal
glossolalia, in this diversified application to the cosmopolitan
multitude of spectators, it was a symbolical anticipation and prophetic
announcement of the universality of the Christian religion, which was to
be proclaimed in all the languages of the earth and to unite all nations
in one kingdom of Christ. The humility and love of the church united
what the pride and hatred of Babel had scattered. In this sense we may
say that the Pentecostal harmony of tongues was the counterpart of the
Babylonian confusion of tongues..

The speaking with tongues was followed by the sermon of Peter; the act
of devotion, by an act of teaching; the rapturous language of the soul
in converse with God, by the sober words of ordinary self-possession for
the benefit of the people.

While the assembled multitude wondered at this miracle with widely
various emotions, St. Peter, the Rock-man, appeared in the name of all
the disciples, and addressed them with remarkable clearness and force,
probably in his own vernacular Aramaic, which would be most familiar to
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, possibly in Greek, which would be better
understood by the foreign visitors. He humbly condescended to refute the
charge of intoxication by reminding them of the early hour of the day,
when even drunkards are sober, and explained from the prophecies of Joel
and the sixteenth Psalm of David the meaning of the supernatural
phenomenon, as the work of that Jesus of Nazareth, whom the Jews had
crucified, but who was by word and deed, by his resurrection from the
dead, his exaltation to the right hand of God, and the effusion of the
Holy Ghost, accredited as the promised Messiah, according to the express
prediction of the Scripture. Then he called upon his hearers to repent
and be baptized in the name of Jesus, as the founder and head of the
heavenly kingdom, that even they, though they had crucified him, the
Lord and the Messiah, might receive the forgiveness of sins and the gift
of the Holy Ghost, whose wonderful workings they saw and heard in the
disciples.

This was the first independent testimony of the apostles, the first
Christian sermon: simple, unadorned, but full of Scripture truth,
natural, suitable, pointed, and more effective than any other sermon has
been since, though fraught with learning and burning with eloquence. It
resulted in the conversion and baptism of three thousand persons,
gathered as first-fruits into the garners of the church.

In these first-fruits of the glorified Redeemer, and in this founding of
the new economy of Spirit and gospel, instead of the old theocracy of
letter and law, the typical meaning of the Jewish Pentecost was
gloriously fulfilled. But this birth-day of the Christian church is in
its turn only the beginning, the type and pledge, of a still greater
spiritual harvest and a universal feast of thanksgiving, when, in the
full sense of the prophecy of Joel, the Holy Spirit shall be poured out
on all flesh, when all the sons and daughters of men shall walk in his
light, and God shall be praised with new tongues of fire for the
completion of his wonderful work of redeeming love.
