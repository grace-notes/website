The word gospel is translated from the Greek (**euaggelos**), which means good news. Bad news, therefore, such as doctrines pertaining to evil or to personal sins, do not properly belong under the category of the gospel.

The gospel includes all of the doctrines pertaining to salvation, including: redemption, expiation, reconciliation, propitiation, imputation, justification, positional truth, and sanctification. It also includes the doctrines pertaining to the Lord Jesus Christ, including: the hypostatic union, impeccability, the deity of Christ, etc.

There are six uses of the term gospel in the New Testament:

* The gospel of Christ; Rom. 1:16,17, “_I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ…_” This is an emphasis on the person of the gospel.

* My gospel, Rom. 2:16 This means that the gospel belongs to every
believer.

* Our gospel, 2 Cor. 4:3,4. This verse speaks of the believer’s possession of the gospel and the importance of communicating it as God gives opportunity in witnessing.

* The gospel of peace, Eph. 6:15. This emphasizes the doctrine of reconciliation in the gospel.

* The everlasting gospel, Rev. 14:6. This emphasizes the proximity of eternity for unbelievers during the tribulation.

* The gospel of the kingdom, Matt. 24:14. This emphasizes the fulfillment of the unconditional covenant to the born again of Israel.

The fundamentals of the gospel are given in 1 Cor. 15:1-4.

* Christ died as a substitute for our sins. His spiritual death means It is finished!

* Christ died physically and was buried

* Christ rose from the dead

The enemy of the gospel is Satan who is the ruler of this world, 2 Cor. 4:3,4.

The believer’s attitude toward the gospel is expressed in these verses:

Rom. 1:16, 20;; 1 Cor. 1:17;9:1
