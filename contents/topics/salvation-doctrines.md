> _“The Christian who does not understand what God has done in the past,
> and does not have faith in what God will do in the future, will be
> overwhelmed by today’s crisis.”_ __Chester McCalley__


Your Christian life began the moment you believed the Gospel, putting
your complete confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation. At that
moment, God provided you with a great number of unique and permanent
blessings. _“…and hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
heavenly places in Christ.”_ (Eph. 1:3) These blessings are a part of
your inheritance as a Christian; they are the doctrines and promises
upon which you may draw during the remainder of your lifetime.

The following is a listing of salvation doctrines, a catalogue of the
things God did for you when you accepted Christ. These basic teachings
are the underlying principles for the mechanics of Christian living, the
techniques such as faith rest and occupation with Christ, and are
foundation principles for all other Bible doctrine.

This listing can provide you with hours of quality study and meditation.
You may well find other topics that could be added to the list. It is
valuable and important that you understand thoroughly your relationship
with the Lord; a good knowledge of these doctrines can be of great help
to you in solving problems and making decisions according to God’s
viewpoint.

You are **in the eternal plan of God**, sharing the destiny of the Lord
Jesus Christ. As such you are:

**Foreknown**

* **Acts 2:23**. "_this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan
  and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of
  godless men and put Him to death._"

* **Romans 8:29**. "_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to
  become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the
  firstborn among many brethren;_"

* **1 Peter 1:2**. "_according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
  by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be
  sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest
  measure._"

**Elect**

* **Romans 8:33**. "_Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is
  the one who justifies;_"

* **Colossians 3:12**. "_So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy
  and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility,
  gentleness and patience;_"

* **1 Thessalonians 1:4**. "_knowing, brethren beloved by God, His
  choice of you;_"

* **Titus 1:1**. "_Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus
  Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the
  truth which is according to godliness,_"

* **1 Peter 1:1, 2**. "_Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who
  reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
  Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen_"

**Predestined**

* **Romans 8:29, 30**. "_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined
  to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that *He would be the
  firstborn among many brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also
  called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He
  justified, He also glorified._"

* **Ephesians 1:5.** "_He predestined us to adoption as sons through
  Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will_"

* **Ephesians 1:11**. "_also we have obtained an inheritance, having
  been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after
  the counsel of His will,_"

**Chosen in Christ**

* **Matthew 22:14**. "_For many are called, but few are chosen._"

* **1 Peter 2:4**. "_And coming to Him as to a living stone which has
  been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God_"

**Called**

* **1 Thessalonians 5:24**. "_Faithful is He who calls you, and He also
  will bring it to pass._"

You have been **reconciled** …

**Reconciled by God**

* **2 Corinthians 5:18**. "_Now all these things are from God, who
  reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of
  reconciliation,_"

* **Colossians 1:20**. "_and through Him to reconcile all things to
  Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through
  Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven._"

**Reconciled to God**

* **Romans 5:10**. "_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to
  God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled,
  we shall be saved by His life._"

* **2 Corinthians 5:20**. "_Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as
  though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of
  Christ, be reconciled to God._"

* **Ephesians 2:14-16**. "_For He Himself is our peace, who made both
  groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by
  abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments
  contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into
  one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in
  one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the
  enmity._"

**You have been _redeemed_** (purchased from the slave market of sin).

* **Romans 3:24**. "_being justified as a gift by His grace through the
  redemption which is in Christ Jesus;_"

* **Colossians 1:14**. "_in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of
  sins._"

* **1 Peter 1:18**. "_knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable
  things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from
  your forefathers,_"

* **Ephesians 1:7**. "_In Him we have redemption through His blood, the
  forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace_"

You have been **removed from condemnation.**

* **John 3:18**. "_He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not
  believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the
  name of the only begotten Son of God._"

* **John 5:24**. "_Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and
  believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into
  judgment, but has passed out of death into life._"

* **Romans 8:1**. "_Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who
  are in Christ Jesus._"

You are **under grace** _and not under judgment (doctrine of
propitiation)._

* **Romans 3:24–28**. "_being justified as a gift by His grace through
  the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God displayed publicly
  as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate
  His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over
  the sins previously committed; for the demonstration, I say, of His
  righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the
  justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Where then is boasting?
  It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of
  faith. For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from
  works of the Law._"

* **1 John 2:2**. "_and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and
  not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world._"

Your **sins have been judged** by the spiritual death of Christ on the
cross:

* **Romans 4:25**. "_He who was delivered over because of our
  transgressions, and was raised because of our justification._"

* **Ephesians 1:7**. "_In Him we have redemption through His blood, the
  forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace_"

* **1 Peter 2:24**. "_and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the
  cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by
  His wounds you were healed._"

You have been made **dead to the old life and alive unto God**. You are:

**Crucified with Christ**

* **Romans 6:6**. "_knowing this, that our old self was crucified with
  Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we
  would no longer be slaves to sin;_"

* **Galatians 2:20**. "_I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no
  longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now
  live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and
  gave Himself up for me._"

**Dead with Christ**

* **Romans 6:8**. "_Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we
  shall also live with Him,_"

* **Colossians 3:3**. "_For you have died and your life is hidden with
  Christ in God._"

* **1 Peter 2:24**. "_and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the
  cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by
  His wounds you were healed._"

**Buried with Christ**

* **Romans 6:4**. "_Therefore we have been buried with Him through
  baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through
  the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life._"

* **Colossians 2:12**. "_having been buried with Him in baptism, in
  which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of
  God, who raised Him from the dead._"

**Risen with Christ**

* **Romans 6:4**. "_Therefore we have been buried with Him through
  baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through
  the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life._"

* **Colossians 3:1**. "_Therefore if you have been raised up with
  Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the
  right hand of God._"

You are **free from the law**.

* **Romans 6:14**. "_For sin shall not be master over you, for you are
  not under law but under grace._"

* **Romans 7:4-6**. "_Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die
  to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to
  another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might
  bear fruit for God. For while we were in the flesh, the sinful
  passions, which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members
  of our body to bear fruit for death. But now we have been released
  from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we
  serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter._"

* **2 Corinthians 3:11**. "_For if that which fades away was with glory,
  much more that which remains is in glory._"

* **Galatians 3:25**. "_But now that faith has come, we are no longer
  under a tutor_ [the Law]."

You have been **adopted** (placed as an adult heir in the family of God)

* **Romans 8:15**. "_For you have not received a spirit of slavery
  leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as
  sons by which we cry out, 'Abba! Father!'_"

* **Romans 8:23**. "_And not only this, but also we ourselves, having
  the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
  ourselves, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of
  our body._"

* **Ephesians 1:5**. "_He predestined us to adoption as sons through
  Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His
  will,_"

You have been **justified** (declared righteous).

* **Romans 3:24**. "_being justified as a gift by His grace through the
  redemption which is in Christ Jesus;_"

* **Romans 5:1**. "_Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have
  peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,_"

* **Romans 5:9**. "_Much more then, having now been justified by His
  blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him._"

* **Romans 8:30**. "_and these whom He predestined, He also called; and
  these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified,
  He also glorified._"

* **1 Corinthians 6:11**. "_Such were some of you; but you were washed,
  but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the
  Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God._"

* **Titus 3:7**. "_so that being justified by His grace we would be made
  heirs according to *the* hope of eternal life._"

You have been **regenerated** (born spiritually into the family of God)

* **John 13:10**. "_Jesus said to him, “He who has bathed needs only to
  wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all
  of you._"

* **1 Corinthians 6:11**. "_Such were some of you; but you were washed,
  but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the
  Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God._"

* **Titus 3:5**. "_He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have
  done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of
  regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,_"

**By regeneration you are:**

**Born Again**

* **John 3:7.** "_Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born
  again._"

* **1 Peter 1:23**. "_for you have been born again not of seed which is
  perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring
  word of God._"

* **1 John 3:2**. "_Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not
  appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will
  be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is._"

**New Creations**

* **2 Corinthians 5:17**. "_Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a
  new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have
  come._"

* **Galatians 6:15**. "_For neither is circumcision anything, nor
  uncircumcision, but a new creation._"

* **Ephesians 2:10**. "_For we are His workmanship, created in Christ
  Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would
  walk in them._"

**You have been made _acceptable to God_**.

  freely bestowed on us in the Beloved._"

* **1 Peter 2:5**. "_you also, as living stones, are being built up as a
  spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
  sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ._"

To make a believer acceptable to Himself, God sees to it that you have
been:

**Made righteous**

  Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;_"
