Concluding Remarks on the Composition of the Pentateuch

From *Commentary on the Old Testament*, C. F. Keil and F. Delitzsch.

If we close our commentary with another survey of the entire work, viz.,
the five books of Moses, we may sum up the result of our detailed
exposition, so far as critical opinions respecting its origin are
concerned, in these words: We have found the decision which we
pronounced in our General Introduction, as to the internal unity and
system of the whole Thorah, as well as its Mosaic origin, thoroughly
confirmed. With the exception of the last chapters of the fifth book,
which are distinctly shown to be an appendix to the Mosaic Thorah, added
by a different hand, by the statement in Deuteronomy 31:24ff., that when
the book of the law was finished Moses handed it over to the Levites to
keep, there is nothing in the whole of the five books which Moses might
not have written.

There are no historical circumstances or events either mentioned or
assumed, which occurred for the first time after Moses was dead. Neither
the allusion to the place called Dan in Gen. 14:14 (cf. Deuteronomy
34:1); nor the remark in Gen. 36:1, that there were kings in the land of
Edom before the children of Israel had a king over them; nor the
statement that the monument which Jacob erected over Rachel’s grave
remained “to this day” (Gen. 35:20); nor even the assertion in
Deuteronomy 3:14, that Jair called Bashan “Chavvoth Jair” after his own
name, furnishes any definite and unmistakeable indication of a
post-Mosaic time.39 And the account in Ex. 16:35, that the Israelites
ate the manna forty years, till they came to an inhabited land, “to the
end,” i.e., the extreme boundary, of the land of Canaan, could only be
adduced by Bleek (Einl. p. 204) as an evident proof that “this could not
have been written before the arrival of the Israelites in the land of
Canaan,” through a παρερμηνεία, or misinterpretation of the words, “into
the land of their dwelling.” For were not the Israelites on the border
of the land when they were encamped in the steppes of Moab by the Jordan
opposite to Jericho?

Or are we to suppose that the kingdoms of Sihon and Og with their
cities, which the Israelites had already conquered under Moses, were an
uninhabited land? The passage mentioned last simply proves, that in the
middle books of the Pentateuch we have not simple diaries before us
containing the historical occurrences of the Mosaic times, but a work
drawn up according to a definite plan, and written in the last year of
Moses’ life. This is apparent from the remarks about the shining face of
Moses (Ex. 34:33–35), and the guidance of Israel in all its journeys by
the pillar of cloud (Ex. 40:38, cf. Num. 10:34), as well as from the
systematic arrangement and distribution of the materials according to
certain well-defined and obvious points of view, as we have already
endeavoured to show in the introductions to the different books, and in
the exposition itself.

If, however, the composition of the whole Thorah by Moses is thus firmly
established, in accordance with the statements in Deuteronomy 31:9 and
24, it by no means follows that Moses wrote the whole work from Gen. 1
to Deuteronomy 31 uno tenore, and in the closing days of his life. Even
in this case it may have been written step by step; and not only
Genesis, but the three middle books, may have been composed before the
discourses in the fifth book, so that the whole work was simply finished
and closed after the renewal of the covenant recorded in Deuteronomy 29
and 30. Again, such statements as that Moses wrote this law, and made an
end of writing the words of this law in a book till they were finished
(Deuteronomy 31:9 and 24), by no means require us to assume that Moses
wrote it all with his own hand.

The epistles which the Apostle Paul sent to the different churches were
rarely written with his own hand, but were dictated to one of his
assistants; yet their Pauline origin is not called in question in
consequence. And so Moses may have employed some assistant, either a
priest or scribe (shoter), in the composition of the book of the law,
without its therefore failing to be his own work. Still less is the
Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch rendered doubtful by the fact that
he availed himself of written documents from earlier times in writing
the primeval history, and incorporated them to some extent in the book
of Genesis without alteration; and that in the history of his own time,
and when introducing the laws into his work, he inserted documents in
the middle books which had been prepared by the priests and shoterim at
his own command,—such, for example, as the lists of the numbering of the
people (Num. 1–3 and 26), the account of the dedicatory offerings of the
tribe-princes (Num. 7), and of the committee of heads of tribes
appointed for the purpose of dividing the land of Canaan (Num.
34:16ff.),—in the exact form in which they had been drawn up for public
use. This conjecture is rendered very natural by the contents and form
of the Pentateuch.

The Pentateuch contains historical narrative and law, answering to the
character of the divine revelation, which consisted in historical facts,
and received a development in accordance with the times. And on closer
inspection we find that several different elements may be distinguished
in each of these. The historical contents are divisible into an
annalistic or monumental portion, and into prophetico-historical
accounts. The former includes the simple notices of the most important
events from the creation of the world to the death of Moses, with their
exact chronological, ethnographical, and geographical data; also the
numerous genealogical documents introduced into the history.

To the latter belong statements, whether shorter or longer, respecting
those revelations and promises of God, by which the Creator of the
heaven and the earth prepared the way from the very earliest time for
the redemption of the fallen human race, and which, after laying the
foundation for the Old Testament kingdom of God by the guidance of the
patriarchs and the redemption of Israel out of the bondage of Egypt, He
eventually carried out at Sinai by the conclusion of a covenant and the
giving of a law.

In the same way, we may distinguish a twofold element in the legal
portion of the Pentateuch. The kernel of the Sinaitic legislation is to
be found in the decalogue, with the moral and rightful conditions upon
the basis of which the Lord concluded the covenant with Israel. The
religious and moral truths and commandments, which, as being the
absolute demands of the holiness and justice, the love and mercy of God,
constitute the very essence of true religion, are surrounded in the
covenant economy of the Old Testament by certain religious statutes and
institutions, which were imposed upon the people of God simply for the
time of its infancy, and constituted that “shadow of things to come”
which was to pass away when the “body” appeared.

This “shadow” embraces all the special theocratic ordinances and
precepts of the so-called Levitical law (whether ecclesiastical,
disciplinary, or magisterial), in which religious and ethical ideas were
symbolically incorporated; so that they contained within them eternal
truths, whilst their earthly form was to pass away. These covenant
statutes are so intimately bound up with the general religious doctrines
and the purely moral commands, by virtue of their symbolical
significance, that in many respects they interlace one another, the
moral commands being enclosed and pervaded by the covenant statutes, and
the latter again being sanctified and transformed by the former, so that
the entire law assumes the form of a complete organic whole.

A similar organic connection is also apparent between the historical and
legal constituents of the Pentateuch. The historical narrative not only
supplied the framework or outward setting for the covenant legislation,
but it also prepared the way for that legislation, just as God Himself
prepared the way for concluding the covenant with Israel by His guidance
of the human race and the patriarchs of Israel; and it so pervades every
portion of it also, that, on the one hand, the historical circumstances
form the groundwork for the legal institutions, and on the other hand a
light is thrown by the historical occurrences upon the covenant
ordinances and laws. Just as nature and spirit interpenetrate each other
in the world around us and in human life, and the spirit not only comes
to view in the life of nature, but transforms it at the same time; so
has God planted His kingdom of grace in the natural order of the world,
that nature may be sanctified by grace. But, notwithstanding this
organic connection between the various constituents of the Pentateuch,
from the very nature of the case not only are the historical and legal
portions kept quite distinct from one another in many passages, but the
distinctions between these two constituents are here and there brought
very clearly out to view.

The material differences necessarily determined in various ways the form
of the narrative, the phraseology, and even the words employed. In the
historical portions many words and expressions occur which are never met
with in the legal sections, and vice versa. The same remark also applies
to the different portions in which we have either historical narrative,
or the promulgation of laws. In addition to this, we might reasonably
expect to find whole sections also, in which the ideas and verbal
peculiarities of the different constituents are combined.

And this is really the case. The differences stand out very sharply in
the earliest chapters of Genesis, where the account of paradise and the
fall, together with the promise of the victory of the seed of the woman
over the serpent, which contains the germ of all future revelations of
God (Gen. 2:4ff.), is appended immediately to the history of the
creation of the world (Deuteronomy 1:1–2:3); whilst in the mode of
narration it differs considerably from the style of the first chapter.
Whereas in Deuteronomy 1 the Creator of the heaven and the earth is
called Elohim simply; in the history of paradise and the fall, not to
mention other differences, we meet with the composite name Jehovah
Elohim; and, after this, the two names Elohim and Jehovah are used
interchangeably, so that in many chapters the former only occurs, and in
others again only the latter, until the statement in Ex. 6, that God
appeared to Moses and commissioned him to bring the people of Israel out
of Egypt, after which the name Jehovah predominates, so that henceforth,
with but few exceptions, Elohim is only used in an appellative sense.

Upon this interchange in the names of God in the book of Genesis, modern
critics have built up their hypothesis as to the composition of Genesis,
and in fact of the entire Pentateuch, either from different documents,
or from repeated supplementary additions, in accordance with which they
discover an outward cause for the change of names, viz., the variety of
editors, instead of deducing it from the different meanings of the names
themselves; whilst they also adduce, in support of their view, the fact
that certain ideas and expressions change in connection with the name of
God.

The fact is obvious enough. But the change in the use of the different
names of God is associated with the gradual development of the saving
purposes of God; and as we have already shown on pp. 45ff., the names
Elohim and Jehovah are expressive of different relations on the part of
God to the world. Now, as God did not reveal Himself in the full
significance of His name Jehovah till the time of the exodus of Israel
out of Egypt, and the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai, we could
expect nothing else than what we actually find in Genesis, namely, that
this name is not used by the author of the book of Genesis before the
call of Abraham, except in connection with such facts as were directly
preparatory to the call of Abraham to be the father of the covenant
nation; and that even in the history of the patriarchs, in which it
predominates from Gen. 12–16, it is used less frequently again after
Jehovah revealed Himself to Abraham as El Shaddai, and other titles of
God sprang out of the continued manifestations of God to the patriarchs,
which could take the place of that name. (For more detailed remarks, see
pp. 213ff.).

It would not have been by any means strange, therefore, if the name
Jehovah had not occurred at all in the account of the creation of the
world, in the genealogies of the patriarchs of the primeval and
preparatory age (Gen. 5 and 11), in the table of nations (Gen. 10), in
the account of the negotiations of Abraham with the Hittites concerning
the purchase of the cave of Machpelah for a family sepulchre (Gen. 23),
in the notices respecting Esau and the Edomitish tribe-princes and kings
(Gen. 36), and other narratives of similar import. Nevertheless we find
it in the genealogy in Gen. 5:29, and in the table of nations in Gen.
10:9, where the critics, in order to save their hypothesis, are obliged
to have recourse to an assumption of glosses, or editorial revisions.
They have dealt still more violently with Gen. 17:1. There Jehovah
appears to Abram, and manifests Himself to him as El Shaddai, from which
it is very evident that the name El Shaddai simply expresses one
particular feature in the manifestation of Jehovah, and describes a
preliminary stage, anticipatory of the full development of the nature of
the absolute God, as expressed in the name Jehovah.

This is put beyond all doubt by the declaration of God to Moses in Ex.
6:3, “I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as El Shaddai, and by My
name Jehovah was I not known to them.” Even Astruc observes, with
reference to these words, “The passage in exodus, when properly
understood, does not prove that the name of Jehovah was a name of God
unknown to the patriarchs, and revealed for the first time to Moses; it
simply proves that God had not shown the patriarchs the full extent of
the meaning of this name, as He had made it known to Moses.” The modern
critics, on the other hand, have erased Jehovah from the text in Gen.
17:1, and substituted Elohim in its place, and then declare El Shaddai
synonymous with Elohim, whilst they have so perverted Ex. 6:3 as to make
the name Jehovah utterly unknown to the patriarchs.

By similar acts of violence they have mangled the text in very many
other passages, for the purpose of carrying out the distinction between
the Elohim and Jehovah documents; and yet for all that they cannot
escape the admission, that there are certain portions or sections of the
book of Genesis in which the separation is impossible.

It is just the same with the supposed “favourite expressions” of the
Elohistic and Jehovistic sections, as with the names of God. “There are
certain favourite expressions, it is said, which are common to the
Elohistic portions; and the same things are frequently called by
different names in the Elohistic and Jehovistic sections. Among the
Elohistic expressions are: אֲחֻזָּה (possession), אֶרֶץ מְגוּרִים (land
of the stranger’s sojourn), לְדֹרֹותֵיכֶם, לְמִינֹו, בְּעֶצֶם הַיֹּום
הַזֶּה (the self-same day), Padan-Aram (the Jehovistic for this is
always (?) Aram-Naharaim, or simply Aram),40 פָּרָה וְרָבָה, הֵקִים
בְּרִית (the Jehovistic is כָּרַת בְּרִית); wherever the name Elohim
occurs, these expressions also appear as its inseparable satellites.”

This statement is in part incorrect, and not in accordance with fact;
and even where there is any foundation for it, it really proves nothing.
In the first place, it is not correct that אֲחֻזָּה and אֶרֶץ מְגוּרִים
are only to be met with in Elohistic portions. In the very first passage
in which we meet with this word in the Pentateuch (Gen. 17:8), it is not
Elohim, but Jehovah, who appears as El Shaddai, and promises Abraham and
his seed the land of his pilgrimage, the land of Canaan, לַאֲחֻזַּת
עֹולָם. This passage is clearly pointed to in Gen. 48:4. In addition to
this, the word achuzzah occurs in Gen. 23:4, 9, 20; 49:30; 50:13, in
connection with the family sepulchre which Abraham had acquired as a
possession by purchase; also in the laws concerning the sale and
redemption of landed property (Lev. 25 and 27 very frequently), and in
those concerning the division of the land as a possession among the
tribes and families of Israel (Num. 27:7; 32:5ff., 35:2, 8); also in
Lev. 25:34 and Gen. 36:43, —in both passages with reference to property
or a fixed landed possession, for which there was no other word in the
Hebrew language that could be used in these passages; not to mention the
fact, that Stähelin, Knobel, and others, pronounce Num. 32:32 a
Jehovistic passage.

So again the expressions הֵקִים בְּרִית (to set up a covenant) and
לְדֹרֹתָם (in their generations) occur in Gen. 17:7 in a Jehovistic
framework; for it was not Elohim, but Jehovah, who appeared to Abram
(see v. 1), to set up (not conclude) His covenant with him and his
posterity as an everlasting covenant, according to their generations. To
set up (i.e., realize, carry out) a covenant, and to conclude a
covenant, are certainly two distinct ideas.

In Gen. 47:27, again, and Lev. 26:9, we meet with פָּרָה וְרָבָה in two
sections, which are pronounced Jehovistic. The other three, no doubt,
occur in Genesis in connection with Elohim; but the expression, “in the
self-same day,” could not be expected in Jehovistic sections, for the
simple reason, that the time of the revelations and promises of God is
not generally reckoned by day and hour. “After his kind” is only met
with in four sections in the whole of the Pentateuch,—in the accounts of
the creation and that of the flood (Gen. 1 and 6–7), and in the laws
concerning clean and unclean beasts (Lev. 11 and Deuteronomy 14), where
it is simply the species of animals that are referred to.

Can this word then be called a favourite Elohistic expression, which
constantly appears like an inseparable satellite, wherever the name
Elohim occurs? The same remarks apply to other words and phrases
described as Elohistic: e.g., tholedoth (which stands at the head of a
Jehovistic account, however, in Gen. 2:4), “father’s house,” “in their
families” (Mishpachoth), and many others. But just as such expressions
as these are not to be expected in the prophetico-historical sections,
for the simple reason that the ideas which they express belong to a
totally different sphere, so, on the other hand, a considerable number
of notions and words, which are associated with the visible
manifestations of God, the promises to the patriarchs, their worship,
etc., are found in the book of Genesis always in connection with the
name Jehovah: see, for example, קָרָא בְשֵׁם יְהֹוָה, (עֹלֹות) הֶעֱלָה
עֹולָה, רֵיחַ הַנִּחֹחַ, and others of the same kind.

And yet the last two occur in the laws of the middle books, which the
critics attribute to the Elohist much more frequently than many of the
so-called Elohistic expressions and formulas of the book of Genesis.
This fact clearly shows, that there are no such things as favourite
expressions of the Elohist and Jehovist, but that the words are always
adapted to the subject. In the covenant statutes of the middle books, we
find Elohistic and Jehovistic expressions combined, because the economy
of the Sinaitic covenant was anticipated on the one hand by the
patriarchal revelations of Jehovah the covenant God, and established on
the other hand upon the natural foundations of the Israelitish
commonwealth.

The covenant which Jehovah concluded with the people of Israel at Sinai
(Ex. 24) was simply the setting up and full realization of the covenant
which He made with Abram (Gen. 15), and had already begun to set up with
him by the promise of a son, and the institution of circumcision as the
covenant sign (Gen. 17).

The indispensable condition of membership in the covenant was
circumcision, which Jehovah commanded to Abraham when He made Himself
known to him as El Shaddai (Gen. 17), and in connection with which we
meet for the first time with the legal formulas, “a statute for ever,”
“in your generations,” and “that soul shall be cut off,” which recur so
constantly in the covenant statutes of the middle books, but so
arranged, that the expression “a statute for ever” is never used in
connection with general religious precepts or purely moral commandments,
the eternal significance of which did not need to be enjoined, since it
naturally followed from the unchangeable holiness and justice of the
eternal God whilst this could not be assumed without further ground of
the statutory laws and ordinances of the covenant.

But these covenant ordinances also had their roots in the natural order
of the world and of the national life. The nation of Israel which sprang
from the twelve sons of Israel by natural generation, received its
division into tribes, and the constitution founded upon this, as a
covenant nation and congregation of Jehovah. The numbering of the people
was taken in tribes, according to the families and fathers’ houses of
the different tribes; and the land of Canaan, which was promised them
for an inheritance, was to be divided among the tribes, with special
reference to the number and magnitude of their families. It is perfectly
natural, therefore, that in the laws and statements concerning these
things, words and formularies should be repeated which already occur in
the book of Genesis in connection with the genealogical notices.

Modern critics, as is well known, regard the whole of the Sinaitic
legislation, from Ex. 25 to Num. 10:28, as an essential part of the
original work, with the exception of Ex. 20–23, Lev. 17–20 and 26, and a
few verses in Lev. 10, 23, 24, 25, and Num. 4 and 8. Now, as a great
variety of things are noticed in this law—such as the building and
setting up of the tabernacle, the description of the priests’ clothes,
the order of sacrifice—which are not mentioned again in the other parts
of the Pentateuch, it was very easy for Knobel to fill several pages
with expressions from the original Elohistic work, which are neither to
be found in the Jehovistic historical narratives, nor in the general
commands of a religious and moral character, by simply collecting
together all the names of these particular things.

But what does such a collection prove? Nothing further than that the
contents of the Pentateuch are very varied, and the same things are not
repeated throughout. Could we expect to find beams, pillars, coverings,
tapestries, and the vessels of the sanctuary, or priests’ dresses and
sacrificial objects, mentioned in the ten commandments, or among the
rights of Israel (Ex. 20–23), or in the laws of marriage and chastity
and the moral commandments (Lev. 17–20)? With the exception of the
absence of certain expressions and formulas, which are of frequent
occurrence in the covenant statutes, the critics are unable to adduce
any other ground for excluding the general religious and moral
commandments from the legislation of the so-called original work, than
the a priori axiom, “The Elohist had respect simply to the theocratic
law; and such laws as are introduced in Ex. 21–23, in connection with
moral and civil life, lay altogether outside his plan.” These are
assertions, not proofs.

The use of words in the Pentateuch could only furnish conclusive
evidence that it had been composed by various authors, if the assertion
were a well founded one, that different expressions are employed for the
same things in different parts of the work But all that has hitherto
been adduced in proof of this amounts to nothing more than a few words,
chiefly in the early chapters of Genesis; whilst it is assumed at the
same time that Gen. 2:4ff. contains a second account of the creation,
whereas it simply gives a description of paradise, and a more minute
account of the creation of man than is to be found in Gen. 1, the
difference in point of view requiring different words.

To this we have to add the fact, that by no means a small number of
sections exhibit, so far as the language is concerned, the peculiarities
of the two original documents or main sources, and render a division
utterly impossible.

The critics have therefore found themselves compelled to assume that
there was a third or even a fourth source, to which they refer whatever
cannot be assigned to the other two. This assumption is a pure offshoot
of critical difficulty, whilst the fact itself is a proof that the
Pentateuch is founded upon unity of language, and that the differences
which occur here and there arise for the most part from the variety and
diversity of the actual contents; whilst in a very few instances they
may be attributable to the fact that Moses availed himself of existing
writings in the composition of the book of Genesis, and in the middle
books inserted public documents without alteration in his historical
account.

The other proofs adduced, for the purpose of supporting the evidence
from language, viz., the frequent repetitions of the same thing and the
actual discrepancies, are even weaker still. No doubt the Pentateuch
abounds in repetitions.

The longest and most important is the description of the tabernacle,
where we have, first of all, the command to prepare this sanctuary given
in Ex. 25–31, with a detailed description of all the different parts,
and all the articles of furniture, as well as of the priests’ clothing
and the consecration of the priests and the altar; and then again, in
Ex. 35–39 and Lev. 8, a detailed account of the fulfilment of these
instructions in almost the same words.

The holy candlestick is mentioned five times (Ex. 25:31–40; 27:20, 21;
30:7, 8, Lev. 24:1–4, and Num. 8:1–4); the command not to eat blood
occurs as many as eight times (Gen. 9:4; Lev. 3:17; 7:26, 27; 17:10–14;
Deuteronomy 12:16, 23, 24, and 15:23), and on the first three occasions,
at all events, in passages belonging to the so-called original work.

Now, if these repetitions have not been regarded by any of the critics,
with the exception of J. Popper, as furnishing proofs of difference of
authorship, what right can we have to adduce other repetitions of a
similar kind as possessing any such significance?—But lastly, the
critics have involved themselves in almost incomprehensible
contradictions, through the supposed contradictions in the Pentateuch.

Some of them, e.g., Stähelin and Bertheau, think these discrepancies
only apparent, or at least as of such a character that the last editor
saw no discrepancies in them, otherwise he would have expunged them.
Others, such as Knobel and Hupfeld, place them in the foreground, as the
main proofs of a plurality of authors; whilst Hupfeld especially, by a
truly inquisitorial process, has made even the smallest differences into
irreconcilable contradictions.

Yet, for all that, he maintains that the Pentateuch, in its present
form, is a work characterized by unity, arranged and carried out
according to a definite plan, in which the different portions are so
arranged and connected together, “with an intelligent regard to
connection and unity or plan,” yea, “dovetailed together in so
harmonious a way, that they have the deceptive appearance of a united
whole” (Hupfeld, die Quellen der Genes. p. 196).

In working up the different sources, the editor, it is said, “did not
hesitate to make systematic corrections of the one to bring it into
harmony with the other,” as, for example, in the names Abram and Sarai,
which he copied from the original document into the Jehovistic portions
before Gen. 17, because “he would not allow of any discrepancy between
his sources in these points, and in fact could not have allowed it
without a manifest contradiction, and the consequent confusion of his
readers” (p. 198).

How then does it square with so intelligent a procedure, to assume that
there are irreconcilable contradictions in the work? An editor who
worked with so much intelligence and reflection would never have left
actual contradictions standing; and modern critics have been able to
discover them simply because they judge the biblical writings according
to modern notions, and start in their operations from a fundamental
opinion which is directly at variance with the revelation of the Bible.

The strength of the opposition to the unity and Mosaic authorship of the
Pentateuch arises much less from the peculiarities of form, which the
critics have placed in the foreground, than from the offence which they
take at the contents of the books of Moses, which are irreconcilable
with the naturalism of the modern views of the world.

To the leaders of modern criticism, not only is the spuriousness, or
post-Mosaic origin of the Pentateuch, an established fact, but the
gradual rise of the Mosaic laws in connection with the natural
development of the Hebrew people, without any direct or supernatural
interposition on the part of God, is also firmly established a priori on
dogmatical grounds. This is openly expressed by De Wette in the three
first editions of his Introduction, in which he opens the critical
inquiry concerning the Pentateuch with this observation (§ 145): “Many
occurrences are opposed to the laws of nature, and presuppose a direct
interposition on the part of God;” and then proceeds to say, that “if to
an educated mind it is a decided fact that such miracles have never
really occurred, the question arises whether, perhaps, they may have
appeared to do so to the eye-witnesses and persons immediately
concerned; but to this also we must give a negative reply.

And thus we are brought to the conclusion that the narrative is not
contemporaneous, or derived from contemporaneous sources.” Ewald has
expressed his naturalistic views, which acknowledge no supernatural
revelation from God, in his “History of the People of Israel,” and
developed the gradual formation of the Pentateuch from the principles
involved in these fundamental views.

But just as De Wette expressed this candid confession in a much more
cautious and disguised manner in the later editions of his Introduction,
so have his successors endeavoured more and more to conceal the
naturalistic background of their critical operations, and restricted
themselves to arguments, the weakness and worthlessness of which they
themselves admit in connection with critical questions which do not
affect their naturalistic views.

So long as biblical criticism is fettered by naturalism, it will never
rise to a recognition of the genuineness and internal unity of the
Pentateuch.

For if the miraculous acts of the living God recorded in it are not
true, and did not actually occur, the account of them cannot have come
down from eye-witnesses, but can only be myths, which grew up in the
popular belief long after the events referred to.

And if there is no prophetic foresight of the future produced by the
Spirit of God, Moses cannot have foretold the rejection of Israel and
their dispersion among the heathen even before their entrance into
Canaan, whereas they did not take place till many centuries afterwards.

If, on the other hand, the reality of the supernatural revelations of
God, together with miracles and prophecies, be admitted, not only are
the contents of the Pentateuch in harmony with its Mosaic authorship,
but even its formal arrangement can be understood and scientifically
vindicated, provided only we suppose the work to have originated in the
following manner.

After the exodus of the tribes of Israel from Egypt, and their adoption
as the people of Jehovah through the conclusion of the covenant at
Sinai, when Moses had been commanded by God to write down the covenant
rights (Ex. 24:4, and 34:27), and then formed the resolution not only to
ensure the laws which the Lord had given to the people through his
mediation against alteration and distortion, and hand them down to
futurity by committing them to writing, but to write down all the great
and glorious things that the Lord had done for His people, for the
instruction of his own and succeeding generations, and set himself to
carry out this resolution; he collected together the traditions of the
olden time, which had been handed down in Israel from the days of the
patriarchs, partly orally, and partly in writings and records, for the
purpose of combining them into a preliminary history of the kingdom of
God, which was founded by the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai.

Accordingly, in all probability during the stay at Sinai, in the five or
six months which were occupied in building the tabernacle, he wrote not
only the book of Genesis, but the history of the deliverance of Israel
out of Egypt and the march to Sinai (Ex. 19), to which the decalogue,
with the book of the covenant (Ex. 20–23), is attached, according to
that plan of the kingdom of God which had then been fully revealed, or,
in other words, from a theocratic point of view.

As he had written the covenant rights in a book by the command of God,
as a preliminary to the conclusion of the covenant itself (Ex. 24:4),
there can be no doubt whatever that he did not merely publish to the
people by word of mouth the very elaborate revelation and directions of
God concerning the construction of the tabernacle and the apparatus of
worship, which he had received upon the mountain (Ex. 25–31), as well as
all the rest of the laws, but either committed them to writing himself
directly after he had received them from the Lord, or had them written
out by one of his assistants, and collected together for the purpose of
forming them eventually into a complete work.

We may make the same assumption with reference to the most important
events which occurred during the forty years’ journey through the
desert, so that, on the arrival of the camp in the steppes of Moab, the
whole of the historical and legal materials for the three middle books
of the Pentateuch were already collected together, and all that remained
to be done was to form them into a united whole, and give them a final
revision.

The collection, arrangement, and final working up of these materials
would be accomplished in a very short time, since Moses had, at all
events, the priests and shoterim by his side.—All this had probably
taken place before the last addresses of Moses, which compose the book
of Deuteronomy, so that nothing further remained to be done but to write
down these addresses, and append them as a fifth book to the four
already in existence. With this the writing of “all the words of this
book of the law” was finished, so that the whole book of the law could
be handed over in a complete state to the priests, to be properly taken
care of by them (Deuteronomy 31:24ff.).

A copy of the song of Moses was added to this written work, in all
probability immediately after it had been deposited by the side of the
ark of the covenant; and, after his death, the blessing pronounced upon
the tribes before his departure was also committed to writing. Finally,
after the conquest of Canaan, possibly on the renewal of the covenant
under Joshua, an account of the death of Moses was added to these last
two testimonies of the man of God, and adopted along with them, in the
form of an appendix, into his book of the law.
