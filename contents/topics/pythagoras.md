Born: about 569 BC in Samos, Ionia

Died: about 475 BC

Pythagoras of Samos is often described as the first pure mathematician.
He is an extremely important figure in the development of mathematics
yet we know relatively little about his mathematical achievements.
Unlike many later Greek mathematicians, where at least we have some of
the books which they wrote, we have nothing of Pythagoras’s writings.
The society which he led, half religious and half scientific, followed a
code of secrecy which certainly means that today Pythagoras is a
mysterious figure.

We do have details of Pythagoras’s life from early biographies which use
important original sources yet are written by authors who attribute
divine powers to him, and whose aim was to present him as a god-like
figure. What we present below is an attempt to collect together the most
reliable sources to reconstruct an account of Pythagoras’s life. There
is fairly good agreement on the main events of his life but most of the
dates are disputed with different scholars giving dates which differ by
20 years. Some historians treat all this information as merely legends
but, even if the reader treats it in this way, being such an early
record it is of historical importance.

Pythagoras’s father was Mnesarchus, while his mother was Pythais and she
was a native of Samos. Mnesarchus was a merchant who came from Tyre, and
there is a story that he brought corn to Samos at a time of famine and
was granted citizenship of Samos as a mark of gratitude. As a child
Pythagoras spent his early years in Samos but traveled widely with his
father. There are accounts of Mnesarchus returning to Tyre with
Pythagoras and that he was taught there by the Chaldeans and the learned
men of Syria. It seems that he also visited Italy with his father.

Little is known of Pythagoras’s childhood. All accounts of his physical
appearance are likely to be fictitious except the description of a
striking birthmark which Pythagoras had on his thigh. It is probable
that he had two brothers although some sources say that he had three.
Certainly he was well educated, learning to play the lyre, learning
poetry and to recite Homer. There were, among his teachers, three
philosophers who were to influence Pythagoras while he was a young man.
One of the most important was Pherekydes who many describe as the
teacher of Pythagoras.

The other two philosophers who were to influence Pythagoras, and to
introduce him to mathematical ideas, were Thales and his pupil
Anaximander who both lived on Miletus. In it is said that Pythagoras
visited Thales in Miletus when he was between 18 and 20 years old. By
this time Thales was an old man and, although he created a strong
impression on Pythagoras, he probably did not teach him a great deal.
However he did contribute to Pythagoras’s interest in mathematics and
astronomy, and advised him to travel to Egypt to learn more of these
subjects. Thales’s pupil, Anaximander, lectured on Miletus and
Pythagoras attended these lectures. Anaximander certainly was interested
in geometry and cosmology and many of his ideas would influence
Pythagoras’s own views.

In about 535 BC Pythagoras went to Egypt. This happened a few years
after the tyrant Polycrates seized control of the city of Samos. There
is some evidence to suggest that Pythagoras and Polycrates were friendly
at first and it is claimed that Pythagoras went to Egypt with a letter
of introduction written by Polycrates. In fact Polycrates had an
alliance with Egypt and there were therefore strong links between Samos
and Egypt at this time. The accounts of Pythagoras’s time in Egypt
suggest that he visited many of the temples and took part in many
discussions with the priests. According to Porphyry ([12] and [13])
Pythagoras was refused admission to all the temples except the one at
Diospolis where he was accepted into the priesthood after completing the
rites necessary for admission.

It is not difficult to relate many of Pythagoras’s beliefs, ones he
would later impose on the society that he set up in Italy, to the
customs that he came across in Egypt. For example the secrecy of the
Egyptian priests, their refusal to eat beans, their refusal to wear even
cloths made from animal skins, and their striving for purity were all
customs that Pythagoras would later adopt. Porphyry in [12] and [13]
says that Pythagoras learnt geometry from the Egyptians but it is likely
that he was already acquainted with geometry, certainly after teachings
from Thales and Anaximander.

In 525 BC Cambyses II, the king of Persia, invaded Egypt. Polycrates
abandoned his alliance with Egypt and sent 40 ships to join the Persian
fleet against the Egyptians. After Cambyses had won the Battle of
Pelusium in the Nile Delta and had captured Heliopolis and Memphis,
Egyptian resistance collapsed. Pythagoras was taken prisoner and taken
to Babylon. Iamblichus writes that Pythagoras was transported by the
followers of Cambyses as a prisoner of war. Whilst he was there he
gladly associated with the Magi and was instructed in their sacred rites
and learnt about a very mystical worship of the gods. He also reached
the acme of perfection in arithmetic and music and the other
mathematical sciences taught by the Babylonians.

In about 520 BC Pythagoras left Babylon and returned to Samos.
Polycrates had been killed in about 522 BC and Cambyses died in the
summer of 522 BC, either by committing suicide or as the result of an
accident. The deaths of these rulers may have been a factor in
Pythagoras’s return to Samos but it is nowhere explained how Pythagoras
obtained his freedom. Darius of Persia had taken control of Samos after
Polycrates’ death and he would have controlled the island on
Pythagoras’s return. This conflicts with the accounts of Porphyry and
Diogenes Laertius who state that Polycrates was still in control of
Samos when Pythagoras returned there.

Pythagoras made a journey to Crete shortly after his return to Samos to
study the system of laws there. Back in Samos he founded a school which
was called the semicircle. Iamblichus writes in the third century AD
that he formed a school in the city [of Samos], the ‘semicircle’ of
Pythagoras, which is known by that name even today, in which the Samians
hold political meetings. They do this because they think one should
discuss questions about goodness, justice and expediency in this place
which was founded by the man who made all these subjects his business.
Outside the city he made a cave the private site of his own
philosophical teaching, spending most of the night and daytime there and
doing research into the uses of mathematics.

Pythagoras left Samos and went to southern Italy in about 518 BC (some
say much earlier). Iamblichus gives some reasons for him leaving. First
he comments on the Samian response to his teaching methods he tried to
use his symbolic method of teaching which was similar in all respects to
the lessons he had learnt in Egypt. The Samians were not very keen on
this method and treated him in a rude and improper manner.

This was, according to Iamblichus, used in part as an excuse for
Pythagoras to leave Samos Pythagoras was dragged into all sorts of
diplomatic missions by his fellow citizens and forced to participate in
public affairs. He knew that all the philosophers before him had ended
their days on foreign soil so he decided to escape all political
responsibility, alleging as his excuse, according to some sources, the
contempt the Samians had for his teaching method.

Pythagoras founded a philosophical and religious school in Croton (now
Crotone, on the east of the heal of southern Italy) that had many
followers. Pythagoras was the head of the society with an inner circle
of followers known as **mathematikoi**. The mathematikoi lived
permanently with the Society, had no personal possessions and were
vegetarians. They were taught by Pythagoras himself and obeyed strict
rules. The beliefs that Pythagoras held were

(1) that at its deepest level, reality is mathematical in nature,

(2) that philosophy can be used for spiritual purification,

(3) that the soul can rise to union with the divine,

(4) that certain symbols have a mystical significance, and

(5) that all brothers of the order should observe strict loyalty and
secrecy.

Both men and women were permitted to become members of the Society, in
fact several later women Pythagoreans became famous philosophers. The
outer circle of the Society were known as the **akousmatics** and they
lived in their own houses, only coming to the Society during the day.
They were allowed their own possessions and were not required to be
vegetarians.

Of Pythagoras’s actual work nothing is known. His school practiced
secrecy and communalism making it hard to distinguish between the work
of Pythagoras and that of his followers. Certainly his school made
outstanding contributions to mathematics, and it is possible to be
fairly certain about some of Pythagoras’s mathematical contributions.
First we should be clear in what sense Pythagoras and the mathematikoi
were studying mathematics. They were not acting as a mathematics
research group does in a modern university or other institution. There
were no ‘open problems’ for them to solve, and they were not in any
sense interested in trying to formulate or solve mathematical problems.

Rather Pythagoras was interested in the principles of mathematics, the
concept of number, the concept of a triangle or other mathematical
figure and the abstract idea of a proof. As Brumbaugh writes in

It is hard for us today, familiar as we are with pure mathematical
abstraction and with the mental act of generalization, to appreciate the
originality of this Pythagorean contribution.

In fact today we have become so mathematically sophisticated that we
fail even to recognize 2 as an abstract quantity. There is a remarkable
step from 2 ships + 2 ships = 4 ships, to the abstract result 2 + 2 = 4,
which applies not only to ships but to pens, people, houses etc. There
is another step to see that the abstract notion of 2 is itself a thing,
in some sense every bit as real as a ship or a house.

Pythagoras believed that all relations could be reduced to number
relations. As Aristotle wrote

The Pythagorean having been brought up in the study of mathematics,
thought that things are numbers and that the whole cosmos is a scale and
a number.

This generalization stemmed from Pythagoras’s observations in music,
mathematics and astronomy. Pythagoras noticed that vibrating strings
produce harmonious tones when the ratios of the lengths of the strings
are whole numbers, and that these ratios could be extended to other
instruments. In fact Pythagoras made remarkable contributions to the
mathematical theory of music. He was a fine musician, playing the lyre,
and he used music as a means to help those who were ill.

Pythagoras studied properties of numbers which would be familiar to
mathematicians today, such as even and odd numbers, triangular numbers,
perfect numbers etc. However to Pythagoras numbers had personalities
which we hardly recognize as mathematics today

Each number had its own personality - masculine or feminine, perfect or
incomplete, beautiful or ugly. This feeling modern mathematics has
deliberately eliminated, but we still find overtones of it in fiction
and poetry. Ten was the very best number: it contained in itself the
first four integers - one, two, three, and four [1+2+3+4 = 10] - and
these written in dot notation formed a perfect triangle.

Of course today we particularly remember Pythagoras for his famous
geometry theorem. Although the theorem, now known as Pythagoras’s
theorem, was known to the Babylonians 1000 years earlier he may have
been the first to prove it. Proclus, the last major Greek philosopher,
who lived around 450 AD wrote (see )

After [Thales, etc.] Pythagoras transformed the study of geometry into a
liberal education, examining the principles of the science from the
beginning and probing the theorems in an immaterial and intellectual
manner: he it was who discovered the theory of irrationals and the
construction of the cosmic figures.

Again Proclus, writing of geometry, said

I emulate the Pythagoreans who even had a conventional phrase to express
what I mean “a figure and a platform, not a figure and a sixpence”, by
which they implied that the geometry which is deserving of study is that
which, at each new theorem, sets up a platform to ascend by, and lifts
the soul on high instead of allowing it to go down among the sensible
objects and so become subservient to the common needs of this mortal
life.

Heath gives a list of theorems attributed to Pythagoras, or rather more
generally to the Pythagoreans.

(i) The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles.
Also the Pythagoreans knew the generalization which states that a
polygon with n sides has sum of interior angles 2n - 4 right angles and
sum of exterior angles equal to four right angles.

(ii) The theorem of Pythagoras - for a right angled triangle the square
on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two
sides. We should note here that to Pythagoras the square on the
hypotenuse would certainly not be thought of as a number multiplied by
itself, but rather as a geometrical square constructed on the side. To
say that the sum of two squares is equal to a third square meant that
the two squares could be cut up and reassembled to form a square
identical to the third square.

(iii) Constructing figures of a given area and geometrical algebra. For
example they solved equations such as a (a - x) = x2 by geometrical
means.

(iv) The discovery of irrationals. This is certainly attributed to the
Pythagoreans but it does seem unlikely to have been due to Pythagoras
himself. This went against Pythagoras’s philosophy the all things are
numbers, since by a number he meant the ratio of two whole numbers.
However, because of his belief that all things are numbers it would be a
natural task to try to prove that the hypotenuse of an isosceles right
angled triangle had a length corresponding to a number.

(v) The five regular solids. It is thought that Pythagoras himself knew
how to construct the first three but it is unlikely that he would have
known how to construct the other two.

(vi) In astronomy Pythagoras taught that the Earth was a sphere at the
center of the Universe. He also recognized that the orbit of the Moon
was inclined to the equator of the Earth and he was one of the first to
realize that Venus as an evening star was the same planet as Venus as a
morning star.

Primarily, however, Pythagoras was a philosopher. In addition to his
beliefs about numbers, geometry and astronomy described above, he held
the following philosophical and ethical teachings: the dependence of the
dynamics of world structure on the interaction of contraries, or pairs
of opposites; the viewing of the soul as a self-moving number
experiencing a form of metempsychosis, or successive reincarnation in
different species until its eventual purification (particularly through
the intellectual life of the ethically rigorous Pythagoreans); and the
understanding .that all existing objects were fundamentally composed of
form and not of material substance. Further Pythagorean doctrine
identified the brain as the locus of the soul; and prescribed certain
secret cultic practices.

In their practical ethics are also described

In their ethical practices, the Pythagorean were famous for their mutual
friendship, unselfishness, and honesty.

Pythagoras’s Society at Croton was not unaffected by political events
despite his desire to stay out of politics. Pythagoras went to Delos in
513 BC to nurse his old teacher Pherekydes who was dying. He remained
there for a few months until the death of his friend and teacher and
then returned to Croton. In 510 BC Croton attacked and defeated its
neighbor Sybaris and there is certainly some suggestions that Pythagoras
became involved in the dispute. Then in around 508 BC the Pythagorean
Society at Croton was attacked by Cylon, a noble from Croton itself.
Pythagoras escaped to Metapontium and the most authors say he died
there, some claiming that he committed suicide because of the attack on
his Society. Iamblichus in quotes one version of events

Cylon, a Crotoniate and leading citizen by birth, fame and riches, but
otherwise a difficult, violent, disturbing and tyrannically disposed
man, eagerly desired to participate in the Pythagorean way of life. He
approached Pythagoras, then an old man, but was rejected because of the
character defects just described. When this happened Cylon and his
friends vowed to make a strong attack on Pythagoras and his followers.
Thus a powerfully aggressive zeal activated Cylon and his followers to
persecute the Pythagoreans to the very last man. Because of this
Pythagoras left for Metapontium and there is said to have ended his
days.

This seems accepted by most but Iamblichus himself does not accept this
version and argues that the attack by Cylon was a minor affair and that
Pythagoras returned to Croton. Certainly the Pythagorean Society thrived
for many years after this and spread from Croton to many other Italian
cities. Gorman argues that this is a strong reason to believe that
Pythagoras returned to Croton and quotes other evidence such as the
widely reported age of Pythagoras as around 100 at the time of his death
and the fact that many sources say that Pythagoras taught Empedokles to
claim that he must have lived well after 480 BC.

The evidence is unclear as to when and where the death of Pythagoras
occurred. Certainly the Pythagorean Society expanded rapidly after 500
BC, became political in nature and also spilt into a number of factions.
In 460 BC the Society : was violently suppressed. Its meeting houses
were everywhere sacked and burned; mention is made in particular of “the
house of Milo” in Croton, where 50 or 60 Pythagoreans were surprised and
slain. Those who survived took refuge at Thebes and other places.
