Bitterness is one of the most crushing mental problems in a person’s
life. When a Christian is bitter, there is a loss of close fellowship
with the Lord and a hindrance in one’s relationship with the Lord Jesus
Christ. Bitterness causes a loss of many of the blessings of the normal
Christian life, including emotional stability, peace and joy. Bitterness
results in the loss of production of good works like gold, silver and
precious stones which are a major source of blessing and reward in the
plan of God.

Bitterness is a devastating mental attitude sin, and it triggers a wide
range of other sins, such as:

* Hatred Cruelty Antagonism Self-pity Unteachableness or implacability
* Vindictiveness and desires for revenge Prideful ambition or arrogance

Bitterness is neither consistent nor rational. A bitter person is his
own worst enemy. It is very difficult to maintain any kind of
relationship with a chronically bitter person; and bitterness is a major
contributing cause of marital and family problems.

The objective in this short article is to provide Christians with a
thorough look at what the Bible says about bitterness, including many
scripture examples, then to offer some direction about how to have
victory over bitterness.

There are quite a few companion studies in the Grace Notes library which
can help identify the mental attitude sin of bitterness and help deal
with it from divine viewpoint.

##### Definition

In English, the concept of mental bitterness comes from the idea of
something that has a sharp or unpleasant taste. We speak of something
being bitter if it causes grief or is hard to bear; a bitter defeat,
bitter failure. We also speak of a bitter loss when someone’s death has
caused great grief.

Then, bitterness has come to be used of those things that cause pain or
grief, such as bitter remarks or the actions of bitter enemies. We say
“he fought to the bitter end”, meaning a struggle in the last extremity.

The biblical Greek words for bitterness are PIKROS = “bitter” and PIKRIA
= “bitterness”, and other derivatives. PIKROS originally meant “sharp”,
or “pointed”. Then it was used more generally for anything that was
penetrating to the senses, something that had a pervasive smell or a
shrill noise. PIKRIA was used for the bitterness of the taste of some
plants, and finally found use in speaking of personal experience when
something was unpleasant, undesirable, or when something bad was
unexpected.

The words PIKROS or PIKRIA are used about 40 times in the Septuagint
(Greek translation of the Old Testament), only rarely to refer to
literal bitterness, such as the reference to bitter water in Exo. 15:23.
Usually it is a reference to men who are (pikroi) the bitter ones when
they are soured or cruel (Ruth 1:20; Hab. 1:6).

There are seven instances of these words in the New Testament: Matt.
26:75; Luke 22:62; Acts 8:23; Rom. 3:14; Eph. 4:31; James 3:11, 14.

So, in the Bible, except when it is obvious that the actual taste of
something in meant, _*PIKRIA refers to intensity of suffering of mind
and body, something that is difficult to bear, something that causes
animosity and reaction, something that is brought about by hatred or
antagonism*_.

##### Bible Examples of Bitterness

* Women are bitter because they cannot have children, 1 Sam 1:10.

* A foolish son is bitterness to his mother, Prov. 17:25.

* Divine discipline or chastisement of the Jewish people caused
  bitterness. This demonstrates the weakness and failure of the people.
  Bitterness destroyed the people’s spiritual lives. The Jews brought on
  self-destruction by their bitterness.

* Lam. 1:4; Amos 8:10; Ezek. 27:30; Isa. 33:7; 2 Kings 14:26.

* Slavery causes bitterness, Exo. 1:14.

* Suffering causes bitterness to people who do not understand the
  Bible’s problem solving devices and principles, and who do not give
  number one priority to their relationship with God. Deut. 32:24.

* Ridicule is a source of bitterness, Lam 3:14. The people ridiculed
  Jeremiah because of their bitterness toward him. When truth is taught,
  people sometimes react in bitterness.

* Consummate human pride is a cause of bitterness, Acts 8:23.

* Degeneracy is a source of bitterness, Rom. 3:14.

* Personal choice is a source of bitterness, Eph. 4:31.

* Husbands and wives are a source of bitterness toward each other, Col
  3:19.

##### The Results of Bitterness

* Bitterness is antisocial. A bitter person is selfish, inconsiderate of
  others, withdrawn from society, indifferent or adverse to conformity
  with conventional standards of social behavior. Even strangers avoid
  bitter people, Prov. 14:10. No one is happy around bitter people.

* Bitterness is a sign of the spiritual life gone wrong, Jer. 2:19.

* A bitter person rejects Bible teaching. James 3:14, “_But if you have
  bitter jealousy and strife, stop being arrogant and lying against the
  truth._”

* Bitterness shows total lack of grace orientation. A bitter person does
  not understand the plan of God, let alone how it affects individuals.
* In Job 9:17-18, Job’s complaint against God, "Why does God let this
  happen to me?," is a statement of bitterness.

* Bitterness accompanies the sin unto death, Job 21:25.

* Bitterness motivates complaining, Job 7:11, 10:1. People who
  habitually complain are bitter people; they have no self esteem.

* Bitterness motivates gossip, Psalm 64:3.

* Bitterness fragments other peoples lives. Heb 12:15, “_See to it that
  no one comes short of the grace of God and that no root of bitterness
  springing up cause trouble, and by it many be defiled;_”

* Bitterness is self induced misery, and it produces chain sinning.
* Bitterness is misery to others in the periphery. But two wrongs never
  make a right. You cannot build your happiness on someone else’s
  unhappiness.

##### Recovery from Bitterness

> Isa. 38:17, “Behold, bitterness became deliverance to me. In Your love
> You have delivered my soul out of the pit of destruction; for You have
> cast all my sins behind my back.”

Ephesians 1:8 tells us that we have available to us wisdom and prudence
which are part of God’s grace provision for us. Wisdom comes with a
thorough understanding of Bible doctrine and the principles of Christian
living. Prudence is the practical use of applied Bible truth in making
decisions and solving problems in this life.

You can use the following practical methods to deal with bitterness in
your life, regardless of the cause.

Many of these topics are discussed in considerably more detail in other
Grace Notes articles, but this outline will give you ideas on how you
can make specific application of doctrine to help with real world
problems.

##### Confession of Sin

Personal sin leads to bitterness. You must deal with sin on a daily
basis by confessing and moving on. If you do not do this, sin becomes a
burden which clouds your joy, drains your spiritual energy and destroys
your productivity and vitality. In short, sin is always depressing.

1 John 1:9 states that when you confess your sins, God “_is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness._”

In privacy, make a list of your mental attitude sins, verbal sins, and
behavior sins. Ask the Lord to make you aware of the habits of your own
life. Respond immediately to the Holy Spirit when He uses the word to
spotlight your sin. Name the sin to God; then rejoice in forgiveness and
cleansing and your renewed fellowship with God. All the promises and
provisions of God the Father are now available to you. Make it a
spiritual habit to confess sins whenever they show up in your life.

##### The Filling of the Holy Spirit

When you have unconfessed sin in your life, the Holy Spirit is grieved
or quenched. But the Holy Spirit fills you and controls your life when
you have no unconfessed sin in your life. This is why confession of sins
is so important.

You can trust the Holy Spirit to reveal sin to you when you commit it,
or even before. When the Holy Spirit is in control, He produces His
fruit (Gal. 5:22). The fruit of the Spirit does not include heaviness,
bitterness, discouragement, disillusion, anguish, sadness, dejection or
loss of productivity. Consider these points:

* Love is free from bitterness.
* Joy pushes bitterness out.
* Bitterness can not coexist with peace in the soul of the believer
  filled with the Holy spirit.
* Long suffering gives the ability to deal with bitterness and other
  troubles.
* Gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance are fruits of
* righteousness, which is divine good. Divine good takes the place of
  bitterness.

##### Living in the Word

By constant study and meditation in the Bible you are constantly
reminded of God’s viewpoint, of His plan, of His provision, or His
awareness of our spirit of bitterness and what He want to accomplish in
us. Living in the sphere of human viewpoint is a source of bitterness.
Living in the word gradually transplants you to a new sphere, a new
environment for your life, in which there is victory over bitterness.

Furthermore, there is a continuous cleansing taking placed. See
especially Ephesians 5 for how the Lord Jesus uses the word to cleanse
believers.

##### Orientation to Grace

Bitterness is often caused by people, most of the time by people we
cannot escape, or people we love, or people we cannot confront, or
people we trust. Grace orientation includes the ability to look at
people and see them as God sees them. It includes the ability to let
them live their lives as unto the Lord, and trusting God to make His way
clear to them. This technique lets people make mistakes without your
judging them. It enables you to accept criticism without hurt or
bitterness. It enables you to esteem others better than yourself, to do
nothing through strife or vainglory.

##### Occupation with Christ

The technique of occupation with Christ helps to cure bitterness because
it gets your eyes off your spouse, your children, your neighbors, your
friends and yourself. Instead, as you move through the day, you are
thinking about the Lord Jesus Christ, His plan for your life, the
Father’s provision for each incident in your life, and His provision of
wisdom for each decision you must make. Occupation with Christ is a
by-product of the Faith rest Life. Bitterness is a by product of
occupation with self, with life, with problems.

##### The Faith-Rest Life or Trusting God and Enjoying the Peace which Results

Faith rest is believing the promises of God and then entering into the
rest phase of Christian living by claiming and enjoying those promises.
Therefore, you must search the scriptures daily to remind yourself of
promises, and to learn new ones. You must know who and what God is so
that you will not hesitate to believe that He can do what He has
promised to do. Study the attributes of God using verses about the
essence of God. Know Him as He reveals Himself in the Bible. Believe Him
when He tells you what He will do for you. Count on it. Let your faith
rest on it. Cast your burden on the Lord.

##### Relaxed Mental Attitude

A relaxed mental attitude is based on knowing God and on having the
divine production in the soul that comes with the fruit of the Holy
Spirit. A relaxed mental attitude is one of the results of living in the
word, Walking in fellowship, practicing the faith rest life, and being
occupied with Christ.
