This paper is a brief study of the Biblical doctrines of
reconciliation and propitiation, which are vitally important
to a Christian’s understanding of how God has made it
possible for any person to have a good relationship with
Him. Jesus Christ, by bearing our sins on the cross,
fulfilled God’s requirements for a perfect sacrifice; and
the effect was to remove all impediments to our receiving
eternal life and having fellowship with God.

##Reconciliation

The word reconciliation refers to the process of changing
something thoroughly and adjusting it to something else that
is a standard. For example, when you adjust your watch to a
time signal, you are reconciling the watch to a time
standard. When you reconcile your checkbook, the standard to
which you match it is the bank’s record of your account. On
rare occasions the bank must reconcile its accounts to
yours.

In the Bible, reconciliation is the word used to refer to
the process by which God changes human beings and adjusts
them to the standard of His perfect character. Rom. 11:15
refers to the “reconciling of the world”. The Greek word
used here is the noun καταλλαγη (**katallagei**). This word
is also used in Rom. 5:11, “…but we also joy in God through
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
reconciliation._” Note that man is not active in
reconciliation and provides nothing toward reconciliation.
Read also 2 Cor. 5:17-21.

Reconciliation also appears in the verb form καταλλασσω
(**katallasso**), meaning “to reconcile”. It is used in the
active voice in 2 Cor. 5:18 with the meaning of “reconciling
someone to someone else.” In this case, God reconciles us to
Himself, through the Lord Jesus Christ. This verb in the
passive voice means “to be reconciled” or “to become
reconciled”, and it is used in the case of man’s
relationship to God in Rom. 5:10 and 2 Cor. 5:20. The
passive voice is also used in cases of reconciliation
between people, as in 1 Cor. 7:11 and Matt. 5:24.

Another Greek word translated “to reconcile” is ιλασκοµαι
(**hilaskomai**), meaning “to reconcile” in the sense of
providing propitiation, as in Luke 18:13. It is used of the
activity of the Lord Jesus Christ as High Priest in making
reconciliation for His people, Heb. 2:17.

Rom. 5:6-11 points out that the whole world needs to be
reconciled to God. Note the adjectives in this passage which
stress this need: “ungodly”, “without strength”, “sinners”
and “enemies”.

Reconciliation is an important consideration in the study of
the doctrine of the barrier. By the death of Christ on the
cross, the world is thoroughly changed in its relationship
to God, Eph. 2:14-18 and Col. 1:20-22. That is, through the
cross of Christ the world is so altered in its position
respecting the character and judgment of God that God does
not now impute sin to human beings. The world is therefore
rendered savable!

Because the position of the world before God is completely
changed through the substitutionary atonement of Christ,
God’s attitude toward man can no longer be the same. God can
now deal with souls in the light of Christ’s work.

Notice that God is never said to be reconciled to man. God
is immutable, so He does not change. Reconciliation is only
possible in one direction. What sometimes seems to be a
change in God is actually an unchanged attitude of God
viewing a reconciled man. God, having how accepted Christ’s
work, is able to continue to be just toward man. He can now
offer salvation.

A person profits from reconciliation by faith in the Gospel
of Jesus Christ. Once he becomes a believer, a person can
partake in all of the blessings which accompany his position
in Christ, including the privileges accruing from
reconciliation.

The believer, in turn, has the responsibility of becoming a
minister of reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5:18–19. The truth of
reconciliation is one of the key salvation doctrines to be
used in witnessing to those without Christ.

##Propitiation

Propitiation is the work of the Lord Jesus Christ by which
He appeases the wrath of God and conciliates Him who would
otherwise be offended by our sin and would demand that we
pay the penalty for it.

Propitiation is translated from the Greek 'ιλαστεριον
(**hilasterion**), meaning “that which expiates or
propitiates” or “the gift which procures propitiation”. The
word is also used in the New Testament for the place of
propitiation, the “mercy seat”. Heb. 9:5. There is frequent
similar use of **hilasterion** in the Septuagint. Ex. 25:18
ff. The mercy seat was sprinkled with atoning blood on the
day of atonement (Lev. 16:14), representing that the
righteous sentence of the Law had been executed, changing a
judgment seat into a mercy seat (Heb. 9:11-15; compare with
“throne of grace” in Heb. 4:14-16; place of communion, Ex.
25:21-22).

Another Greek word, 'ιλασµος (**hilasmos**), is used for
Christ as our propitiation. 1 John 2:2; 4:10, and for
“atonement” in the Septuagint (Lev. 25:9). The thought in
the Old Testament sacrifices and in the New Testament
fulfillment is that Christ completely satisfied the just
demands of a holy God for judgment on sin by His death on
the cross.

God, foreseeing the cross, is declared righteous in
forgiving sins in the Old Testament period as well as in
justifying sinners under the new covenant (Rom. 3:25, 26;
cf. Ex. 29:33, note). Propitiation is not the placating of a
vengeful God but, rather, it is the satisfying the
righteousness of a holy God, thereby making it possible for
Him to show mercy without compromising His righteousness or
justice.

The Hebrew **kaphar**, means “to propitiate, to atone for
sin”..  According to scripture, the sacrifice required by
the Law only covered the individual’s sin making the sin
offering and secured personal divine forgiveness. The Old
Testament sacrifices never removed man’s sin. “It is not
possible…”, Heb. 10:4. The Israelite’s offering implied
confession of sin in anticipation of Christ’s sacrifice
which did, finally, “put away” the sins “done previously in
the forbearance of God”. Rom. 3:25; Heb. 9:15, 26. The word
“atonement” does not occur in the New Testament; the word in
Rom. 5:11 is “reconciliation”.

The beginning of the subject of propitiation is found far
back in the Bible, back to the designing of the tabernacle
in the wilderness, the tent which God had the people of
Israel set up which would be the center of His presence on
earth.

The tabernacle occupies a large portion of Scripture,
sixteen chapters in the book of Exodus and the whole book of
Leviticus. Every feature of the tabernacle, of the worship
carried out there, of the priestly life and duties, of the
vestments of the priests, the sacrifices, the feast
days–every feature was vitally important and designed by the
Lord for eternal purposes. It is very important for the
church age believer to have a good working knowledge of the
Levitical system in order to appreciate fully the work of
Christ and the plan of God as they have been instituted in
the world.

There was great stress on the blueprint of the tabernacle.

Exodus 25:8, 9 “And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may
dwell among them. According to all that I show thee, after
the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the
instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.”

The pattern was given to Moses on Mt. Sinai, along with the
Law. **Read Hebrews 8:1–6**. The tabernacle was a symbolical
expression of spiritual truth. The congregation of the Jews
did not go beyond the courtyard of the tabernacle. They made
offerings only at the brazen altar; and only the priests
were allowed to go anyplace else in the tabernacle. The
tabernacle was the dwelling place of God on earth, and God
was unapproachable by sinful men. The main lessons being
taught had to do with the perfection of God and the
sinfulness of man.

The Furniture of the Tabernacle

**Brazen Altar** – This altar was the beginning of a
person’s approach to God. Animal sacrifices made there
taught that substitutionary sacrifice is the first step
toward fellowship with God. When a person passed outside the
gate of the tabernacle, the only thing that he could see was
the smoke rising from the burnt offerings, and through the
one gate could be seen the altar of sacrifice and the blood
being shed.  Everything else was hidden from view by the
curtain. This was a continuous reminder of “the Lamb of God
that takes away the sin of the world.” The only thing the
unbeliever can ever see is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the
good news of Christ’s substitutionary sacrifice for us.

A description of the brazen altar is found in Ex. 27:1–8 and
Ex. 38:1-7.

**The Laver**– Here the priests cleaned their hands and arms
before performing any service or act of worship (Ex.
30:17-21). It was placed between the brazen altar and the
tent of worship (the holy place). This cleansing symbolized
the spiritual cleansing which is essential to both worship
and service.

**The Candlesticks**– These illustrated the need for
illumination, the light of the world. See Ex. 25:31–40;
37:17–24.

**The Table of Bread** – An illustration of the need for
spiritual food.  See Ex. 25:23–30; 37:10–16.

**The Altar of Incense**– From Ex. 30:1–10, this piece of
tabernacle furniture illustrated the need for acceptable
worship and prayer. No animals were offered on this altar.
The offering was an incense offering, indicating that which
is pleasing to God, divine good (gold, silver, and precious
stones). The fire for the altar of incense came from the
brazen altar, indicating that worship can only come after
salvation. No strange fire was allowed; and Nadab and Abihu
died for disobeying this rule.

**The Veil**– The veil symbolized the barrier between God
and man; only the high priest could enter the holy of
holies, and that only once a year on the day of atonement,
to offer the blood on the mercy seat of the ark of the
covenant.

**The Ark of the Covenant** – The ark of the covenant was
located in the holy of holies of the tabernacle. It was made
of acacia wood and overlaid with gold. Its dimensions were
50 inches long by 30 inches wide by 30 inches deep. The ark
was a picture of Christ bearing our sins, the box part
representing Christ. The wood illustrated the humanity of
Christ, the gold represented His deity.

Inside the ark were three objects representing sin (Num.
17:8, 10; Heb. 9:4). The tables of the Law represented sin
in the sense of violation or transgression of God’s order.
The pot of manna represented rejection of God’s provision.
Aaron’s rod represented revolt against God’s authority.

Over the top of the box was a lid of solid gold, the mercy
seat (or throne). Over each end of the mercy seat was a gold
cherub, the highest ranking angel. The first cherub
represented the absolute righteousness of God, and the
second cherub represented the justice of God. Together they
represented the holiness of God. The cherubs faced toward
each other, wings outstretched towards each other, and
looked down at the mercy seat. “Righteousness” looks down
and condemns (Rom. 3:23).  “Justice” looks down and assesses
a penalty.

Once a year, on the day of atonement, the high priest went
into the holy of holies twice; once to make atonement for
his own sins, and then to do so for the people. He sprinkled
blood from the sacrifice on the ark, on the top of the mercy
seat, between the cherubs. This was a graphic illustration
of God’s grace provision for sin. “Righteousness” looks at
the blood of the animal, which represents the spiritual
death of Christ on the cross, His substitutionary atonement,
and is satisfied. “Justice” looks at the blood and is
satisfied that the penalty paid for sin was sufficient,
teaching that Christ was judged and paid the penalty for us.

Therefore, the ark speaks of redemption - Christ paid for
our sins, paid our ransom, to purchase us from the slave
market of sin.

So we have in the ark and the mercy seat a picture of God’s
satisfaction with the work of Jesus Christ known as
propitiation.

Now, the Hebrew word for mercy seat is **kapporeth**. The
Greek word used in the Septuagint translation of the Old
Testament is **hilasterion**. This same Greek word is found
in the New Testament in Rom. 3:25; Heb. 9:5; 1 John 2:2; and
4:10. and is translated “mercy seat” or “place of
propitiation”. So there is a direct relationship between the
mercy seat in the tabernacle and the doctrine of
propitiation.

Because of propitiation, God is free to love the believer
without compromising either His righteousness or justice.
The thought in the Old Testament sacrifices and in the New
Testament fulfillment is that Christ completely satisfied
the just demands of a holy God for judgment of sin.

Propitiation is not the placating of a vengeful God; but it
is, rather, the satisfying of the righteousness of a holy
God making it possible for Him to show mercy without
compromise. Propitiation demonstrates the consistency of
God’s character in saving the worst sinners. Propitiation
reconciles man to God. This means that sin is no longer the
issued between man and God. The only issue, both for the Old
Testament and New Testament believers, is “believe on the
Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.” (Acts 16:31)

**The Barrier**

The word “barrier” has been coined by Bible teachers (it is
not a Bible word) to refer to those characteristics of man
and of God which cause man to be alienated from God. The
barrier, as described in six parts below, represents
mankind’s need to be reconciled to God by God’s grace
provision.

1. Every person has a retroactive “position” in Adam.
  Because Adam died spiritually, every person is born
  spiritually dead. Read 1 Cor. 15:22 and Eph. 2:5, 6.

  This problem is solved by God’s offering to us a “position”
  in Christ, a condition which forms the basis for the
  doctrines related to positional truth. Read 1 John 5:11, 12;
  1 Cor. 15:22; Eph. 1:7.

2. Man’s physical birth places him in a condemned human
  race: 1 Cor.  15:22; Eph. 2:5, 6.

  This problem is solved by God’s allowing us to become
  members of His family through regeneration: John 1:11, 12;
  3:3 ff; Gal. 3:26; Titus 3:5.

3. God’s perfect character, His glory, His perfect essence,
  disallows imperfection of any kind. Example: The Ten
  Commandments. Read Rom. 3:23; Gal. 3:22, 23; Ps. 145:17.

  But the death of Christ on the cross paid the penalty for
  our sin. He was our propitiation. Propitiation is “the work
  of the Lord Jesus Christ by which He appeases the wrath of
  God and conciliates Him who would otherwise be offended by
  our sin.” Read 1 John 2:2; Rom. 3:25.

4. Man’s personal righteousness falls short of God’s perfect
  righteousness: Isa. 64:6; Rom. 3:10–12; Rom. 5:6-11.

  This problem is solved in two ways. First, by justification,
  “God’s act of grace by which He pardons the sinner and
  accepts him as righteous on account of the atonement of
  Christ.” Read Rom. 3:24; 5:1.

  Then, by imputation, “the act of God by which He credits
  human sin to Christ in order that He may in turn credit
  righteousness to men.” Read Rom. 3:22; 2 Cor. 5:21.

5. Man’s personal sin causes him to fall short on a day by
  day basis: Rom. 3:23. This problem is solved by redemption,
  by which man is purchased from the slave market of sin and
  set free as a citizen of the heavenly kingdom: John 8:31-36;
  Eph. 1:7.

6. Man stands under the penalty of sin: Rom. 6:23; 5:12.

The penalty for sin was paid by Jesus Christ on the cross.
This is known as expiation, a blotting out of sin: Col.
2:14.

The barrier is removed and man is free to approach God. God
is free to treat man in grace. God’s righteousness and
justice are satisfied. The complete penalty has been paid.

There is no double jeopardy for sins committed. “As far as
the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our
transgressions from us.” Therefore, the only issue to be
faced by any person is whether he believes in Jesus Christ
and His work on the cross. Read Acts 16:30: John 3:15-17,
36; 5:24.
