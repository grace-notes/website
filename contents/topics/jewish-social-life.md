Preface
=======

The object of this volume is kindred to that of my previous book on *The
Temple, its Ministry and Services as they were at the Time of Jesus
Christ*. In both I have wished to transport the reader into the land of
Palestine at the time of our Lord and of His apostles, and to show him,
so far as lay within the scope of each book, as it were, the scene on
which, and the persons among whom the events recorded in New Testament
history had taken place. For I believe, that in measure as we realize
its surroundings–so to speak, see and hear for ourselves what passed at
the time, enter into its ideas, become familiar with its habits, modes
of thinking, its teaching and worship–shall we not only understand many
of the expressions and allusions in the New Testament, but also gain
fresh evidence of the truth of its history alike from its faithfulness
to the picture of society, such as we know it to have been, and from the
contrast of its teaching and aims to those of the contemporaries of our
Lord.

For, a careful study of the period leaves this conviction on the mind:
that–with reverence be it said–Jesus Christ was strictly of His time,
and that the New Testament is, in its narratives, language, and
allusions, strictly true to the period and circumstances in which its
events are laid. But in another, and far more important, aspect there is
no similarity between Christ and His period. “Never man”–of that, or any
subsequent period–“spoke like this man”; never man lived or died as He.
Assuredly, if He was the Son of David, He also is the Son of God, the
Savior of the world.

In my book on The Temple, its Ministry and Services, I endeavored to
carry the reader with me into the Sanctuary, and to make him witness all
connected with its institutions, its priesthood, and its solemnities. In
this book I have sought to take him into ordinary civil society, and to
make him mingle with the men and women of that period, see them in their
homes and families, learn their habits and manners, and follow them in
their ordinary life–all, as illustrative of New Testament history; at
the same time endeavoring to present in a popular form the scenes
witnessed.

Another, and perhaps the most important part in its bearing on
Christianity, yet remains to be done: to trace the progress of religious
thought–as regards the canon of Scripture, the Messiah, the law, sin,
and salvation–to describe the character of theological literature, and
to show the state of doctrinal belief at the time of our Lord. It is
here especially that we should see alike the kinship in form and the
almost contrast in substance between what Judaism was at the time of
Christ, and the teaching and the kingdom of our Blessed Lord. But this
lay quite outside the scope of the present volume, and belongs to a
larger work for which this and my previous book may, in a sense, be
regarded as fore studies.

Accordingly, where civil society touched, as on so many points it does,
on the theological and the doctrinal, it was only possible to “sketch”
it, leaving the outlines to be filled up. To give a complete
representation of the times of our Lord, in all their bearings–to show
not only who they were among whom Jesus Christ moved, but what they
knew, thought, and believed–and this as the frame, so to speak, in which
to set as a picture the life of our Blessed Lord Himself, such must now
be the work, to which, with all prayerful reverence and with most
earnest study, I shall henceforth set myself.

It seemed needful to state this, in order to explain both the plan of
this book and the manner of its treatment. I will only add, that it
embodies the results of many years’ study, in which I have availed
myself of every help within my reach. It might seem affectation, were I
to enumerate the names of all the authorities consulted or books read in
the course of these studies. Those mentioned in the foot-notes
constitute but a very small proportion of them.

Throughout, my constant object has been to illustrate the New Testament
history and teaching. Even the “Scripture Index” at the close will show
in how many instances this has been attempted. Most earnestly then do I
hope, that these pages may be found to cast some additional light on the
New Testament, and that they will convey fresh evidence–to my mind of
the strongest kind–and in a new direction, of the truth “of those things
which are most surely believed among us.” And now it only remains at the
close of these investigations once more to express my own full and
joyous belief in that grand truth to which all leads up–that “Christ is
the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that believeth.”

Chapter 1. Palestine Eighteen Centuries Ago
===========================================

Eighteen and a half centuries ago, and the land which now lies
desolate–its bare, grey hills looking into ill-tilled or neglected
valleys, its timber cut down, its olive- and vine-clad terraces crumbled
into dust, its villages stricken with poverty and squalor, its
thoroughfares insecure and deserted, its native population well-nigh
gone, and with them its industry, wealth, and strength–presented a scene
of beauty, richness, and busy life almost unsurpassed in the then known
world. The Rabbis never weary of its praises, whether their theme be the
physical or the moral pre-eminence of Palestine.

It happened, so writes one of the oldest Hebrew commentaries, that Rabbi
Jonathan was sitting under a fig-tree, surrounded by his students. Of a
sudden he noticed how the ripe fruit overhead, bursting for richness,
dropped its luscious juice on the ground, while at a little distance the
distended udder of a she-goat was no longer able to hold the milk.
“Behold,” exclaimed the Rabbi, as the two streams mingled, “the literal
fulfillment of the promise: ‘a land flowing with milk and honey.’” “The
land of Israel is not lacking in any product whatever,” argued Rabbi
Meir, “as it is written (Deu 8:9): ‘Thou shalt not lack anything in
it.’”

Nor were such statements unwarranted; for Palestine combined every
variety of climate, from the snows of Hermon and the cool of Lebanon to
the genial warmth of the Lake of Galilee and the tropical heat of the
Jordan valley. Accordingly not only the fruit trees, the grain, and
garden produce known in our colder latitudes were found in the land,
along with those of sunnier climes, but also the rare spices and
perfumes of the hottest zones. Similarly, it is said, every kind of fish
teemed in its waters, while birds of most gorgeous plumage filled the
air with their song. Within such small compass the country must have
been unequalled for charm and variety. On the eastern side of Jordan
stretched wide plains, upland valleys, park-like forests, and almost
boundless corn and pasture lands; on the western side were terraced
hills, covered with olives and vines, delicious glens, in which sweet
springs murmured, and fairy-like beauty and busy life, as around the
Lake of Galilee.

In the distance stretched the wide sea, dotted with spreading sails;
here was luxurious richness, as in the ancient possessions of Issachar,
Manasseh, and Ephraim; and there, beyond these plains and valleys, the
highland scenery of Judah, shelving down through the pasture tracts of
the Negev, or South country, into the great and terrible wilderness. And
over all, so long as God’s blessing lasted, were peace and plenty. Far
as the eye could reach, browsed “the cattle on a thousand hills”; the
pastures were “clothed with flocks, the valleys also covered over with
corn”; and the land, “greatly enriched with the river of God,” seemed to
“shout for joy,” and “also to sing.” Such a possession, heaven-given at
the first and heaven-guarded throughout, might well kindle the deepest
enthusiasm.

“We find,” writes one of the most learned Rabbinical commentators,
supporting each assertion by a reference to Scripture (R. Bechai), “that
thirteen things are in the sole ownership of the Holy One, blessed be
His Name! and these are they: the silver, the gold, the priesthood,
Israel, the first-born, the altar, the first-fruits, the anointing oil,
the tabernacle of meeting, the kingship of the house of David, the
sacrifices, the land of Israel, and the eldership.” In truth, fair as
the land was, its conjunction with higher spiritual blessings gave it
its real and highest value. “Only in Palestine does the Shechinah
manifest itself,” taught the Rabbis. Outside its sacred boundaries no
such revelation was possible. It was there that rapt prophets had seen
their visions, and psalmists caught strains of heavenly hymns. Palestine
was the land that had Jerusalem for its capital, and on its highest hill
that temple of snowy marble and glittering gold for a sanctuary, around
which clustered such precious memories, hallowed thoughts, and glorious,
wide-reaching hopes.

There is no religion so strictly local as that of Israel. Heathenism was
indeed the worship of national deities, and Judaism that of Jehovah, the
God of heaven and earth.

But the national deities of the heathen might be transported, and their
rites adapted to foreign manners. On the other hand, while Christianity
was from the first universal in its character and design, the religious
institutions and the worship of the Pentateuch, and even the prospects
opened by the prophets were, so far as they concerned Israel, strictly
of Palestine and for Palestine.

They are wholly incompatible with the permanent loss of the land. An
extra-Palestinian Judaism, without priesthood, altar, temple,
sacrifices, tithes, first-fruits, Sabbatical and Jubilee years, must
first set aside the Pentateuch, unless, as in Christianity, all these be
regarded as blossoms designed to ripen into fruit, as types pointing to,
and fulfilled in higher realities.
<sup>**[<sup>1</sup>](#sdfootnote1sym)**</sup> Outside the land even the
people are no longer Israel: in view of the Gentiles they are Jews; in
their own view, “the dispersed abroad.”

A solitary voice ventured even in the second century on the suggestion
that the sacrificial worship had been intended only by way of
accommodation, to preserve Israel from lapsing into heathen rites!

All this the Rabbis could not fail to perceive. Accordingly when,
immediately after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, they set
themselves to reconstruct their broken commonwealth, it was on a new
basis indeed, but still within Palestine. Palestine was the Mount Sinai
of Rabbinism. Here rose the spring of the Halachah, or traditional law,
whence it flowed in ever-widening streams; here, for the first
centuries, the learning, the influence, and the rule of Judaism
centered; and there they would fain have perpetuated it.

The first attempts at rivalry by the Babylonian schools of Jewish
learning were keenly resented and sharply put down. Only the force of
circumstances drove the Rabbis afterwards voluntarily to seek safety and
freedom in the ancient seats of their captivity, where, politically
unmolested, they could give the final development to their system. It
was this desire to preserve the nation and its learning in Palestine
which inspired such sentiments as we are about to quote.

“The very air of Palestine makes one wise,” said the Rabbis. The
Scriptural account of the borderland of Paradise, watered by the river
Havilah, of which it is said that “the gold of that land is good,” was
applied to their earthly Eden, and paraphrased to mean, “there is no
learning like that of Palestine.” It was a saying, that “to live in
Palestine was equal to the observance of all the commandments.” “He that
hath his permanent abode in Palestine,” so taught the Talmud, “is sure
of the life to come.” “Three things,” we read in another authority, “are
Israel’s through suffering: Palestine, traditional lore, and the world
to come.” Nor did this feeling abate with the desolation of their
country. In the third and fourth centuries of our era they still taught,
“He that dwelleth in Palestine is without sin.”

Centuries of wandering and of changes have not torn the passionate love
of this land from the heart of the people. Even superstition becomes
here pathetic. If the Talmud (Cheth. iii. a.) had already expressed the
principle, “Whoever is buried in the land of Israel, is as if he were
buried under the altar,” one of the most ancient Hebrew commentaries
(Ber. Rabba) goes much farther.

From the injunction of Jacob and Joseph, and the desire of the fathers
to be buried within the sacred soil, it is argued that those who lay
there were to be the first “to walk before the Lord in the land of the
living” (Psa 116:9), the first to rise from the dead and to enjoy the
days of the Messiah. Not to deprive of their reward the pious, who had
not the privilege of residing in Palestine, it was added, that God would
make subterranean roads and passages into the Holy Land, and that, when
their dust reached it, the Spirit of the Lord would raise them to new
life, as it is written (Eze 37:12-14): “O My people, I will open your
graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into
the land of Israel…and shall put My Spirit in you, and ye shall live;
and I shall place you in your own land.”

Almost every prayer and hymn breathes the same love of Palestine.
Indeed, it were impossible, by any extracts, to convey the pathos of
some of those elegies in which the Synagogue still bewails the loss of
Zion, or expresses the pent-up longing for its restoration. Desolate,
they cling to its ruins, and believe, hope, and pray–oh, how ardently!
in almost every prayer–for the time that shall come, when the land, like
Sarah of old, will, at the bidding of the Lord, have youth, beauty, and
fruitfulness restored, and in Messiah the King “a horn of salvation
shall be raised up” <sup>**[<sup>2</sup>](#sdfootnote2sym)**</sup> to
the house of David.

Yet it is most true, as noticed by a recent writer, that no place could
have been more completely swept of relics than is Palestine. Where the
most solemn transactions have taken place; where, if we only knew it,
every footstep might be consecrated, and rocks, and caves, and
mountain-tops be devoted to the holiest remembrances–we are almost in
absolute ignorance of exact localities.

In Jerusalem itself even the features of the soil, the valleys,
depressions, and hills have changed, or at least lie buried deep under
the accumulated ruins of centuries. It almost seems as if the Lord meant
to do with the land what Hezekiah had done with that relic of Moses–the
brazen serpent–when he stamped it to pieces, lest its sacred memories
should convert it into an occasion for idolatry. The lie of land and
water, of mountain and valley, are the same; Hebron, Bethlehem, the
Mount of Olives, Nazareth, the Lake of Gennesaret, the land of Galilee,
are still there, but all changed in form and appearance, and with no
definite spot to which one could with absolute certainty attach the most
sacred events. Events, then, not places; spiritual realities, not their
outward surroundings, have been given to mankind by the land of
Palestine.

“So long as Israel inhabited Palestine,” says the Babylonian Talmud,
“the country was wide; but now it has become narrow.” There is only too
much historical truth underlying this somewhat curiously-worded
statement. Each successive change left the boundaries of the Holy Land
narrowed. Never as yet has it actually reached the extent indicated in
the original promise to Abraham (Gen 15:18), and afterwards confirmed to
the children of Israel (Exo 23:31). The nearest approach to it was
during the reign of King David, when the power of Judah extended as far
as the river Euphrates (2 Sam 8:3-14).

At present the country to which the name Palestine attaches is smaller
than at any previous period. As of old, it still stretches north and
south “from Dan to Beersheba”; in the east and west from Salcah (the
modern Sulkhad) to “the great sea,” the Mediterranean. Its superficial
area is about 12,000 square miles, its length from 140 to 180, its
breadth in the south about 75, and in the north from 100 to 120 miles.
To put it more pictorially, the modern Palestine is about twice as large
as Wales; it is smaller than Holland, and about equal in size to
Belgium. Moreover, from the highest mountain-peaks a glimpse of almost
the whole country may be obtained. So small was the land which the Lord
chose as the scene of the most marvellous events that ever happened on
earth, and whence He appointed light and life to flow forth into all the
world!

When our blessed Saviour trod the soil of Palestine, the country had
already undergone many changes.

The ancient division of tribes had given way; the two kingdoms of Judah
and Israel existed no longer; and the varied foreign domination, and the
brief period of absolute national independence, had alike ceased. Yet,
with the characteristic tenacity of the East for the past, the names of
the ancient tribes still attached to some of the districts formerly
occupied by them (comp. Matt 4:13, 15). A comparatively small number of
the exiles had returned to Palestine with Ezra and Nehemiah, and the
Jewish inhabitants of the country consisted either of those who had
originally been left in the land, or of the tribes of Judah and
Benjamin.

The controversy about the ten tribes, which engages so much attention in
our days, raged even at the time of our Lord. “Will He go unto the
dispersed among the Gentiles?” asked the Jews, when unable to fathom the
meaning of Christ’s prediction of His departure, using that mysterious
vagueness of language in which we generally clothe things which we
pretend to, but really do not, know. “The ten tribes are beyond the
Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude, and not to be
estimated by numbers,” writes Josephus, with his usual grandiloquent
self-complacency. But where–he informs us as little as any of his other
contemporaries. We read in the earliest Jewish authority, the Mishnah
(Sanh. x. 3): “The ten tribes shall never return again, as it is written
(Deu 29:28), ‘And He cast them into another land, as this day.’ As ‘this
day’ goeth and does not return again, so they also go and do not return.
This is the view of Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Elieser says, ‘As the day becomes
dark and has light again, so the ten tribes, to whom darkness has come;
but light shall also be restored to them.’”

At the time of Christ’s birth Palestine was governed by Herod the Great;
that is, it was nominally an independent kingdom, but under the
suzerainty of Rome. On the death of Herod–that is, very close upon the
opening of the gospel story–a fresh, though only temporary, division of
his dominions took place. The events connected with it fully illustrate
the parable of our Lord, recorded in Luke 19:12-15, 27. If they do not
form its historical groundwork, they were at least so fresh in the
memory of Christ’s hearers, that their minds must have involuntarily
reverted to them. Herod died, as he had lived, cruel and treacherous. A
few days before his end, he had once more altered his will, and
nominated Archelaus his successor in the kingdom; Herod Antipas (the
Herod of the gospels), tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea; and Philip,
tetrarch of Gaulonitis, Trachonitis, Batanaea, and Panias–districts to
which, in the sequel, we may have further to refer.

As soon after the death of Herod as circumstances would permit, and when
he had quelled a rising in Jerusalem, Archelaus hastened to Rome to
obtain the emperor’s confirmation of his father’s will. He was
immediately followed by his brother Herod Antipas, who in a previous
testament of Herod had been left what Archelaus now claimed. Nor were
the two alone in Rome, They found there already a number of members of
Herod’s family, each clamorous for something, but all agreed that they
would rather have none of their own kindred as king, and that the
country should be put under Roman sway; if otherwise, they anyhow
preferred Herod Antipas to Archelaus. Each of the brothers had, of
course, his own party, intriguing, manoeuvring, and trying to influence
the emperor. Augustus inclined from the first to Archelaus.

The formal decision, however, was for a time postponed by a fresh
insurrection in Judaea, which was quelled only with difficulty.
Meanwhile, a Jewish deputation appeared in Rome, entreating that none of
the Herodians might ever be appointed king, on the ground of their
infamous deeds, which they related, and that they (the Jews) might be
allowed to live according to their own laws, under the suzerainty of
Rome. Augustus ultimately decided to carry out the will of Herod the
Great, but gave Archelaus the title of ethnarch instead of king,
promising him the higher grade if he proved deserving of it (Matt 2:22).

On his return to Judaea, Archelaus (according to the story in the
parable) took bloody vengeance on “his citizens that hated him, and sent
a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over
us.” The reign of Archelaus did not last long. Fresh and stronger
complaints came from Judaea. Archealus was deposed, and Judaea joined to
the Roman province of Syria, but with a procurator of its own. The
revenues of Archelaus, so long as he reigned, amounted to very
considerably over 240,000 pounds a year; those of his brothers
respectively to a third and sixth of that sum. But his was as nothing
compared to the income of Herod the Great, which stood at the enormous
sum of about 680,000 pounds; and that afterwards of Agrippa II, which is
computed as high as half a million. In thinking of these figures, it is
necessary to bear in mind the general cheapness of living in Palestine
at the time, which may be gathered from the smallness of the coins in
circulation, and from the lowness of the labour market.

The smallest coin, a (Jewish) perutah, amounted to only the sixteenth of
a penny. Again, readers of the New Testament will remember that a
labourer was wont to receive for a day’s work in field or vineyard a
denarius (Matt 20:2), or about 8d., while the Good Samaritan paid for
the charge of the sick person whom he left in the inn only two denars,
or about 1s. 4d (Luke 10:35).

But we are anticipating. Our main object was to explain the division of
Palestine in the time of our Lord. Politically speaking, it consisted of
Judaea and Samaria, under Roman procurators; Galilee and Peraea (on the
other side Jordan), subject to Herod Antipas, the murderer of John the
Baptist–“that fox” full of cunning and cruelty, to whom the Lord, when
sent by Pilate, would give no answer; and Batanaea, Trachonitis, and
Auranitis, under the rule of the tetrarch Philip. It would require too
many details to describe accurately those latter provinces.

Suffice, that they lay quite to the north-east, and that one of their
principal cities was Caesarea Philippi (called after the Roman emperor,
and after Philip himself), where Peter made that noble confession, which
constituted the rock on which the Church was to be built (Matt 16:16;
Mark 8:29). It was the wife of this Philip, the best of all Herod’s
sons, whom her brother-in-law, Herod Antipas, induced to leave her
husband, and for whose sake he beheaded John (Matt 14:3, etc.; Mark
6:17; Luke 3:19). It is well to know that this adulterous and incestuous
union brought Herod immediate trouble and misery, and that it ultimately
cost him his kingdom, and sent him into life-long banishment.

Such was the political division of Palestine. Commonly it was arranged
into Galilee, Samaria, Judaea, and Peraea. It is scarcely necessary to
say that the Jews did not regard Samaria as belonging to the Holy Land,
but as a strip of foreign country–as the Talmud designates it (Chag. 25
a.), “a Cuthite strip,” or “tongue,” intervening between Galilee and
Judea. From the gospels we know that the Samaritans were not only ranked
with Gentiles and strangers (Matt 10:5; John 4:9,20), but that the very
term Samaritan was one of reproach (John 8:48). “There be two manner of
nations,” says the son of Sirach (Ecclus. 1.25,26), “which my heart
abhorreth, and the third is no nation; they that sit upon the mountain
of Samaria, and they that dwell among the Philistines, and that foolish
people that dwell in Sichem.”

And Josephus has a story to account for the exclusion of the Samaritans
from the Temple, to the effect that in the night of the Passover, when
it was the custom to open the Temple gates at midnight, a Samaritan had
come and strewn bones in the porches and throughout the Temple to defile
the Holy House. Most unlikely as this appears, at least in its details,
it shows the feeling of the people. On the other hand, it must be
admitted that the Samaritans fully retaliated by bitter hatred and
contempt. For, at every period of sore national trial, the Jews had no
more determined or relentless enemies than those who claimed to be the
only true representatives of Israel’s worship and hopes.

Chapter 2. Jews and Gentiles in “The Land”
==========================================

Coming down from Syria, it would have been difficult to fix the exact
spot where, in the view of the Rabbis, “the land” itself began. The
boundary lines, though mentioned in four different documents, are not
marked in anything like geographical order, but as ritual questions
connected with them came up for theological discussion. For, to the
Rabbis the precise limits of Palestine were chiefly interesting so far
as they affected the religious obligations or privileges of a district.
And in this respect the fact that a city was in heathen possession
exercised a decisive influence. Thus the environs of Ascalon, the wall
of Caesarea, and that of Acco, were reckoned within the boundaries of
Palestine, though the cities themselves were not. Indeed, viewing the
question from this point, Palestine was to the Rabbis simply “the land,”
<sup>**[<sup>3</sup>](#sdfootnote3sym)**</sup> all other countries being
summed up under the designation of “outside the land.” In the Talmud,
even the expression “Holy Land,” so common among later Jews and
Christians, <sup>**[<sup>4</sup>](#sdfootnote4sym)**</sup> does not once
occur.

It needed not that addition, which might have suggested a comparison
with other countries; for to the Rabbinist Palestine was not only holy,
but the only holy ground, to the utter exclusion of all other countries,
although they marked within its boundaries an ascending scale of ten
degrees of sanctity, rising from the bare soil of Palestine to the most
holy place in the Temple (Chel. i. 6-9). But “outside the land”
everything was darkness and death. The very dust of a heathen country
was unclean, and it defiled by contact. It was regarded like a grave, or
like the putrescence of death. If a spot of heathen dust had touched an
offering, it must at once be burnt. More than that, if by mischance any
heathen dust had been brought into Palestine, it did not and could not
mingle with that of “the land,” but remained to the end what it had
been–unclean, defiled, and defiling everything to which it adhered.

This will cast light upon the meaning conveyed by the symbolical
directions of our Lord to His disciples (Matt 10:14), when He sent them
forth to mark out the boundary lines of the true Israel–“the kingdom of
heaven,” that was at hand: “Whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear
your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust
of your feet.” In other words, they were not only to leave such a city
or household, but it was to be considered and treated as if it were
heathen, just as in the similar case mentioned in Matthew 18:17. All
contact with such must be avoided, all trace of it shaken off, and that,
even though, like some of the cities in Palestine that were considered
heathen, they were surrounded on every side by what was reckoned as
belonging to Israel.

The Mishnah (Shev, vi. 1; Chall. iv. 8) marks, in reference to certain
ordinances, “three lands” which might equally be designated as
Palestine, but to which different ritual regulations applied.

The first comprised, “all which they who came up from Babylon took
possession of in the land of Israel and unto Chezib” (about three hours
north of Acre); the second, “all that they who came up from Egypt took
possession of from Chezib and unto the river (Euphrates) eastward, and
unto Amanah” (supposed to be a mountain near Antioch, in Syria); while
the third, seemingly indicating certain ideal outlines, was probably
intended to mark what “the land” would have been, according to the
original promise of God, although it was never possessed to that extent
by Israel. <sup>**[<sup>5</sup>](#sdfootnote5sym)**</sup> For our
present purpose, of course, only the first of these definitions must be
applied to “the land.”

We read in Menachoth vii. 1: "Every offering,
<sup>**[<sup>6</sup>](#sdfootnote6sym)**</sup> whether of the
congregation or of an individual (public or private), may come from ‘the
land,’ or from ‘outside the land, be of the new product (of the year) or
of old product, except the omer (the wave-sheaf at the Passover) and the
two loaves (at Pentecost), which may only be brought from new product
(that of the current year), and from that (which grows) within ’the
land.’" To these two, the Mishnah adds in another passage (Chel. i. 6)
also the Biccurim, or first-fruits in their fresh state, although
inaccurately, since the latter were likewise brought from what is called
by the Rabbis Syria, <sup>**[<sup>7</sup>](#sdfootnote7sym)**</sup>
which seems to have been regarded as, in a sense, intermediate between
“the land” and “outside the land.”

The term Soria, or Syria, does not include that country alone, but all
the lands which, according to the Rabbis, David had subdued, such as
Mesopotamia, Syria, Zobah, Achlab, etc. It would be too lengthy to
explain in detail the various ordinances in regard to which Soria was
assimilated to, and those by which it was distinguished from, Palestine
proper. The preponderance of duty and privilege was certainly in favour
of Syria, so much so, that if one could have stepped from its soil
straight to that of Palestine, or joined fields in the two countries,
without the interposition of any Gentile strip, the land and the dust of
Syria would have been considered clean, like that of Palestine itself
(Ohol. xviii. 7).

There was thus around “the land” a sort of inner band, consisting of
those countries supposed to have been annexed by King David, and termed
Soria. But besides this, there was also what may be called an outer
band, towards the Gentile world, consisting of Egypt, Babylon, Ammon and
Moab, the countries in which Israel had a special interest, and which
were distinguished from the rest, “outside the land,” by this, that they
were liable to tithes and the Therumoth, or first-fruits in a prepared
state. Of course neither of these contributions was actually brought
into Palestine, but either employed by them for their sacred purposes,
or else redeemed.

Maimonides arranges all countries into three classes, “so far as
concerns the precepts connected with the soil”–“the land, Soria, and
outside the land”; and he divides the land of Israel into territory
possessed before and after the Exile, while he also distinguishes
between Egypt, Babylon, Moab, and Ammon, and other lands (Hilch. Ther.
i. 6). In popular estimate other distinctions were likewise made. Thus
Rabbi Jose of Galilee would have it (Bicc. i. 10), that Biccurim
<sup>**[<sup>8</sup>](#sdfootnote8sym)**</sup> were not to be brought
from the other side of Jordan, “because it was not a land flowing with
milk and honey.”

But as the Rabbinical law in this respect differed from the view
expressed by Rabbi Jose, his must have been an afterthought, probably
intended to account for the fact that they beyond Jordan did not bring
their first-fruits to the Temple. Another distinction claimed for the
country west of the Jordan curiously reminds us of the fears expressed
by the two and a half tribes on their return to their homes, after the
first conquest of Palestine under Joshua (Josh 22:24,25), since it
declared the land east of Jordan less sacred, on account of the absence
of the Temple, of which it had not been worthy. Lastly, Judaea proper
claimed pre-eminence over Galilee, as being the centre of Rabbinism.
Perhaps it may be well here to state that, notwithstanding strict
uniformity on all principal points, Galilee and Judaea had each its own
peculiar legal customs and rights, which differed in many particulars
one from the other.

What has hitherto been explained from Rabbinical writings gains fresh
interest when we bring it to bear on the study of the New Testament.
For, we can now understand how those Zealots from Jerusalem, who would
have bent the neck of the Church under the yoke of the law of Moses,
sought out in preference the flourishing communities in Syria for the
basis of their operations (Acts 15:1). There was a special significance
in this, as Syria formed a kind of outer Palestine, holding an
intermediate position between it and heathen lands.

Again, it results from our inquiries, that, what the Rabbis considered
as the land of Israel proper, may be regarded as commencing immediately
south of Antioch. Thus the city where the first Gentile Church was
formed (Acts 11:20,21); where the disciples were first called Christians
(Acts 11:26); where Paul so long exercised his ministry, and whence he
started on his missionary journeys, was, significantly enough, just
outside the land of Israel.

Immediately beyond it lay the country over which the Rabbis claimed
entire sway. Travelling southwards, the first district which one would
reach would be what is known from the gospels as “the coasts (or tracts)
of Tyre and Sidon.” St. Mark describes the district more particularly
(Mark 7:24) as “the borders of Tyre and Sidon.” These stretched,
according to Josephus (Jewish War, iii, 35), at the time of our Lord,
from the Mediterranean towards Jordan. It was to these extreme boundary
tracts of “the land,” that Jesus had withdrawn from the Pharisees, when
they were offended at His opposition to their “blind” traditionalism;
and there He healed by the word of His power the daughter of the “woman
of Canaan,” the intensity of whose faith drew from His lips words of
precious commendation (Matt 15:28; Mark 7:29).

It was chiefly a heathen district where the Saviour spoke the word of
healing, and where the woman would not let the Messiah of Israel go
without an answer. She herself was a Gentile. Indeed, not only that
district, but all around, and farther on, the territory of Philip, was
almost entirely heathen. More than that, strange as it may sound, all
around the districts inhabited by the Jews the country was, so to speak,
fringed by foreign nationalities and by heathen worship, rites, and
customs.

Properly to understand the history of the time and the circumstances
indicated in the New Testament, a correct view of the state of parties
in this respect is necessary. And here we must guard against a not
unnatural mistake. If any one had expected to find within the boundaries
of “the land” itself one nationality, one language, the same interests,
or even one religion publicly professed, he would have been bitterly
disappointed. It was not merely for the presence of the Romans and their
followers, and of a more or less influential number of foreign settlers,
but the Holy Land itself was a country of mixed and hostile races, of
divided interests, where close by the side of the narrowest and most
punctilious Pharisaism heathen temples rose, and heathen rites and
customs openly prevailed.

In a general way all this will be readily understood. For, those who
returned from Babylon were comparatively few in number, and confessedly
did not occupy the land in its former extent. During the troubled period
which followed, there was a constant influx of heathen, and unceasing
attempts were made to introduce and perpetuate foreign elements.

Even the language of Israel had undergone a change. In the course of
time the ancient Hebrew had wholly given place to the Aramaean dialect,
except in public worship and in the learned academies of theological
doctors. Such words and names in the gospels as Raka, Abba, Golgotha,
Gabbatha, Akel-Dama, Bartholomaios, Barabbas, Bar-Jesus, and the various
verbal quotations, are all Aramaean. It was probably in that language
that Paul addressed the infuriated multitude, when standing on the top
of the steps leading from the Temple into the fortress Antonia (Acts
21:40; 22:1ff).

But along with the Hebraic Aramaean–for so we would designate the
language–the Greek had for some time been making its way among the
people. The Mishnah itself contains a very large number of Greek and
Latin words with Hebraic terminations, showing how deeply Gentile life
and customs around had affected even those who hated them most, and, by
inference, how thoroughly they must have penetrated Jewish society in
general. But besides, it had been long the policy of their rulers
systematically to promote all that was Grecian in thought and feeling.
It needed the obstinate determinateness, if not the bigotry, of
Pharisaism to prevent their success, and this may perhaps partly explain
the extreme of their antagonism against all that was Gentile. A brief
notice of the religious state of the outlying districts of the country
may place this in a clearer light.

In the far north-east of the land, occupying at least in part the
ancient possession of Manasseh, were the provinces belonging to the
tetrarch Philip (Luke 3:1). Many spots there (Mark 8:22; Luke 9:10; Matt
16:13) are dear to the Christian memory. After the Exile these districts
had been peopled by wild, predatory nomads, like the Bedawin of our
days. These lived chiefly in immense caves, where they stored their
provisions, and in case of attack defended themselves and their flocks.
Herod the Great and his successors had indeed subdued, and settled among
them, a large number of Jewish and Idumaean colonists–the former brought
from Babylon, under the leadership of one Zamaris, and attracted, like
the modern German colonists in parts of Russia, by immunity from
taxation. But the vast majority of the people were still Syrians and
Grecians, rude, barbarous, and heathens.

Indeed, there the worship of the old Syrian gods had scarcely given way
to the more refined rites of Greece. It was in this neighbourhood that
Peter made that noble confession of faith, on which, as on a rock, the
Church is built. But Caesarea Philippi was originally Paneas, the city
devoted to Pan; nor does its change of name indicate a more Jewish
direction on the part of its inhabitants. Indeed, Herod the Great had
built there a temple to Augustus.

But further particulars are scarcely necessary, for recent researches
have everywhere brought to light relics of the worship of the Phoenician
Astarte, of the ancient Syrian god of the sun, and even of the Egyptian
Ammon, side by side with that of the well-known Grecian deities. The
same may be said of the refined Damascus, the territory of which formed
here the extreme boundary of Palestine. Passing from the eastern to the
western bounds of Palestine, we find that in Tyre and Ptolemais
Phrygian, Egyptians, Phoenician, and Greek rites contended for the
mastery. In the centre of Palestine, notwithstanding the pretence of the
Samaritans to be the only true representatives of the religion of Moses,
the very name of their capital, Sebaste, for Samaria, showed how
thoroughly Grecianised was that province. Herod had built in Samaria
also a magnificent temple to Augustus; and there can be no doubt that,
as the Greek language, so Grecian rites and idolatry prevailed.

Another outlying district, the Decapolis (Matt 4:25; Mark 5:20, 7:31),
was almost entirely Grecian in constitution, language, and worship. It
was in fact, a federation of ten heathen cities within the territory of
Israel, possessing a government of their own. Little is known of its
character; indeed, the cities themselves are not always equally
enumerated by different writers. We name those of most importance to
readers of the New Testament. Scythopolis, the ancient Beth-shean (Josh
17:11,16; Judg 1:27; 1 Sam 31:10,12, etc.), was the only one of those
cities situated west of the Jordan. It lay about four hours south of
Tiberias. Gadara, the capital of Peraea, is known to us from Matthew
8:28; Mark 5:1; Luke 8:26. Lastly, we mention as specially interesting,
Pella, the place to which the Christians of Jerusalem fled in obedience
to the warning of our Lord (Matt 24:15-20), to escape the doom of the
city, when finally beleaguered by the Romans. The situation of Pella has
not been satisfactorily ascertained, but probably it lay at no great
distance from the ancient Jabesh Gilead.

But to return. From what has been said, it will appear that there
remained only Galilee and Judaea proper, in which strictly Jewish views
and manners must be sought for. Each of these will be described in
detail. For the present it will suffice to remark, that north-eastern or
Upper Galilee was in great part inhabited by Gentiles–Phoenicians,
Syrians, Arabs, and Greeks (Josephus, Jewish War, iii, 419-427), whence
the name “Galilee of the Gentiles” (Matt 4:15).

It is strange in how many even of those cities, with which we are
familiar from the New Testament, the heathen element prevailed.
Tiberias, which gave its name to the lake, was at the time of Christ of
quite recent origin, having been built by the tetrarch Herod Antipas
(the Herod of the gospel history), and named in honour of the Emperor
Tiberius. Although endowed by its founder with many privileges, such as
houses and lands for its inhabitants, and freedom from taxation–the
latter being continued by Vespasian after the Jewish war–Herod had to
colonise it by main force, so far as its few Jewish inhabitants were
concerned. For, the site on which the city stood had of old covered a
place of burial, and the whole ground was therefore levitically unclean
(Josephus, Ant, xviii, 38).

However celebrated, therefore, afterwards as the great and final seat of
the Jewish Sanhedrim, it was originally chiefly un-Jewish. Gaza had its
local deity; Ascalon worshipped Astarte; Joppa was the locality where,
at the time when Peter had his vision there, they still showed on the
rocks of the shore the marks of the chains, by which Andromeda was said
to have been held, when Perseus came to set her free. Caesarea was an
essentially heathen city, though inhabited by many Jews; and one of its
most conspicuous ornaments was another temple to Augustus, built on a
hill opposite the entrance to the harbour, so as to be visible far out
at sea.

But what could be expected, when in Jerusalem itself Herod had reared a
magnificent theatre and amphitheatre, to which gladiators were brought
from all parts of the world, and where games were held, thoroughly
anti-Jewish and heathen in their spirit and tendency? (Josephus, Ant.,
xv, 274). The favourites and counsellors by whom that monarch surrounded
himself were heathens; wherever he or his successors could, they reared
heathen temples, and on all occasions they promoted the spread of
Grecian views. Yet withal they professed to be Jews; they would not
shock Jewish prejudices; indeed, as the building of the Temple, the
frequent advocacy at Rome of the cause of Jews when oppressed, and many
other facts show, the Herodians would fain have kept on good terms with
the national party, or rather used it as their tool.

And so Grecianism spread. Already Greek was spoken and understood by all
the educated classes in the country; it was necessary for intercourse
with the Roman authorities, with the many civil and military officials,
and with strangers; the “superscription” on the coins was in Greek, even
though, to humour the Jews, none of the earlier Herods had his own image
impressed on them. <sup>**[<sup>9</sup>](#sdfootnote9sym)**</sup>
Significantly enough, it was Herod Agrippa I, the murderer of St. James,
and the would-be murderer of St. Peter, who introduced the un-Jewish
practice of images on coins. Thus everywhere the foreign element was
advancing. A change or else a struggle was inevitable in the near
future.

And what of Judaism itself at the period? It was miserably divided, even
though no outward separation had taken place. The Pharisees and
Sadducees held opposite principles, and hated each other; the Essenes
looked down upon them both.

Within Pharisaism the schools of Hillel and Shammai contradicted each
other on almost every matter. But both united in their unbounded
contempt of what they designated as “the country-people”–those who had
no traditional learning, and hence were either unable or unwilling to
share the discussions, and to bear the burdens of legal ordinances,
which constituted the chief matter of traditionalism.

There was only one feeling common to all–high and low, rich and poor,
learned and unlettered: it was that of intense hatred of the foreigner.
The rude Galileans were as “national” as the most punctilious Pharisees;
indeed, in the war against Rome they furnished the most and the bravest
soldiers. Everywhere the foreigner was in sight; his were the taxes
levied, the soldiery, the courts of ultimate appeal, the government. In
Jerusalem they hung over the Temple as a guard in the fortress of
Antonia, and even kept in their custody the high-priest’s garments,
<sup>**[<sup>10</sup>](#sdfootnote10sym)**</sup> so that, before
officiating in the Temple, he had actually always to apply for them to
the procurator or his representative! They were only just more tolerable
as being downright heathens than the Herodians, who mingled Judaism with
heathenism, and, having sprung from foreign slaves, had arrogated to
themselves the kingdom of the Maccabees.

Readers of the New Testament know what separation Pharisaical Jews made
between themselves and heathens. It will be readily understood, that
every contact with heathenism and all aid to its rites should have been
forbidden, and that in social intercourse any levitical defilement,
arising from the use of what was “common or unclean,” was avoided. But
Pharisaism went a great deal further than this. Three days before a
heathen festival all transactions with Gentiles were forbidden, so as to
afford them neither direct nor indirect help towards their rites; and
this prohibition extended even to private festivities, such as a
birthday, the day of return from a journey, etc.

On heathen festive occasions a pious Jew should avoid, if possible,
passing through a heathen city, certainly all dealings in shops that
were festively decorated. It was unlawful for Jewish workmen to assist
in anything that might be subservient either to heathen worship or
heathen rule, including in the latter the erection of court-houses and
similar buildings. It need not be explained to what lengths or into what
details Pharisaical punctiliousness carried all these ordinances.

From the New Testament we know, that to enter the house of a heathen
defiled till the evening (John 18:28), and that all familiar intercourse
with Gentiles was forbidden (Acts 10:28). So terrible was the
intolerance, that a Jewess was actually forbidden to give help to her
heathen neighbour, when about to become a mother (Avod. S. ii. 1)!

It was not a new question to St. Paul, when the Corinthians inquired
about the lawfulness of meat sold in the shambles or served up at a
feast (1 Cor 10:25,27,28). Evidently he had the Rabbinical law on the
subject before his mind, while, on the one hand, he avoided the
Pharisaical bondage of the letter, and, on the other, guarded against
either injuring one’s own conscience, or offending that of an on-looker.
For, according to Rabbi Akiba, “Meat which is about to be brought in
heathen worship is lawful, but that which comes out from it is
forbidden, because it is like the sacrifices of the dead” (Avod. S. ii.
3).

But the separation went much beyond what ordinary minds might be
prepared for. Milk drawn from a cow by heathen hands, bread and oil
prepared by them, might indeed be sold to strangers, but not used by
Israelites. No pious Jew would of course have sat down at the table of a
Gentile (Acts 11:3; Gal 2:12). If a heathen were invited to a Jewish
house, he might not be left alone in the room, else every article of
food or drink on the table was henceforth to be regarded as unclean. If
cooking utensils were bought of them, they had to be purified by fire or
by water; knives to be ground anew; spits to be made red-hot before use,
etc. It was not lawful to let either house or field, nor to sell cattle,
to a heathen; any article, however distantly connected with heathenism,
was to be destroyed. Thus, if a weaving-shuttle had been made of wood
grown in a grove devoted to idols, every web of cloth made by it was to
be destroyed; nay, if such pieces had been mixed with others, to the
manufacture of which no possible objection could have been taken, these
all became unclean, and had to be destroyed.

These are only general statements to show the prevalent feeling. It was
easy to prove how it pervaded every relationship of life. The heathens,
though often tolerant, of course retorted. Circumcision, the
Sabbath-rest, the worship of an invisible God, and Jewish abstinence
from pork, formed a never-ending theme of merriment to the heathen.
Conquerors are not often chary in disguising their contempt for the
conquered, especially when the latter presume to look down upon, and to
hate them. In view of all this, what an almost incredible truth must it
have seemed, when the Lord Jesus Christ proclaimed it among Israel as
the object of His coming and kingdom, not to make of the Gentiles Jews,
but of both alike children of one Heavenly Father; not to rivet upon the
heathen the yoke of the law, but to deliver from it Jew and Gentile, or
rather to fulfil its demands for all! The most unexpected and
unprepared-for revelation, from the Jewish point of view, was that of
the breaking down of the middle wall of partition between Jew and
Gentile, the taking away of the enmity of the law, and the nailing it to
His cross. There was nothing analogous to it; not a hint of it to be
found, either in the teaching or the spirit of the times. Quite the
opposite. Assuredly, the most unlike thing to Christ were His times; and
the greatest wonder of all–“the mystery hidden from ages and
generations”–the foundation of one universal Church.

Chapter 3. In Galilee at the Time of Our Lord
=============================================

“If any one wishes to be rich, let him go north; if he wants to be wise,
let him come south.” Such was the saying, by which Rabbinical pride
distinguished between the material wealth of Galilee and the supremacy
in traditional lore claimed for the academies of Judaea proper. Alas, it
was not long before Judaea lost even this doubtful distinction, and its
colleges wandered northwards, ending at last by the Lake of Gennesaret,
and in that very city of Tiberias which at one time had been reputed
unclean! Assuredly, the history of nations chronicles their judgment;
and it is strangely significant, that the authoritative collection of
Jewish traditional law, known as the Mishnah, and the so-called
Jerusalem Talmud, which is its Palestinian commentary,
<sup>**[<sup>11</sup>](#sdfootnote11sym)**</sup> should finally have
issued from what was originally a heathen city, built upon the site of
old forsaken graves.

But so long as Jerusalem and Judaea were the centre of Jewish learning,
no terms of contempt were too strong to express the supercilious
hauteur, with which a regular Rabbinist regarded his northern
co-religionists. The slighting speech of Nathanael (John 1:46), “Can
there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” reads quite like a common
saying of the period; and the rebuke of the Pharisees to Nicodemus (John
7:52), “Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet,” was
pointed by the mocking question, “Art thou also of Galilee?” It was not
merely self-conscious superiority, such as the “towns-people,” as the
inhabitants of Jerusalem used to be called throughout Palestine, were
said to have commonly displayed towards their “country cousins” and
every one else, but offensive contempt, outspoken sometimes with almost
incredible rudeness, want of delicacy and charity, but always with much
pious self-assertion.

The “God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men” (Luke 18:11) seems
like the natural breath of Rabbinism in the company of the unlettered,
and of all who were deemed intellectual or religious inferiors; and the
parabolic history of the Pharisee and the publican in the gospel is not
told for the special condemnation of that one prayer, but as
characteristic of the whole spirit of Pharisaism, even in its approaches
to God. “This people who knoweth not the law (that is, the traditional
law) are cursed,” was the curt summary of the Rabbinical estimate of
popular opinion. To so terrible a length did it go that the Pharisees
would fain have excluded them, not only from common intercourse, but
from witness-bearing, and that they even applied to marriages with them
such a passage as Deuteronomy 27:21.

But if these be regarded as extremes, two instances, chosen almost at
random–one from religious, the other from ordinary life–will serve to
illustrate their reality. A more complete parallel to the Pharisee’s
prayer could scarcely be imagined than the following. We read in the
Talmud (Jer. Ber, iv. 2) that a celebrated Rabbi was wont every day, on
leaving the academy, to pray in these terms:

“I thank Thee, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, that Thou hast cast
my lot among those who frequent the schools and synagogues, and not
among those who attend the theatre and the circus. For, both I and they
work and watch–I to inherit eternal life, they for their destruction.”

The other illustration, also taken from a Rabbinical work, is, if
possible, even more offensive. It appears that Rabbi Jannai, while
travelling by the way, formed acquaintance with a man, whom he thought
his equal. Presently his new friend invited him to dinner, and liberally
set before him meat and drink. But the suspicions of the Rabbi had been
excited. He began to try his host successively by questions upon the
text of Scripture, upon the Mishnah, allegorical interpretations, and
lastly on Talmudical lore. Alas! on neither of these points could he
satisfy the Rabbi. Dinner was over; and Rabbi Jannai, who by that time
no doubt had displayed all the hauteur and contempt of a regular
Rabbinist towards the unlettered, called upon his host, as customary, to
take the cup of thanksgiving, and return thanks. But the latter was
sufficiently humiliated to reply, with a mixture of Eastern deference
and Jewish modesty, “Let Jannai himself give thanks in his own house.”
“At any rate,” observed the Rabbi, “you can join with me”; and when the
latter had agreed to this, Jannai said, “A dog has eaten of the bread of
Jannai!”

Impartial history, however, must record a different judgment of the men
of Galilee from that pronounced by the Rabbis, and that even wherein
they were despised by those leaders in Israel. Some of their
peculiarities, indeed, were due to territorial circumstances. The
province of Galilee–of which the name might be rendered “circuit,” being
derived from a verb meaning “to move in a circle”–covered the ancient
possession of four tribes: Issachar, Zebulon, Naphtali, and Asher. The
name occurs already in the Old Testament (compare Josh 20:7; 1 Kings
9:11; 2 Kings 15:29; 1 Chron 6:76; and especially Isa 9:1). In the time
of Christ it stretched northwards to the possessions of Tyre on the one
side, and to Syria on the other; on the south it was bounded by
Samaria–Mount Carmel on the western, and the district of Scythopolis (in
the Decapolis) on the eastern side, being here landmarks; while the
Jordan and the Lake of Gennesaret formed the general eastern
boundary-line.

Thus regarded, it would include names to which such reminiscences attach
as “the mountains of Gilboa,” where “Israel and Saul fell down slain”;
little Hermon, Tabor, Carmel, and that great battle-field of Palestine,
the plain of Jezreel. Alike the Talmud and Josephus divide it into Upper
and Lower Galilee, between which the Rabbis insert the district of
Tiberias, as Middle Galilee. We are reminded of the history of Zaccheus
(Luke 19:4) by the mark which the Rabbis give to distinguish between
Upper and Lower Galilee–the former beginning “where sycamores cease to
grow.” The sycomore, which is a species of fig, must, of course, not be
confounded with our sycamore, and was a very delicate evergreen, easily
destroyed by cold (Psa 78:47), and growing only in the Jordan valley, or
in Lower Galilee up to the sea-coast. The mention of that tree may also
help us to fix the locality where Luke 17:6 was spoken by the Saviour.

The Rabbis mention Kefar Hananyah, probably the modern Kefr Anan, to the
north-west of Safed, as the first place in Upper Galilee. Safed was
truly “a city set on an hill”; and as such may have been in view of the
Lord, when He spoke the Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5:14). In the Talmud
it is mentioned by the name of Zephath, and spoken of as one of the
signal-stations, whence the proclamation of the new moon, made by the
Sanhedrim in Jerusalem (see The Temple), and with it the beginning of
every month, was telegraphed by fire-signals from hill to hill
throughout the land, and far away east of the Jordan, to those of the
dispersion.

The mountainous part in the north of Upper Galilee presented magnificent
scenery, with bracing air. Here the scene of the Song of Solomon is
partly laid (Cant 7:5). But its caves and fastnesses, as well as the
marshy ground, covered with reeds, along Lake Merom, gave shelter to
robbers, outlaws, and rebel chiefs. Some of the most dangerous
characters came from the Galilean highlands. A little farther down, and
the scenery changed. South of Lake Merom, where the so-called Jacob’s
bridge crosses the Jordan, we come upon the great caravan road, which
connected Damascus in the east with the great mart of Ptolemais, on the
shore of the Mediterranean.

What a busy life did this road constantly present in the days of our
Lord, and how many trades and occupations did it call into existence!
All day long they passed–files of camel, mules, and asses, laden with
the riches of the East, destined for the far West, or bringing the
luxuries of the West to the far East. Travellers of every
description–Jews, Greeks, Romans, dwellers in the East–were seen here.
The constant intercourse with foreigners, and the settlement of so many
strangers along one of the great highways of the world, must have
rendered the narrow-minded bigotry of Judaea well-nigh impossible in
Galilee.

We are now in Galilee proper, and a more fertile or beautiful region
could scarcely be conceived. It was truly the land where Asher dipped
his foot in oil (Deu 33:24). The Rabbis speak of the oil as flowing like
a river, and they say that it was easier in Galilee to rear a forest of
olive-trees than one child in Judaea! The wine, although not so
plentiful as the oil, was generous and rich. Corn grew in abundance,
especially in the neighbourhood of Capernaum; flax also was cultivated.
The price of living was much lower than in Judaea, where one measure was
said to cost as much as five in Galilee.

Fruit also grew to perfection; and it was probably a piece of jealousy
on the part of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that they would not allow
it to be sold at the feasts in the city, lest people should forsooth
say, “We have only come up in order to taste fruit from Galilee” (Pes. 8
b). Josephus speaks of the country in perfectly rapturous terms. He
counts no fewer than 240 towns and villages, and speaks of the smallest
as containing not less than 15,000 inhabitants! This, of course, must be
gross exaggeration, as it would make the country more than twice as
thickly populated as the densest districts in England or Belgium.

Some one has compared Galilee to the manufacturing districts of this
country [England. wd]. This comparison, of course, applies only to the
fact of its busy life, although various industries were also carried on
there–large potteries of different kinds, and dyeworks. From the heights
of Galilee the eye would rest on harbours, filled with merchant ships,
and on the sea, dotted with white sails. There, by the shore, and also
inland, smoked furnaces, where glass was made; along the great road
moved the caravans; in field, vineyard, and orchard all was activity.
The great road quite traversed Galilee, entering it where the Jordan is
crossed by the so-called bridge of Jacob, then touching Capernaum, going
down to Nazareth, and passing on to the sea-coast. This was one
advantage that Nazareth had–that it lay on the route of the world’s
traffic and intercourse.

Another peculiarity is strangely unknown to Christian writers. It
appears from ancient Rabbinical writings that Nazareth was one of the
stations of the priests. All the priests were divided into twenty-four
courses, one of which was always on ministry in the Temple. Now, the
priests of the course which was to be on duty always gathered in certain
towns, whence they went up in company to the Temple; those who were
unable to go spending the week in fasting and prayer for their brethren.
Nazareth was one of these priestly centres; so that there, with symbolic
significance, alike those passed who carried on the traffic of the
world, and those who ministered in the Temple.

We have spoken of Nazareth; and a few brief notices of other places in
Galilee, mentioned in the New Testament, may be of interest. Along the
lake lay, north, Capernaum, a large city; and near it, Chorazin, so
celebrated for its grain, that, if it had been closer to Jerusalem, it
would have been used for the Temple; also Bethsaida,
<sup>**[<sup>12</sup>](#sdfootnote12sym)**</sup> the name, “house of
fishes,” indicating its trade.

Capernaum was the station where Matthew sat at the receipt of custom
(Matt 9:9). South of Capernaum was Magdala, the city of dyers, the home
of Mary Magdalene (Mark 15:40, 16:1; Luke 8:2; John 20:1). The Talmud
mentions its shops and its woolworks, speaks of its great wealth, but
also of the corruption of its inhabitants. Tiberias, which had been
built shortly before Christ, is only incidentally mentioned in the New
Testament (John 6:1,23, 21:1). At the time it was a splendid but chiefly
heathen city, whose magnificent buildings contrasted with the more
humble dwellings common in the country.

Quite at the southern end of the lake was Tarichaea, the great fishing
place, whence preserved fish was exported in casks (Strabo, xvi, 2). It
was there that, in the great Roman war, a kind of naval battle was
fought, which ended in terrible slaughter, no quarter being given by the
Romans, so that the lake was dyed red with the blood of the victims, and
the shore rendered pestilential by their bodies. Cana in Galilee was the
birthplace of Nathanael (John 21:2), where Christ performed His first
miracle (John 2:1-11); significant also in connection with the second
miracle there witnessed, when the new wine of the kingdom was first
tasted by Gentile lips (John 4:46,47). Cana lay about three hours to the
north-north-east of Nazareth. Lastly, Nain was one of the southernmost
places in Galilee, not far from the ancient Endor.

It can scarcely surprise us, however interesting it may prove, that such
Jewish recollections of the early Christians as the Rabbis have
preserved, should linger chiefly around Galilee. Thus we have, in quite
the apostolic age, mention of miraculous cures made, in the name of
Jesus, by one Jacob of Chefar Sechanja (in Galilee), one of the Rabbis
violently opposing on one occasion an attempt of the kind, the patient
meanwhile dying during the dispute; repeated records of discussions with
learned Christians, and other indications of contact with Hebrew
believers.

Some have gone farther, and found traces of the general spread of such
views in the fact that a Galilean teacher is introduced in Babylon as
propounding the science of the Merkabah, or the mystical doctrines
connected with Ezekiel’s vision of the Divine chariot, which certainly
contained elements closely approximating the Christian doctrines of the
Logos, the Trinity, etc. Trinitarian views have also been suspected in
the significance attached to the number “three” by a Galilean teacher of
the third century, in this wise: “Blessed be God, who has given the
three laws (the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa) to a
people composed of three classes (Priests, Levites, and laity), through
him who was the youngest of three (Miriam, Aaron, and Moses), on the
third day (of their separation–Exo 19:16), and in the third month.”

There is yet another saying of a Galilean Rabbi, referring to the
resurrection, which, although far from clear, may bear a Christian
application. Finally, the Midrash applies the expression, “The sinner
shall be taken by her” (Eccl 7:26), either to the above-named Christian
Rabbi Jacob, or to Christians generally, or even to Capernaum, with
evident reference to the spread of Christianity there. We cannot here
pursue this very interesting subject farther than to say, that we find
indications of Jewish Christians having endeavoured to introduce their
views while leading the public devotions of the Synagogue, and even of
contact with the immoral heretical sect of the Nicolaitans (Rev 2:15).

Indeed, what we know of the Galileans would quite prepare us for
expecting, that the gospel should have received at least a ready hearing
among many of them. It was not only, that Galilee was the great scene of
our Lord’s working and teaching, and the home of His first disciples and
apostles; nor yet that the frequent intercourse with strangers must have
tended to remove narrow prejudices, while the contempt of the Rabbinists
would loosen attachment to the strictest Pharisaism; but, as the
character of the people is described to us by Josephus, and even by the
Rabbis, they seem to have been a warm-hearted, impulsive, generous
race–intensely national in the best sense, active, not given to idle
speculations or wire-drawn logico-theological distinctions, but
conscientious and earnest.

The Rabbis detail certain theological differences between Galilee and
Judaea. Without here mentioning them, we have no hesitation in saying,
that they show more earnest practical piety and strictness of life, and
less adherence to those Pharisaical distinctions which so often made
void the law.

The Talmud, on the other hand, charges the Galileans with neglecting
traditionalism; learning from one teacher, then from another (perhaps
because they had only wandering Rabbis, not fixed academies); and with
being accordingly unable to rise to the heights of Rabbinical
distinctions and explanations. That their hot blood made them rather
quarrelsome, and that they lived in a chronic state of rebellion against
Rome, we gather not only from Josephus, but even from the New Testament
(Luke 13:2; Acts 5:37).

Their poor pronunciation of Hebrew, or rather their inability properly
to pronounce the gutturals, formed a constant subject of witticism and
reproach, so current that even the servants in the High Priest’s palace
could turn round upon Peter, and say, “Surely thou also art one of them;
for thy speech betrayeth thee” (Matt 26:73)–a remark this, by the way,
which illustrates the fact that the language commonly used at the time
of Christ in Palestine was Aramaean, not Greek. Josephus describes the
Galileans as hard-working, manly, and brave; and even the Talmud admits
(Jer. Cheth. iv. 14) that they cared more for honour than for money.

But the district in Galilee to which the mind ever reverts, is that
around the shores of its lake.
<sup>**[<sup>13</sup>](#sdfootnote13sym)**</sup> Its beauty, its
marvellous vegetation, its almost tropical products, its wealth and
populousness, have been often described. The Rabbis derive the name of
Gennesaret either from a harp–because the fruits of its shores were as
sweet as is the sound of a harp–or else explain it to mean “the gardens
of the princes,” from the beautiful villas and gardens around.

But we think chiefly not of those fertile fields and orchards, nor of
the deep blue of the lake, enclosed between hills, nor of the busy
towns, nor of the white sails spread on its waters–but of Him, Whose
feet trod its shores; Who taught, and worked, and prayed there for us
sinners; Who walked its waters and calmed its storms, and Who even after
His resurrection held there sweet converse with His disciples; nay,
Whose last words on earth, spoken from thence, come to us with peculiar
significance and application, as in these days we look on the disturbing
elements in the world around: “What is that to thee? Follow thou Me”
(John 21:22).

Chapter 4. Travelling, Roads, Inns, Hospitality, Taxation, Publicans
====================================================================

It was the very busiest road in Palestine, on which the publican Levi
Matthew sat at the receipt of “custom,” when our Lord called him to the
fellowship of the Gospel, and he then made that great feast to which he
invited his fellow-publicans, that they also might see and hear Him in
Whom he had found life and peace (Luke 5:29). For, it was the only truly
international road of all those which passed through Palestine; indeed,
it formed one of the great highways of the world’s commerce. At the time
of which we write, it may be said, in general, that six main arteries of
commerce and intercourse traversed the country, the chief objective
points being Caesarea, the military, and Jerusalem, the religious
capital.

First, there was the southern road, which led from Jerusalem, by
Bethlehem, to Hebron, and thence westwards to Gaza, and eastwards into
Arabia, whence also a direct road went northwards to Damascus. It is by
this road we imagine St. Paul to have travelled, when retiring into the
solitudes of Arabia, immediately after his conversion (Gal 1:17,18). The
road to Hebron must have been much frequented by priestly and other
pilgrims to the city, and by it the father of the Baptist and the
parents of Jesus would pass.

Secondly, there was the old highway along the sea-shore from Egypt up to
Tyre, whence a straight, but not so much frequented, road struck, by
Caesarea Philippi, to Damascus. But the sea-shore road itself, which
successively touched Gaza, Ascalon, Jamnia, Lydda, Diospolis, and
finally Caesarea and Ptolemais, was probably the most important military
highway in the land, connecting the capital with the seat of the Roman
procurator at Caesarea, and keeping the sea-board and its harbours free
for communication. This road branched off for Jerusalem at Lydda, where
it bifurcated, leading either by Beth-horon or by Emmaus, which was the
longer way. It was probably by this road that the Roman escort hurried
off St. Paul (Acts 23:31), the mounted soldiers leaving him at
Antipatris, about twenty Roman miles from Lydda, and altogether from
Jerusalem about fifty-two Roman miles (the Roman mile being 1,618 yards,
the English mile 1,760).

Thus the distance to Caesarea, still left to be traversed next morning
by the cavalry would be about twenty-six Roman miles, or, the whole way,
seventy-eight Roman miles from Jerusalem. This rate of travelling,
though rapid, cannot be regarded as excessive, since an ordinary day’s
journey is computed in the Talmud (Pes 93b) as high as forty Roman
miles.

A third road led from Jerusalem, by Beth-horon and Lydda, to Joppa,
whence it continued close by the sea-shore to Caesarea. This was the
road which Peter and his companions would take when summoned to go and
preach the gospel to Cornelius (Acts 10:23,24). It was at Lydda,
thirty-two Roman miles from Jerusalem, that Aeneas was miraculously
healed, and “nigh” to it–within a few miles–was Joppa, where the raising
of Tabitha, Dorcas, “the gazelle” (Acts 9:32-43), took place.

Of the fourth great highway, which led from Galilee to Jerusalem,
straight through Samaria, branching at Sichem eastwards to Damascus, and
westwards to Caesarea, it is needless to say much, since, although much
shorter, it was, if possible, eschewed by Jewish travellers; though,
both in going to (Luke 9:53, 17:11), and returning from Jerusalem (John
4:4,43), the Lord Jesus passed that way. The road from Jerusalem
straight northwards also branched off at Gophna, whence it led across to
Diospolis, and so on to Caesarea.

But ordinarily, Jewish travellers would, rather than pass through
Samaria, face the danger of robbers which awaited them (Luke 10:30)
along the fifth great highway (comp. Luke 19:1,28; Matt 20:17,29), that
led from Jerusalem, by Bethany, to Jericho. Here the Jordan was forded,
and the road led to Gilead, and thence either southwards, or else north
to Peraea, whence the traveller could make his way into Galilee. It will
be observed that all these roads, whether commercial or military, were,
so to speak, Judaean, and radiated from or to Jerusalem. But the sixth
and great road, which passed through Galilee, was not at all primarily
Jewish, but connected the East with the West–Damascus with Rome. From
Damascus it led across the Jordan to Capernaum, Tiberias, and Nain
(where it fell in with a direct road from Samaria), to Nazareth, and
thence to Ptolemais. Thus, from its position, Nazareth was on the
world’s great highway. What was spoken there might equally re-echo
throughout Palestine, and be carried to the remotest lands of the East
and of the West.

It need scarcely be said, that the roads which we have thus traced are
only those along the principal lines of communication. But a large
number of secondary roads also traversed the country in all directions.
Indeed, from earliest times much attention seems to have been given to
facility of intercourse throughout the land. Even in the days of Moses
we read of “the king’s highway” (Num 20:17,19, 21:22). In Hebrew we
have, besides the two general terms (derech and orach), three
expressions which respectively indicate a trodden or beaten-down path
(nathiv, from nathav, to tread down), a made or cast-up road (messillah,
from salal, to cast up), and “the king’s highway”–the latter, evidently
for national purposes, and kept up at the public expense. In the time of
the kings (for example, 1 Kings 12:18), and even earlier, there were
regular carriage roads, although we can scarcely credit the statement of
Josephus (Antiq, viii, 7, 4), that Solomon had caused the principal
roads to be paved with black stone–probably basalt. Toll was apparently
levied in the time of Ezra (Ezra 4:13,20); but the clergy were exempt
from this as from all other taxation (7:24). The roads to the cities of
refuge required to be always kept in good order (Deu 19:3). According to
the Talmud they were to be forty-eight feet wide, and provided with
bridges, and with sign-posts where roads diverged.

Passing to later times, the Romans, as might have been expected, paid
great attention to the modes of communication through the country. The
military roads were paved, and provided with milestones. But the country
roads were chiefly bridle-paths. The Talmud distinguishes between public
and private roads. The former must be twenty-four, the latter six feet
wide. It is added that, for the king’s highway, and for the road taken
by funerals, there is no measure (Babba B. vi. 7). Roads were annually
repaired in spring, preparatory for going up to the great feasts.

To prevent the possibility of danger, no subterranean structure, however
protected, was allowed under a public road. Overhanging branches of
trees had to be cut down, so as to allow a man on a camel to pass. A
similar rule applied to balconies and projections; nor were these
permitted to darken a street. Any one allowing things to accumulate on
the road, or dropping them from a cart, had to make good what damage
might be incurred by travellers. Indeed, in towns and their
neighbourhood the police regulations were even more strict; and such
ordinances occur as for the removal within thirty days of rotten trees
or dangerous walls; not to pour out water on the road; not to throw out
anything on the street, nor to leave about building materials, or broken
glass, or thorns, along with other regulations for the public safety and
health.

Along such roads passed the travellers; few at first, and mostly
pilgrims, but gradually growing in number, as commerce and social or
political intercourse increased. Journeys were performed on foot, upon
asses, or in carriages (Acts 8:28), of which three kinds are
mentioned–the round carriage, perhaps like our gig; the elongated, like
a bed; and the cart, chiefly for the transport of goods. It will be
understood that in those days travelling was neither comfortable nor
easy. Generally, people journeyed in company, of which the festive bands
going to Jerusalem are a well-known instance. If otherwise, one would
prepare for a journey almost as for a change of residence, and provide
tent, victuals, and all that was needful by the way. It was otherwise
with the travelling hawker, who was welcomed as a friend in every
district through which he passed, who carried the news of the day,
exchanged the products of one for those of another district, and
produced the latest articles of commerce or of luxury. Letters were only
conveyed by special messengers, or through travellers.

In such circumstances, the command, “Be not forgetful to entertain
strangers,” had a special meaning. Israel was always distinguished for
hospitality; and not only the Bible, but the Rabbis, enjoin this in the
strongest terms. In Jerusalem no man was to account a house as only his
own; and it was said, that during the pilgrim-feasts none ever wanted
ready reception. The tractate Aboth (1.5), mentions these as two out of
the three sayings of Jose, the son of Jochanan, of Jerusalem: “Let thy
house be wide open, and let the poor be the children of thy house.”

Readers of the New Testament will be specially interested to know, that,
according to the Talmud (Pes. 53), Bethphage and Bethany, to which in
this respect such loving memories cling, were specially celebrated for
their hospitality towards the festive pilgrims. In Jerusalem it seems to
have been the custom to hang a curtain in front of the door, to indicate
that there was still room for guests. Some went so far as to suggest,
there should be four doors to every house, to bid welcome to travellers
from all directions. The host would go to meet an expected guest, and
again accompany him part of the way (Acts 21:5). The Rabbis declared
that hospitality involved as great, and greater merit than early morning
attendance in an academy of learning. They could scarcely have gone
farther, considering the value they attached to study. Of course, here
also the Rabbinical order had the preference; and hospitably to
entertain a sage, and to send him away with presents, was declared as
meritorious as to have offered the daily sacrifices (Ber. 10, b).

But let there be no misunderstanding. So far as the duty of hospitality
is concerned, or the loving care for poor and sick, it were impossible
to take a higher tone than that of Rabbinism. Thus it was declared, that
“the entertainment of travellers was as great a matter as the reception
of the Shechinah.” This gives a fresh meaning to the admonition of the
Epistle addressed specially to the Hebrews (13:2): “Be not forgetful to
entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.”
Bearing on this subject, one of the oldest Rabbinical commentaries has a
very beautiful gloss on Psalm 109:31: “He shall stand at the right hand
of the poor.”

“Whenever,” we read, “a poor man stands at thy door, the Holy One,
blessed be His Name, stands at his right hand. If thou givest him alms,
know that thou shalt receive a reward from Him who standeth at his right
hand.” In another commentary God Himself and His angels are said to
visit the sick. The Talmud itself counts hospitality among the things of
which the reward is received alike in this life and in that which is to
come (Shab. 127 a), while in another passage (Sot. 14 a) we are bidden
imitate God in these four respects: He clothed the naked (Gen 3:21); He
visited the sick (Gen 18:1); He comforted the mourners (Gen 25:11); and
He buried the dead (Deu 34:6).

In treating of hospitality, the Rabbis display, as in so many relations
of life, the utmost tenderness and delicacy, mixed with a delightful
amount of shrewd knowledge of the world and quaint humour. As a rule,
they enter here also into full details. Thus the very manner in which a
host is to bear himself towards his guests is prescribed. He is to look
pleased when entertaining his guests, to wait upon them himself, to
promise little and to give much, etc. At the same time it was also
caustically added: “Consider all men as if they were robbers, but treat
them as if each were Rabbi Gamaliel himself!”

On the other hand, rules of politeness and gratitude are equally laid
down for the guests. “Do not throw a stone,” it was said, “into the
spring at which you have drunk” (Baba K,. 92); or this, “A proper guest
acknowledges all, and saith, ‘At what trouble my host has been, and all
for my sake!’–while an evil visitor remarks: ‘Bah! what trouble has he
taken?’ Then, after enumerating how little he has had in the house, he
concludes; ‘And, after all, it was not done for me, but only for his
wife and children!’” (Ber. 58 a). Indeed, some of the sayings in this
connection are remarkably parallel to the directions which our Lord gave
to His disciples on going forth upon their mission (Luke 10:5-11, and
parallels). Thus, one was to inquire for the welfare of the family; not
to go from house to house; to eat of such things as were set before one;
and, finally, to part with a blessing.

All this, of course, applied to entertainment in private families. On
unfrequented roads, where villages were at great intervals, or even
outside towns (Luke 2:7), there were regular khans, or places of
lodgment for strangers. Like the modern khans, these places were open,
and generally built in a square, the large court in the middle being
intended for the beasts of burden or carriages, while rooms opened upon
galleries all around. Of course these rooms were not furnished, nor was
any payment expected from the wayfarer.

At the same time, some one was generally attached to the khan–mostly a
foreigner–who would for payment provide anything that might be needful,
of which we have an instance in the parabolic history of the Good
Samaritan (Luke 10:35). Such hostelries are mentioned so early as in the
history of Moses (Gen 42:27; 43:21). Jeremiah calls them “a place for
strangers” (Jer 41:17), wrongly rendered “habitation” in our Authorised
Version. In the Talmud their designations are either Greek or Latin, in
Aramaic form–one of them being the same as that used in Luke
10:34–proving that such places were chiefly provided by and for
strangers. <sup>**[<sup>14</sup>](#sdfootnote14sym)**</sup>

In later times we also read of the oshpisa–evidently from hospitium, and
showing its Roman origin–as a house of public entertainment, where such
food as locusts, pickled, or fried in flour or in honey, and Median or
Babylonian beer, Egyptian drink, and home-made cider or wine, were sold;
such proverbs circulating among the boon companions as “To eat without
drinking is like devouring one’s own blood” (Shab. 41 a), and where wild
noise and games of chance were indulged in by those who wasted their
substance by riotous living. In such places the secret police, whom
Herod employed, would ferret out the opinions of the populace while over
their cups.

Police must have been largely employed. According to Josephus (Anti. xv,
366) spies beset the people, alike in town and country, watching their
conversations in the unrestrained confidence of friendly intercourse.
Herod himself is said to have acted in that capacity, and to have lurked
about the streets at night-time in disguise to overhear or entrap unwary
citizens. Indeed, at one time the city seems almost to have been under
martial law, the citizens being forbidden “to meet together, to walk or
eat together,”–presumably to hold public meetings, demonstrations, or
banquets.

History sufficiently records what terrible vengeance followed the
slightest suspicion. The New Testament account of the murder of all the
little children at Bethlehem (Matt 2:16), in hope of destroying among
them the royal scion of David, is thoroughly in character with all that
we know of Herod and his reign. There is at last indirect confirmation
of this narrative in Talmudical writings, as there is evidence that all
the genealogical registers in the Temple were destroyed by order of
Herod. This is a most remarkable fact. The Jews retaliated by an
intensity of hatred which went so far as to elevate the day of Herod’s
death (2 Shebet) into an annual feast-day, on which all mourning was
prohibited.

But whether passing through town or country, by quiet side-roads or
along the great highway, there was one sight and scene which must
constantly have forced itself upon the attention of the traveller, and,
if he were of Jewish descent, would ever awaken afresh his indignation
and hatred. Whithersoever he went, he encountered in city or country the
well-known foreign tax-gatherer, and was met by his insolence, by his
vexatious intrusion, and by his exactions. The fact that he was the
symbol of Israel’s subjection to foreign domination, galling though it
was, had probably not so much to do with the bitter hatred of the
Rabbinists towards the class of tax-farmers (Moches) and tax-collectors
(Gabbai), both of whom were placed wholly outside the pale of Jewish
society, as that they were so utterly shameless and regardless in their
unconscientious dealings.

For, ever since their return from Babylon, the Jews must, with a brief
interval, have been accustomed to foreign taxation. At the time of Ezra
(Ezra 4:13,20, 7:24) they paid to the Persian monarch “toll, tribute,
and custom”–middah, belo, and halach–or rather “ground-tax” (income and
property-tax?), “custom” (levied on all that was for consumption, or
imported), and “toll,” or road-money. Under the reign of the Ptolemies
the taxes seem to have been farmed to the highest bidder, the price
varying from eight to sixteen talents–that is, from about 3,140 pounds
to about 6,280 pounds–a very small sum indeed, which enabled the
Palestine tax-farmers to acquire immense wealth, and that although they
had continually to purchase arms and court favour (Josephus, Ant. xii,
154-185).

During the Syrian rule the taxes seem to have consisted of tribute, duty
on salt, a third of the produce of all that was sown, and one-half of
that from fruit-trees, besides poll-tax, custom duty, and an uncertain
kind of tax, called “crown-money” (the aurum coronarium of the Romans),
originally an annual gift of a crown of gold, but afterwards compounded
for in money (Josephus,Ant. xii, 129-137). Under the Herodians the royal
revenue seems to have been derived from crown lands, from a property and
income-tax, from import and export duties, and from a duty on all that
was publicly sold and bought, to which must be added a tax upon houses
in Jerusalem.

Heavily as these exactions must have weighed upon a comparatively poor
and chiefly agricultural population, they refer only to civil taxation,
not to religious dues (see The Temple). But, even so, we have not
exhausted the list of contributions demanded of a Jew. For, every town
and community levied its own taxes for the maintenance of synagogue,
elementary schools, public baths, the support of the poor, the
maintenance of public roads, city walls, and gates, and other general
requirements. It must, however, be admitted that the Jewish authorities
distributed this burden of civic taxation both easily and kindly, and
that they applied the revenues derived from it for the public welfare in
a manner scarcely yet attained in the most civilized countries. The
Rabbinical arrangements for public education, health, and charity were,
in every respect, far in advance of modern legislation, although here
also they took care themselves not to take the grievous burdens which
they laid upon others, by expressly exempting from civic taxes all those
who devoted themselves to the study of the law.

But the Roman taxation, which bore upon Israel with such crushing
weight, was quite of its own kind–systematic, cruel, relentless, and
utterly regardless. In general, the provinces of the Roman Empire, and
what of Palestine belonged to them, were subject to two great
taxes–poll-tax (or rather income-tax) and ground-tax. All property and
income that fell not under the ground-tax was subject to poll-tax; which
amounted, for Syria and Cilicia, to one per cent. The “poll-tax” was
really twofold, consisting of income-tax and head-money, the latter, of
course, the same in all cases, and levied on all persons (bond or free)
up to the age of sixty-five–women being liable from the age of twelve
and men from that of fourteen. Landed property was subject to a tax of
one-tenth of all grain, and one-fifth of the wine and fruit grown,
partly paid in product and partly commuted into money.
<sup>**[<sup>15</sup>](#sdfootnote15sym)**</sup>

Besides these, there was tax and duty on all imports and exports, levied
on the great public highways and in the seaports. Then there was
bridge-money and road-money, and duty on all that was bought and sold in
the towns. These, which may be called the regular taxes, were
irrespective of any forced contributions, and of the support which had
to be furnished to the Roman procurator and his household and court at
Caesarea. To avoid all possible loss to the treasury, the proconsul of
Syria, Quirinus (Cyrenius), had taken a regular census to show the
number of the population and their means. This was a terrible crime in
the eyes of the Rabbis, who remembers that, if numbering the people had
been reckoned such great sin of old, the evil must be an hundredfold
increased, if done by heathens and for their own purposes.

Another offence lay in the thought, that tribute, hitherto only given to
Jehovah, was now to be paid to a heathen emperor. “Is it lawful to pay
tribute unto Caesar?” was a sore question, which many an Israelite put
to himself as he placed the emperor’s poll-tax beside the half-shekel of
the sanctuary, and the tithe of his field, vineyard, and orchard,
claimed by the tax-gatherer, along with that which he had hitherto only
given unto the Lord. Even the purpose with which this inquiry was
brought before Christ–to entrap Him in a political denunciation–shows,
how much it was agitated among patriotic Jews; and it cost rivers of
blood before it was not answered, but silenced.

The Romans had a peculiar way of levying these taxes–not directly, but
indirectly–which kept the treasury quite safe, whatever harm it might
inflict on the taxpayer, while at the same time it threw upon him the
whole cost of the collection. Senators and magistrates were prohibited
from engaging in business or trade; but the highest order, the
equestrian, was largely composed of great capitalists. These Roman
knights formed joint-stock companies, which bought at public auction the
revenues of a province at a fixed price, generally for five years. The
board had its chairman, or magister, and its offices at Rome. These were
the real Publicani, or publicans, who often underlet certain of the
taxes. The Publicani, or those who held from them, employed either
slaves or some of the lower classes in the country as tax-gatherers–the
publicans of the New Testament.

Similarly, all other imposts were farmed and collected; some of them
being very onerous, and amounting to an ad valorem duty of two and a
half, of five, and in articles of luxury even of twelve and a half per
cent. Harbour-dues were higher than ordinary tolls, and smuggling or a
false declaration was punished by confiscation of the goods. Thus the
publicans also levied import and export dues, bridge-toll, road-money,
town-dues, etc.; and, if the peaceable inhabitant, the tiller of the
soil, the tradesman, or manufacturer was constantly exposed to their
exactions, the traveller, the caravan, or the pedlar encountered their
vexatious presence at every bridge, along the road, and at the entrance
to cities.

Every bale had to be unloaded, and all its contents tumbled about and
searched; even letters were opened; and it must have taken more than
Eastern patience to bear their insolence and to submit to their “unjust
accusations” in arbitrarily fixing the return from land or income, or
the value of goods, etc. For there was no use appealing against them,
although the law allowed this, since the judges themselves were the
direct beneficiaries by the revenue; for they before whom accusations on
this score would have to be laid, belonged to the order of knights, who
were the very persons implicated in the farming of the revenue.

Of course, the joint-stock company of Publicani at Rome expected its
handsome dividends; so did the tax-gatherers in the provinces, and those
to whom they on occasions sublet the imposts. All wanted to make money
of the poor people; and the cost of the collection had of course to be
added to the taxation. We can quite understand how Zaccheus, one of the
supervisors of these tax-gatherers in the district of Jericho, which,
from its growth and export of balsam, must have yielded a large revenue,
should, in remembering his past life, have at once said: “If I have
taken anything from any man by false accusation”–or, rather, “Whatever I
have wrongfully exacted of any man.” For nothing was more common than
for the publican to put a fictitious value on property or income.

Another favourite trick of theirs was to advance the tax to those who
were unable to pay, and then to charge usurious interest on what had
thereby become a private debt. How summarily and harshly such debts were
exacted, appears from the New Testament itself. In Matthew 18:28 we read
of a creditor who, for the small debt of one hundred denars, seizes the
debtor by the throat in the open street, and drags him to prison; the
miserable man, in his fear of the consequences, in vain falling down at
his feet, and beseeching him to have patience, in not exacting immediate
full payment. What these consequences were, we learn from the same
parable, where the king threatens not only to sell off all that his
debtor has, but even himself, his wife, and children into slavery (v
25). And what short shrift such an unhappy man had to expect from “the
magistrate,” appears from the summary procedure, ending in imprisonment
till “the last mite” had been paid, described in Luke 12:58.

However, therefore, in far-off Rome, Cicero might describe the Publicani
as “the flower of knighthood, the ornament of the state, and the
strength of the republic,” or as “the most upright and respected men,”
the Rabbis in distant Palestine might be excused for their intense
dislike of “the publicans,” even although it went to the excess of
declaring them incapable of bearing testimony in a Jewish court of law,
of forbidding to receive their charitable gifts, or even to change money
out of their treasury (Baba K. x. 1), of ranking them not only with
harlots and heathens, but with highwaymen and murderers (Ned. iii. 4),
and of even declaring them excommunicate. Indeed, it was held lawful to
make false returns, to speak untruth, or almost to use any means to
avoid paying taxes (Ned. 27 b; 28 a). And about the time of Christ the
burden of such exactions must have been felt all the heavier on account
of a great financial crisis in the Roman Empire (in the year 33 or our
era), which involved so many in bankruptcy, and could not have been
without its indirect influence even upon distant Palestine.

Of such men–despised Galileans, unlettered fishermen, excommunicated
publicans–did the blessed Lord, in His self-humiliation, choose His
closest followers, His special apostles! What a contrast to the
Pharisaical notions of the Messiah and His kingdom! What a lesson to
show, that it was not “by might nor by power,” but by His Spirit, and
that God had chosen the base things of this world, and things that were
despised, to confound things that were mighty! Assuredly, this offers a
new problem, and one harder of solution than many others, to those who
would explain everything by natural causes. Whatever they may say of the
superiority of Christ’s teaching to account for his success, no religion
could ever have been more weighted; no popular cause could ever have
presented itself under more disadvantageous circumstances than did the
Gospel of Christ to the Jews of Palestine. Even from this point of view,
to the historical student familiar with the outer and inner life of that
period, there is no other explanation of the establishment of Christ’s
kingdom than the power of the Holy Ghost.

Such a custom-house officer was Matthew Levi, when the voice of our
Lord, striking to the inmost depths of his heart, summoned him to far
different work. It was a wonder that the Holy One should speak to such
an one as he; and oh! in what different accents from what had ever
fallen on his ears. But it was not merely condescension, kindness,
sympathy, even familiar intercourse with one usually regarded as a
social pariah; it was the closest fellowship; it was reception into the
innermost circle; it was a call to the highest and holiest work which
the Lord offered to Levi. And the busy road on which he sat to collect
customs and dues would now no more know the familiar face of Levi,
otherwise than as that of a messenger of peace, who brought glad tidings
of great joy.

Chapter 5. In Judea
===================

If Galilee could boast of the beauty of its scenery and the fruitfulness
of its soil; of being the mart of a busy life, and the highway of
intercourse with the great world outside Palestine, Judea would neither
covet nor envy such advantages. Hers was quite another and a peculiar
claim. Galilee might be the outer court, but Judaea was like the inner
sanctuary of Israel. True, its landscapes were comparatively barren, its
hills bare and rocky, its wilderness lonely; but around those grey
limestone mountains gathered the sacred history–one might almost say,
the romance and religion of Israel.

Turning his back on the luxurious richness of Galilee, the pilgrim, even
in the literal sense, constantly went up towards Jerusalem. Higher and
higher rose the everlasting hills, till on the uppermost he beheld the
sanctuary of his God, standing out from all around, majestic in the
snowy pureness of its marble and glittering gold. As the hum of busy
life gradually faded from his hearing, and he advanced into the solemn
stillness and loneliness, the well-known sites which he successively
passed must have seemed to wake the echoes of the history of his people.
First, he approached Shiloh, Israel’s earliest sanctuary, where,
according to tradition, the Ark had rested for 370 years less one. Next
came Bethel, with its sacred memorial of patriarchal history. There, as
the Rabbis had it, even the angel of death was shorn of his power. Then
he stood on the plateau of Ramah, with the neighbouring heights of
Gibeon and Gibeah, round which so many events in Jewish history had
clustered. In Ramah Rachel died, and was buried.
<sup>**[<sup>16</sup>](#sdfootnote16sym)**</sup>

We know that Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. Such is the reverence
of Orientals for the resting-places of celebrated historical personages,
that we may well believe it to have been the same pillar which,
according to an eye-witness, still marked the site at the time of our
Lord (Book of Jubil. cxxxii Apud Hausrath, Neutest. Zeitg. p. 26).
Opposite to it were the graves of Bilhah and of Dinah (c. p. 34). Only
five miles from Jerusalem, this pillar was, no doubt, a well-known
landmark. by this memorial of Jacob’s sorrow and shame had been the sad
meeting-place of the captives when about to be carried into Babylon (Jer
40:1). There was bitter wailing at parting from those left behind, and
in weary prospect of hopeless bondage, and still bitterer lamentation,
as in the sight of friends, relations and countrymen, the old and the
sick, the weakly, and women and children were pitilessly slaughtered,
not to encumber the conqueror’s homeward march. Yet a third time was
Rachel’s pillar, twice before the memorial of Israel’s sorrow and shame,
to re-echo her lamentation over yet sorer captivity and slaughter, when
the Idumaean Herod massacred her innocent children, in the hope of
destroying with them Israel’s King and Israel’s kingdom. Thus was her
cup of former bondage and slaughter filled, and the words of Jeremy the
prophet fulfilled, in which he had depicted Rachel’s sorrow over her
children (Matt 2:17,18).

But westward from those scenes, where the mountains shelved down, or
more abruptly descended towards the Shephelah, or wolds by the sea, were
the scenes of former triumphs. Here Joshua had pursued the kings of the
south; there Samson had come down upon the Philistines, and here for
long years had war been waged against the arch-enemy of Israel,
Philistia. Turning thence to the south, beyond the capital was royal
Bethlehem, and still farther the priest-city Hebron, with its caves
holding Israel’s most precious dust. That highland plateau was the
wilderness of Judaea, variously named from the villages which at long
distances dotted it; <sup>**[<sup>17</sup>](#sdfootnote17sym)**</sup>
desolate, lonely, tenanted only by the solitary shepherd, or the great
proprietor, like Nabal, whose sheep pastured along it heights and in its
glens.

This had long been the home of outlaws, or of those who, in disgust with
the world, had retired from its fellowship. These limestone caves had
been the hiding-place of David and his followers; and many a band had
since found shelter in these wilds. Here also John the Baptist prepared
for his work, and there, at the time of which we write, was the retreat
of the Essenes, whom a vain hope of finding purity in separation from
the world and its contact had brought to these solitudes.

Beyond, deep down in a mysterious hollow. stretched the smooth surface
of the Dead Sea, a perpetual memorial of God and of judgment. On its
western shore rose the castle which Herod had named after himself, and
farther south that almost inaccessible fastness of Masada, the scene of
the last tragedy in the great Jewish war. Yet from the wild desolateness
of the Dead Sea it was but a few hours to what seemed almost an earthly
paradise. Flanked and defended by four surrounding forts, lay the
important city of Jericho. Herod had built its walls, its theatre and
amphitheatre; Archelaus its new palace, surrounded by splendid gardens.

Through Jericho led the pilgrim way from Galilee, followed by our Lord
Himself (Luke 19:1); and there also passed the great caravan-road, which
connected Arabia with Damascus. The fertility of its soil, and its
tropical produce, were almost proverbial. Its palm-groves and gardens of
roses, but especially its balsam-plantations, of which the largest was
behind the royal palace, were the fairy land of the old world. But this
also was only a source of gain to the hated foreigner. Rome had made it
a central station for the collection of tax and custom, known to us from
Gospel history as that by which the chief publican Zaccheus had gotten
his wealth. Jericho, with its general trade and its traffic in
balsam–not only reputed the sweetest perfume, but also a cherished
medicine in antiquity–was a coveted prize to all around. A strange
setting for such a gem were its surroundings.

There was the deep depression of the Arabah, through which the Jordan
wound, first with tortuous impetuosity, and then, as it neared the Dead
Sea, seemingly almost reluctant to lose its waters in that slimy mass
(Pliny, Hist. Nat. vi. 5, 2). Pilgrims, priests, traders, robbers,
anchorites, wild fanatics, such were the figures to be met on that
strange scene; and almost within hearing were the sacred sounds from the
Temple-mount in the distance.
<sup>**[<sup>18</sup>](#sdfootnote18sym)**</sup>

It might be so, as the heathen historian put it in regard to Judaea,
that no one could have wished for its own sake to wage serious warfare
for its possession (Strabo, Geogr. xvi. 2). The Jew would readily
concede this. It was not material wealth which attracted him hither,
although the riches brought into the Temple from all quarters of the
world ever attracted the cupidity of the Gentiles. To the Jew this was
the true home of his soul, the centre of his inmost life, the longing of
his heart. “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning,” sang they who sat by the rivers of Babylon, weeping as they
remembered Zion. “If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the
roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy” (Psa
137:5,6). It is from such pilgrim-psalms by the way as Psalm 84 or from
the Songs of Ascent to the Holy City (commonly known as the Psalms of
Degrees), that we learn the feelings of Israel, culminating in this
mingled outpouring of prayer and praise, with which they greeted the
city of their longings as first it burst on their view:

Jehovah hath chosen Zion;

He hath desired it for His habitation.

This is my rest for ever:

Here will I dwell, for I desire after it!

I will abundantly bless her provision:

I will satisfy her poor with bread.

I will also clothe her priests with salvation:

And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

There will I make the horn of David to bud:

I ordain a lamp for Mine anointed.

His enemies will I clothe with shame:

But upon himself shall his crown flourish.

Psalm 132:13-18

Words these, true alike in their literal and spiritual applications;
highest hopes which, for nigh two thousand years, have formed and still
form part of Israel’s daily prayer, when they plead: “Speedily cause
Thou ‘the Branch of David,’ Thy servant, to shoot forth, and exalt Thou
his horn through Thy salvation” (this is the fifteenth of the eighteen
“benedictions” in the daily prayers). Alas, that Israel knows not the
fulfilment of these hopes already granted and expressed in the
thanksgiving of the father of the Baptist: “Blessed be the Lord God of
Israel; for He hath visited and redeemed His people, and hath raised up
an horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David; as He
spake by the mouth of His holy prophets, which have been since the world
began” (Luke 1:68-70).

Such blessings, and much more, were not only objects of hope, but
realities alike to the Rabbinist and the unlettered Jew. They determined
him willingly to bend the neck under a yoke of ordinances otherwise
unbearable; submit to claims and treatment against which his nature
would otherwise have rebelled, endure scorn and persecutions which would
have broken any other nationality and crushed any other religion. To the
far exiles of the Dispersion, this was the one fold, with its promise of
good shepherding, of green pastures, and quiet waters.

Judaea was, so to speak, their Campo Santo, with the Temple in the midst
of it, as the symbol and prophecy of Israel’s resurrection. To stand, if
it were but once, within its sacred courts, to mingle with its
worshippers, to bring offerings, to see the white-robed throng of
ministering priests, to hear the chant of Levites, to watch the smoke of
sacrifices uprising to heaven–to be there, to take part in it was the
delicious dream of life, a very heaven upon earth, the earnest of
fulfilling prophecy. No wonder, that on the great feasts the population
of Jerusalem and of its neighbourhood, so far as reckoned within its
sacred girdle, swelled to millions, among whom were “devout men, out of
every nation under heaven” (Acts 2:5), or that treasure poured in from
all parts of the inhabited world. And this increasingly, as sign after
sign seemed to indicate that “the End” was nearing.

Surely the sands of the times of the Gentiles must have nearly run out.
The promised Messiah might at any moment appear and “restore the kingdom
to Israel.” From the statements of Josephus we know that the prophecies
of Daniel were specially resorted to, and a mass of the most
interesting, though tangled, apocalyptic literature, dating from that
period, shows what had been the popular interpretation of unfulfilled
prophecy. The oldest Jewish paraphrases of Scripture, or Targumim,
breathe the same spirit. Even the great heathen historians note this
general expectancy of an impending Jewish world-empire, and trace to it
the origin of the rebellions against Rome. Not even the allegorising
Jewish philosophers of Alexandria remained uninfluenced by the universal
hope.

Outside Palestine all eyes were directed towards Judaea, and each
pilgrim band on its return, or wayfaring brother on his journey, might
bring tidings of startling events. Within the land the feverish anxiety
of those who watched the scene not unfrequently rose to delirium and
frenzy. Only thus can we account for the appearance of so many false
Messiahs and for the crowds which, despite repeated disappointments,
were ready to cherish the most unlikely anticipations. It was thus that
a Theudas could persuade “a great part of the people” to follow him to
the brink of Jordan, in the hope of seeing its waters once more
miraculously divide, as before Moses, and an Egyptian impostor induce
them to go out to the Mount of Olives in the expectation of seeing the
walls of Jerusalem fall down at his command (Josephus, Ant. xx,
167-172).

Nay, such was the infatuation of fanaticism, that while the Roman
soldiers were actually preparing to set the Temple on fire, a false
prophet could assemble 6,000 men, women, and children, in its courts and
porches to await then and there a miraculous deliverance from heaven
(Josephus, Jewish War, vi, 287). Nor did even the fall of Jerusalem
quench these expectations, till a massacre, more terrible in some
respects than that at the fall of Jerusalem, extinguished in blood the
last public Messianic rising against Rome under Bar Cochba.

For, however misdirected–so far as related to the person of the Christ
and the nature of His kingdom–not to the fact or time of His coming, nor
yet to the character of Rome–such thoughts could not be uprooted
otherwise than with the history and religion of Israel. The New
Testament process upon them, as well as the Old; Christians and Jews
alike cherished them. In the language of St. Paul, this was “the hope of
the promise made of God unto our fathers: unto which our twelve tribes,
instantly serving God day and night, hope to come” (Acts 26:6,7).

It was this which sent the thrill of expectancy through the whole
nation, and drew crowds to Jordan, when an obscure anchorite, who did
not even pretend to attest his mission by any miracle, preached
repentance in view of the near coming of the kingdom of God. It was this
which turned all eyes to Jesus of Nazareth, humble and unpretending as
were His origin, His circumstances, and His followers, and which
diverted the attention of the people even from the Temple to the far-off
lake of despised Galilee.

And it was this which opened every home to the messengers whom Christ
sent forth, by two and two, and even after the Crucifixion, every
synagogue, to the apostles and preachers from Judaea. The title “Son of
man” was familiar to those who had drawn their ideas of the Messiah from
the well-known pages of Daniel. The popular apocalyptic literature of
the period, especially the so-called “Book of Enoch,” not only kept this
designation in popular memory, but enlarged on the judgment which He was
to execute on Gentile kings and nations."
<sup>**[<sup>19</sup>](#sdfootnote19sym)**</sup> “Wilt Thou at this time
restore the kingdom to Israel?” was a question out of the very heart of
Israel.

Even John the Baptist, in the gloom of his lonely prison, staggered not
at the person of the Messiah, but at the manner in which He seemed to
found His kingdom. <sup>**[<sup>20</sup>](#sdfootnote20sym)**</sup> He
had expected to hear the blows of that axe which he had lifted fall upon
the barren tree, and had to learn that the innermost secret of that
kingdom–carried not in earthquake of wrath, nor in whirlwind of
judgment, but breathed in the still small voice of love and pity–was
comprehension, not exclusion; healing, not destruction.

As for the Rabbis, the leaders of public opinion, their position towards
the kingdom was quite different. Although in the rising of Bar Cochab
the great Rabbi Akiba acted as the religious standard-bearer, he may be
looked upon as almost an exception. His character was that of an
enthusiast, his history almost a romance. But, in general, the Rabbis
did not identify themselves with the popular Messianic expectations.
Alike the Gospel-history and their writings show not merely that
anti-spiritual opposition to the Church which we might have expected,
but coldness and distance in regard to all such movements. Legal
rigorism and merciless bigotry are not fanaticism. The latter is chiefly
the impulse of the ill-informed. Even their contemptuous turning away
from “this people which knoweth not the law,” as “accursed,” proves them
incapable of a fanaticism which recognises a brother in every one whose
heart burns with the same fire, no matter what his condition otherwise.

The great textbook of Rabbinism, the Mishnah, is almost entirely
un-Messianic, one might say un-dogmatical. The method of the Rabbis was
purely logical. Where not a record of facts or traditions, the Mishnah
is purely a handbook of legal determinations in their utmost logical
sequences, only enlivened by discussions or the tale of instances in
point. The whole tendency of this system was anti-Messianic. Not but
that in souls so devout and natures so ardent enthusiasm might be
kindled, but that all their studies and pursuits went in the contrary
direction. Besides, they knew full well how little of power was left
them, and they dreaded losing even this.

The fear of Rome constantly haunted them. Even at the destruction of
Jerusalem the leading Rabbis aimed to secure their safety, and their
after history shows, frequently recurring, curious instances of
Rabbinical intimacy with their Roman oppressors. The Sanhedrim spoke
their inmost apprehensions, when in that secret session they determined
to kill Jesus from fear that, if He were allowed to go on, and all men
were to believe on Him, the Romans would come and take away both their
place and nation (John 11:48). Yet not one candid mind among them
discussed the reality of His miracles; not one generous voice was raised
to assert the principle of the Messiah’s claims and kingdom, even though
they had rejected those of Jesus of Nazareth! The question of the
Messiah might come up as a speculative point; it might force itself upon
the attention of the Sanhedrim; but it was not of personal, practical,
life-interest to them. It may mark only one aspect of the question, and
that an extreme one, yet even as such it is characteristic, when a Rabbi
could assert that “between the present and the days of the Messiah there
was only this difference, Israel’s servitude.”

Quite other matters engrossed the attention of the Rabbis. It was the
present and the past, not the future, which occupied them–the present as
fixing all legal determinations, and the past as giving sanction to
this. Judaea proper was the only place where the Shechinah had dwelt,
the land where Jehovah had caused His temple to be reared, the seat of
the Sanhedrim, the place where alone learning and real piety were
cultivated. From this point of view everything was judged. Judaea was
“grain, Galilee straw, and beyond Jordan chaff.”

To be a Judaean was to be “an Hebrew of the Hebrews.” It has already
been stated what reproach the Rabbis attached to Galilee in regard to
its language, manners, and neglect of regular study. In some respects
the very legal observances, as certainly social customs, were different
in Judaea from Galilee. Only in Judaea could Rabbis be ordained by the
laying on of hands; only there could the Sanhedrim in solemn session
declare and proclaim the commencement of each month, on which the
arrangement of the festive calendar depended.

Even after the stress of political necessity had driven the Rabbis to
Galilee, they returned to Lydda for the purpose, and it needed a sharp
struggle before they transferred the privilege of Judaea to other
regions in the third century of our era (Jer. Sanh. i. 1, 18). The wine
for use in the Temple was brought exclusively from Judaea, not only
because it was better, but because the transport through Samaria would
have rendered it defiled. Indeed, the Mishnah mentions the names of the
five towns whence it was obtained. Similarly, the oil used was derived
either from Judaea, or, if from Peraea, the olives only were brought, to
be crushed in Jerusalem.

The question what cities were really Jewish was of considerable
importance, so far as concerned ritual questions, and it occupied the
earnest attention of the Rabbis. It is not easy to fix the exact
boundaries of Judaea proper towards the north-west. To include the
sea-shore in the province of Samaria is a popular mistake. It certainly
was never reckoned with it. According to Josephus (Jewish War, iii,
35-58) Judaea proper extended along the sea-shore as far north as
Ptolemais or Acco. The Talmud seems to exclude at least the northern
cities. In the New Testament there is a distinction made between
Caesarea and the province of Judaea (Acts 12:19, 21:10).

This affords one of the indirect evidences not only of the intimate
acquaintance of the writer with strictly Rabbinical views, but also of
the early date of the composition of the Book of Acts. For, at a later
period Caesarea was declared to belong to Judaea, although its harbour
was excluded from such privileges, and all east and west of it
pronounced “defiled.” Possibly, it may have been added to the cities of
Judaea, simply because afterwards so many celebrated Rabbis resided
there. The importance attaching to Caesarea in connection with the
preaching of the Gospel and the history of St. Paul, and the early and
flourishing Christian churches there established give fresh interest to
all notices of the place. Only those from Jewish sources can here engage
our attention.

It were out of place here to describe the political importance of
Caesarea, as the seat of the Roman power, or its magnificent harbour and
buildings, or its wealth and influence. In Jewish writings it bears the
same name by which we know it, though at times it is designated after
its fortifications (Migdal Shur, M. Zor, M. Nassi), or after its harbour
(Migdal Shina), once also by its ancient name, the tower of Straton. The
population consisted of a mixture of Jews, Greeks, Syrians, and
Samaritans, and tumults between them were the first signal of the great
Jewish war. The Talmud calls it “the capital of the kings.” As the seat
of the Roman power it was specially hateful to the Jews. Accordingly it
is designated as the “daughter of Edom–the city of abomination and
blasphemy,” although the district was, for its riches, called “the land
of life.”

As might be expected, constant difficulties arose between the Jewish and
Roman authorities in Caesarea, and bitter are the complaints against the
unrighteousness of heathen judges. We can readily understand, that to a
Jew Caesarea was the symbol of Rome, Rome of Edom–and Edom was to be
destroyed! In fact, in their view Jerusalem and Caesarea could not
really co-exist. It is in this sense that we account for the following
curious passage: “If you are told that Jerusalem and Caesarea are both
standing, or that they are both destroyed, believe it not; but if you
are told that one of them is destroyed and the other standing, then
believe it” (Gitt. 16 a; Meg. 6 a). It is interesting to know that on
account of the foreign Jews resident in Caesarea, the Rabbis allowed the
principal prayers to be said in Greek, as being the vernacular; and
that, from the time of the evangelist Philip, good work was done for
Christ among its resident Jews. Indeed, Jewish writings contain special
notice of controversies there between Jews and Christians.

A brief summary of Jewish notices of certain other towns in Judaea,
mentioned also in the New Testament, may throw some additional light on
the sacred narratives. In general, the Mishnah divided Judaea proper
into three parts–mountain, Shephelah, and valley (Shev. ix 2), to which
we must add the city of Jerusalem as a separate district. And here we
have another striking evidence of the authenticity of the New Testament,
and especially of the writings of St. Luke. Only one intimately
acquainted with the state of matters at the time would, with the Rabbis,
have distinguished Jerusalem as a district separate from all the rest of
Judaea, as St. Luke markedly does on several occasions (Luke 5:17; Acts
1:8, 10:39).

When the Rabbis speak of “the mountain,” they refer to the district
north-east and north of Jerusalem, also known as “the royal mount.” The
Shephelah, of course, is the country along the sea-shore. All the rest
is included in the term “valley.” It need scarcely be explained that, as
the Jerusalem Talmud tells us, this is merely a general classification,
which must not be too closely pressed. Of the eleven toparchies into
which, according to Josephus (Pliny enumerates only ten), Judaea proper
was arranged, the Rabbis take no notice, although some of their names
have been traced in Talmudical writings. These provinces were no doubt
again subdivided into districts or hyparchies, just as the towns were
into quarters or hegemonies, both terms occurring in the Talmud. The
Rabbis forbade the exportation of provisions from Palestine, even into
Syria.

Travelling southward from Caesarea we are in the plain of Sharon, whose
beauty and richness are so celebrated in Holy Scripture (Cant 2:1; Isa
35:2). This plain extends as far as Lydda, where it merges into that of
Darom, which stretches farther southwards. In accordance with the
statements of Holy Scripture (Isa 65:10) the plain of Sharon was always
celebrated for its pasturage. According to the Talmud most of the calves
for sacrifices were brought from that district. The wine of Sharon was
celebrated, and, for beverage, supposed to be mixed with one-third of
water.

The plain was also well known for the manufacture of pottery; but it
must have been of an inferior kind, since the Mishnah (Baba K. vi. 2) in
enumerating for what proportion of damaged goods a purchaser might not
claim compensation, allows not less than ten per cent for breakage in
the pottery of Sharon. In Jer. Sotah viii. 3, we read that the
permission to return from war did not apply to those who had built brick
houses in Sharon, it being explained that the clay was so bad, that the
houses had to be rebuilt within seven years.

Hence also the annual prayer of the high-priest on the Day of Atonement,
that the houses of the men of Sharon should not become their graves (see
The Temple). Antipatris, the place where the foot soldiers had left St.
Paul in charge of the horsemen (Acts 23:31), had once been the scene of
a very different array. For it was here that, according to tradition
(Yoma, 69 a), the priesthood, under Simon the Just, had met Alexander
the Great in that solemn procession, which secured the safety of the
Temple. In Talmudical writings it bears the same name, which was given
it by Herod, in memory of his father Antipater (Ant. vi, 5.2).

The name of Chephar Zaba, however, also occurs, possibly that of an
adjoining locality. In Sanh. 94 b, we read that Hezekiah had suspended a
board at the entrance of the Beth Midrash (or college), with the
notification that whoever studied not the Law was to be destroyed.
Accordingly they searched from Dan to Beersheba, and found not a single
unlettered person, nor yet from Gebath to Antipatris, boy or girl, man
or woman, who was not fully versed in all the legal ordinances
concerning clean and unclean.

Another remarkable illustration of the New Testament is afforded by
Lydda, the Talmudical Lod or Lud. We read that, in consequence of the
labours of St. Peter and the miracle wrought on Aeneas, “all that dwelt
at Lydda and Saron…turned to the Lord” (Acts 9:35). The brief notice of
Lydda given in this narrative of the apostle’s labours, is abundantly
confirmed by Talmudical notices, although, of course, we must not expect
them to describe the progress of Christianity. We can readily believe
that Lydda had its congregation of “saints,” almost from the first,
since it was (Maas. Sh. v. 2) within an easy day’s journey west of
Jerusalem. Indeed, as the Talmud explains, the second tithes (Deu 14:22,
26:12) from Lydda could not be converted into money, but had to be
brought to the city itself, so “that the streets of Jerusalem might be
garlanded with fruits.”

The same passage illustrates the proximity of Lydda to the city, and the
frequent intercourse between the two, by saying that the women of Lydda
mixed their dough, went up to Jerusalem, prayed in the Temple, and
returned before it had fermented. Similarly, we infer from Talmudical
documents that Lydda had been the residence of many Rabbis before the
destruction of Jerusalem. After that event, it became the seat of a very
celebrated school, presided over by some of the leaders of Jewish
thought.

It was this school which boldly laid it down, that, to avoid death,
every ordinance of the Law might be broken, except those in regard to
idolatry, incest, and murder. It was in Lydda, also, that two brothers
voluntarily offered themselves victims to save their co-religionists
from slaughter, threatened because a body had been found, whose death
was imputed to the Jews. It sounds like a sad echo of the taunts
addressed by “chief priests,” “scribes and elders,” to Jesus on the
cross (Matt 27:41-43) when, on the occasion just mentioned, the Roman
thus addressed the martyrs: “If you are of the people of Ananias,
Mishael, and Azarias, let your God come, and save you from my hand!”
(Taan. 18, 6).

But a much more interesting chain of evidence connects Lydda with the
history of the founding of the Church. It is in connection with Lydda
and its tribunal, which is declared to have been capable of pronouncing
sentence of death, that our blessed Lord and the Virgin Mother are
introduced in certain Talmudical passages, though with studiously and
blasphemously altered names. The statements are, in their present form,
whether from ignorance, design, or in consequence of successive
alterations, confused, and they mix up different events and persons in
Gospel history; among other things representing our Lord as condemned at
Lydda. <sup>**[<sup>21</sup>](#sdfootnote21sym)**</sup>

But there can be no reasonable question that they refer to our blessed
Lord and His condemnation for supposed blasphemy and seduction of the
people, and that they at least indicate a close connection between Lydda
and the founding of Christianity. It is a curious confirmation of the
gospel history, that the death of Christ is there described as having
taken place “on the eve of the Passover,” remarkably bearing out not
only the date of that event as gathered from the synoptical gospels, but
showing that the Rabbis at least knew nothing of those Jewish scruples
and difficulties, by which modern Gentile writers have tried to prove
the impossibility of Christ’s condemnation on the Paschal night. It has
already been stated that, after the destruction of Jerusalem, many and
most celebrated Rabbis chose Lydda for their residence.

But the second century witnessed a great change. The inhabitants of
Lydda are now charged with pride, ignorance, and neglect of their
religion. The Midrash (Esther 1:3) has it, that there were “ten measures
of wretchedness in the world. Nine of those belong to Lod, the tenth to
all the rest of the world.” Lydda was the last place in Judaea to which,
after their migration into Galilee, the Rabbis resorted to fix the
commencement of the month. Jewish legend has it, that they were met by
the “evil eye,” which caused their death. There may, perhaps, be an
allegorical allusion in this. Certain it is, that, at the time, Lydda
was the seat of a most flourishing Christian Church, and had its bishop.
Indeed, a learned Jewish writer has connected the changed Jewish feeling
towards Lod with the spread of Christianity. Lydda must have been a very
beautiful and a very busy place. The Talmud speaks in exaggerated terms
of the honey of its dates (Cheth. iii. a), and the Mishnah (Baba M. iv.
3) refers to its merchants as a numerous class, although their honesty
is not extolled. <sup>**[<sup>22</sup>](#sdfootnote22sym)**</sup>

Near Lydda, eastwards, was the village of Chephar Tabi. We might be
tempted to derive from it the name of Tabitha (Acts 9:36), if it were
not that the names Tabi and Tabitha had been so common at the time in
Palestine. There can be no question of the situation of Joppa, the
modern Jaffa, where Peter saw the vision which opened the door of the
Church to the Gentiles. Many Rabbis are mentioned in connection with
Joppa. The town was destroyed by Vespasian. There is a curious legend in
the Midrash to the effect that Joppa was not overwhelmed by the deluge.
Could this have been an attempt to insinuate the preservation and
migration of men to distant parts of the earth? The exact location of
Emmaus, for ever sacred to us by the manifestation of the Saviour to the
two disciples (Luke 24:13), is matter of controversy. On the whole, the
weight of evidence still inclines to the traditional site.
<sup>**[<sup>23</sup>](#sdfootnote23sym)**</sup>

If so, it had a considerable Jewish population, although it was also
occupied by a Roman garrison. Its climate and waters were celebrated, as
also its market-place. It is specially interesting to find that among
the patrician Jewish families belonging to the laity, who took part in
the instrumental music of the Temple, two–those of Pegarim and
Zippariah–were from Emmaus, and also that the priesthood were wont to
intermarry with the wealthy Hebrews of that place (Er. ii. 4). Gaza, on
whose “desert” road Philip preached to and baptized the Ethiopian
eunuch, counted not fewer than eight heathen temples, besides an
idol-shrine just outside the city. Still Jews were allowed to reside
there, probably on account of its important market.

Only two names yet remain to be mentioned, but those of the deepest and
most solemn interest. Bethlehem, the birthplace of our Lord, and
Jerusalem, where He was crucified. It deserves notice, that the answer
which the Sanhedrists of old gave to the inquiries of Herod (Matt 2:5)
is equally returned in many Talmudical passages, and with the same
reference to Micah 5:2. It may therefore be regarded as a settled point
that, according to the Jewish fathers, Messiah, the Son of David, was to
be born in Bethlehem of Judah. But there is one passage in the Mishnah
which throws such peculiar light on the Gospel narrative, that it will
be best to give it in its entirety.

We know that, on the night in which our Saviour was born, the angels’
message came to those who probably alone of all in or near Bethlehem
were “keeping watch.” For, close by Bethlehem, on the road to Jerusalem,
was a tower, known as Migdal Eder, the “watch-tower of the flock.” For
here was the station where shepherd watched their flocks destined for
sacrifices in the Temple. So well known was this, that if animals were
found as far from Jerusalem as Migdal Eder, and within that circuit on
every side, the males were offered as burnt-offerings, the females as
peace-offerings. <sup>**[<sup>24</sup>](#sdfootnote24sym)**</sup>

R. Jehudah adds: “If suited for Paschal sacrifices, then they are
Paschal sacrifices, provided it be not more than thirty days before the
feast” (Shekal. vii 4; compare also Jer. Kid. ii. 9). It seems of
deepest significance, almost like the fulfilment of type, that those
shepherds who first heard tidings of the Saviour’s birth, who first
listened to angels’ praises, were watching flocks destined to be offered
as sacrifices in the Temple. There was the type, and here the reality.
At all times Bethlehem was among “the least” in Judah–so small that the
Rabbis do not even refer to it in detail. The small village-inn was
over-crowded, and the guests from Nazareth found shelter only in the
stable, \*<sup>**[<sup>25</sup>](#sdfootnote25sym)**</sup> whose manger
became the cradle of the King of Israel.

It was here that those who tended the sacrificial flocks,
heaven-directed, found the Divine Babe–significantly the first to see
Him, to believe, and to adore. But this is not all. It is when we
remember, that presently these shepherds would be in the Temple, and
meet those who came thither to worship and to sacrifice, that we
perceive the full significance of what otherwise would have seemed
scarcely worth while noticing in connection with humble shepherds: “And
when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told
them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those
things which were told them by the shepherds” (Luke 2:17,18).

Moreover, we can understand the wonderful impression made on those in
the courts of the Temple, as, while they selected their sacrifices, the
shepherds told the devout of the speedy fulfilment of all these types in
what they had themselves seen and heard in that night of wonders; how
eager, curious crowds might gather around to discuss, to wonder, perhaps
to mock; how the heart of “just and devout” old Simeon would be
gladdened within him, in expectation of the near realisation of a life’s
hopes and prayers; and how aged Anna, and they who like her “looked for
redemption in Israel,” would lift up their heads, since their salvation
was drawing nigh.

Thus the shepherds would be the most effectual heralds of the Messiah in
the Temple, and both Simeon and Anna be prepared for the time when the
infant Saviour would be presented in the sanctuary. But there is yet
another verse which, as we may suggest, would find a fuller explanation
in the fact that these shepherds tended the Temple flocks. When in Luke
2:20 we read that “the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God,”
the meaning in that connection
<sup>**[<sup>26</sup>](#sdfootnote26sym)**</sup> seems somewhat
difficult till we realise that, after bringing their flocks to the
Temple, they would return to their own homes, and carry with them,
joyfully and gratefully, tidings of the great salvation.

Lastly, without entering into controversy, the passage from the Mishnah
above quoted in great measure disposes of the objection against the
traditional date of our Lord’s birth, derived from the supposed fact,
that the rains of December would prevent the flocks being kept all night
“in the field.” For, in the first place, these were flocks on their way
to Jerusalem, and not regularly pasturing in the open at that season.
And, secondly, the Mishnah evidently contemplates their being thus in
the open thirty days before the Passover, or in the month of February,
during which the average rainfall is quite the largest in the year.
<sup>**[<sup>27</sup>](#sdfootnote27sym)**</sup>

“Ten measures of beauty,” say the Rabbis, “hath God bestowed upon the
world, and nine of these fall to the lot of Jerusalem”–and again, “A
city, the fame of which has gone out from one end of the world to the
other” (Ber. 38). “Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, the power, the
glory, and eternity.” This–explains the Talmud–“is Jerusalem.” In
opposition to her rival Alexandria, which was designated “the little,”
Jerusalem was called “the great.” It almost reminds one of the title
“eternal city,” given to Rome, when we find the Rabbis speaking of
Jerusalem as the “eternal house.”

Similarly, if a common proverb has it, that “all roads lead to Rome,” it
was a Jewish saying, “All coins come from Jerusalem.” This is not the
place to describe the city in its appearance and glory (for this compare
the two first chapters of my volume on The Temple: Its Ministry and
Services). But one almost feels as if, on such a subject, one could
understand, if not condone, the manifest exaggerations of the Rabbis.
Indeed, there are indications that they scarcely expected their
statements to be taken literally. Thus, when the number of its
synagogues is mentioned as 460 or 480, it is explained that the latter
number is the numerical equivalent of the word “full” in Isaiah 1:21
(“it was full of judgment”).

It is more interesting to know, that we find in the Talmud express
mention of “the Synagogue of the Alexandrians,” referred to in Acts
6:9–another important confirmation, if such were needed, of the accuracy
of St. Luke’s narratives. Of the hospitality of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem accounts are given, which we can scarcely regard as much
exaggerated; for the city was not reckoned to belong to any tribe in
particular; it was to be considered as equally the home of all. Its
houses were to be neither hired nor let, but freely thrown open to every
brother.

Nor did any one among the countless thousands who thronged it at
feast-times ever lack room. A curtain hung before the entrance of a
house intimated, that there was still room for guests; a table spread in
front of it, that its board was still at their disposal. And, if it was
impossible to accommodate within the walls of Jerusalem proper the vast
crowds which resorted to the city, there can be no doubt that for sacred
purpose Bethany and Bethphage were reckoned as within the circle of
Jerusalem. It calls forth peculiar sensations, when we read in these
Jewish records of Bethany and Bethphage as specially celebrated for
their hospitality to pilgrim-guests, for it wakes the sacred memories of
our Lord’s sojourn with the holy family of Bethany, and especially of
His last stay there and of His royal entrance into Jerusalem.

In truth, every effort was used to make Jerusalem truly a city of
delight. Its police and sanitary regulations were more perfect than in
any modern city; the arrangements such as to keep the pilgrim free to
give his heart and mind to sacred subjects. If, after all, “the
townspeople,” as they were called, were regarded as somewhat proud and
supercilious, it was something to be a citizen of Jerushalaimah, as the
Jerusalemites preferred to write its name. Their constant intercourse
with strangers gave them a knowledge of men and of the world. The
smartness and cleverness of the young people formed a theme of
admiration to their more shy and awkward country relatives.

There was also a grandeur in their bearing–almost luxury; and an amount
of delicacy, tact, and tenderness, which appeared in all their public
dealings. Among a people whose wit and cleverness are proverbial, it was
no mean praise to be renowned for these qualities. In short, Jerusalem
was the ideal of the Jew, in whatever land of exile he might tarry. Her
rich men would lavish fortunes on the support of Jewish learning, the
promotion of piety, or the support of the national cause. Thus one of
them would, when he found the price of sacrifices exceedingly high,
introduce into the Temple-court the requisite animals at his own cost,
to render the service possible for the poor.

Or on another occasion he would offer to furnish the city for twenty-one
months with certain provisions in her struggle against Rome. In the
streets of Jerusalem men from the most distant countries met, speaking
every variety of language and dialect. Jews and Greeks, Roman soldiers
and Galilean peasants, Pharisees, Sadducees, and white-robed Essenes,
busy merchants and students of abstruse theology, mingled, a motley
crowd, in the narrow streets of the city of palaces. But over all the
Temple, rising above the city, seemed to fling its shadow and its glory.

Each morning the threefold blast of the priests’ trumpets wakened the
city with a call to prayer; each evening the same blasts closed the
working day, as with sounds from heaven. Turn where you might,
everywhere the holy buildings were in view, now with the smoke of
sacrifices curling over the courts, or again with solemn stillness
resting upon the sacred hills.

It was the Temple which gave its character to Jerusalem, and which
decided its fate. There is a remarkable passage in the Talmud, which,
remembering that the time to which it refers was in all probability the
very year in which our Lord died on the cross, reads like an unwilling
confirmation of the Gospel narrative: "Forty years before the
destruction of the Temple, its doors opened of their own accord.
Jochanan, <sup>**[<sup>28</sup>](#sdfootnote28sym)**</sup> the son of
Saccai, rebuked them, saying: O Temple, why openest thou of thine own
accord? Ah! I perceive that thine end is at hand; for it is written
(Zech 11:1): ‘Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy
cedars’" (Yoma 39 b). “And, behold, the veil of the Temple was rent in
twain from the top to the bottom” (Matt 27:51)–blessed be God, not
merely in announcement of coming judgment, but henceforth to lay open
unto all the way into the Holiest of All.

Chapter 6. Jewish Homes
=======================

It may be safely asserted, that the grand distinction, which divided all
mankind into Jews and Gentiles, was not only religious, but also social.
However near the cities of the heathen to those of Israel, however
frequent and close the intercourse between the two parties, no one could
have entered a Jewish town or village without feeling, so to speak, in
quite another world. The aspect of the streets, the building and
arrangement of the houses, the municipal and religious rule, the manners
and customs of the people, their habits and ways–above all, the family
life, stood in marked contrast to what would be seen elsewhere. On every
side there was evidence that religion here was not merely a creed, nor a
set of observances, but that it pervaded every relationship, and
dominated every phase of life.

Let us imagine a real Jewish town or village. There were many such, for
Palestine had at all times a far larger number of towns and villages
than might have been expected from its size, or from the general
agricultural pursuits of its inhabitants. Even at the time of its first
occupation under Joshua we find somewhere about six hundred towns–if we
may judge by the Levitical cities, of about an average circumference of
two thousand cubits on each side, and with probably an average
population of from two to three thousand. But the number of towns and
villages, as well as their populousness, greatly increased in later
times.

Thus Josephus (Life, 45) speaks of not fewer than two hundred and forty
townships in Galilee alone in his days. This progress was, no doubt, due
not only to the rapid development of society, but also to the love of
building that characterized Herod and his family, and to which so many
fortresses, palaces, temples, and towns owed their origin. Alike the New
Testament, Josephus, and the Rabbis give us three names, which may be
rendered by villages, townships, and towns–the latter being surrounded
by walls, and again distinguished into those fortified already at the
time of Joshua, and those of later date. A township might be either
“great,” if it had its synagogue, or small, if it wanted such; this
being dependent on the residence of at least ten men, who could always
be reckoned upon to form a quorum for the worship of the synagogue (the
so-called Batlanin <sup>**[<sup>29</sup>](#sdfootnote29sym)**</sup> );
for service could not be celebrated with any less number of males.

The villages had no synagogue; but their inhabitants were supposed to go
to the nearest township for market on the Monday and Thursday of every
week, when service was held for them, and the local Sanhedrin also sat
(Megill. i. 1-3). A very curious law provided (Cheth. 110), that a man
could not oblige his wife to follow him if he moved either from a
township to a town, or the reverse. The reason of the former provision
was, that in a town people lived together, and the houses were close to
each other; hence there was a want of fresh, free air, and of gardens,
which were enjoyed in townships. On the other hand, a woman might object
to exchange residence in a town for one in a township, because in a town
everything was to be got, and people met in the streets and market-place
from all the neighborhood.

Statements like these will give some idea of the difference between town
and country life. Let us first think of the former. Approaching one of
the ancient fortified towns, one would come to a low wall that protected
a ditch. Crossing this moat, one would be at the city wall proper, and
enter through a massive gate, often covered with iron, and secured by
strong bars and bolts. Above the gate rose the watch-tower. “Within the
gate” was the shady or sheltered retreat where “the elders” sat. Here
grave citizens discussed public affairs or the news of the day, or
transacted important business. The gates opened upon large squares, on
which the various streets converged. Here was the busy scene of
intercourse and trade.

The country-people stood or moved about, hawking the produce of field,
orchard, and dairy; the foreign merchant or peddler exposed his wares,
recommending the newest fashions from Rome or Alexandria, the latest
luxuries from the far East, or the art produce of the goldsmith and the
modeler at Jerusalem, while among them moved the crowd, idle or busy,
chattering, chaffing, good-humored, and bandying witticisms. Now they
give way respectfully before a Pharisee; or their conversation is hushed
by the weird appearance of an Essene or of some sectary–political or
religious,–while low, muttered curses attend the stealthy steps of the
publican, whose restless eyes wander around to watch that nothing escape
the close meshes of the tax-gatherer’s net.

These streets are all named, mostly after the trades or guilds which
have there their bazaars. For a guild always keeps together, whether in
street or synagogue. In Alexandria the different trades sat in the
synagogue arranged into guilds; and St. Paul could have no difficulty in
meeting in the bazaar of his trade with the like-minded Aquila and
Priscilla (Acts 18:2,3), with whom to find a lodging. In these bazaars
many of the workmen sat outside their shops, and, in the interval of
labor, exchanged greetings or banter with the passers-by. For all Israel
are brethren, and there is a sort of freemasonry even in the Jewish mode
of salutation, which always embodied either an acknowledgment of the God
of Israel, or a brotherly wish of peace.

Excitable, impulsive, quick, sharp-witted, imaginative; fond of parable,
pithy sayings, acute distinctions, or pungent wit; reverent towards God
and man, respectful in the presence of age, enthusiastic of learning and
of superior mental endowments, most delicately sensitive in regard to
the feelings of others; zealous, with intensely warm Eastern natures,
ready to have each prejudice aroused, hasty and violent in passion, but
quickly assuaged–such is the motley throng around.

And now, perhaps, the voice of a Rabbi, teaching in some shady
retreat–although latterly Jewish pride of learning forbade the
profanation of lore by popularizing it for the “unlearned”–or, better
far, at one time the presence of the Master, gathers and keeps them
spell-bound, forgetful alike of the cravings of hunger and of the lapse
of time, till, the short Eastern day ended, the stars shining out on the
deep blue sky must have reminded many among them of the promise to their
father Abraham, now fulfilled in One greater than Abraham.

Back to the town in the cool of even to listen to the delicious murmur
of well or fountain, as those crowd around it who have not cisterns in
their own houses. The watchman is on the top of the tower above the
gateway; presently, night-watchers will patrol the streets. Nor is there
absolute darkness, for it is customary to keep a light burning all night
in the house, and the windows (unlike those of modern Eastern dwellings)
open chiefly on street and road. Those large windows are called Tyrian,
the smaller ones Egyptian. They are not filled in with glass, but
contain gratings or lattices. In the houses of the rich the
window-frames are elaborately carved, and richly inlaid.

Generally the woodwork is of the common sycamore, sometimes of olive or
cedar, and in palaces even of Indian sandal-wood. The entablature is
more or less curiously carved and ornamented. Only there must be no
representation of anything in heaven or on earth. So deep was the
feeling on this point, that even the attempt of Pilate to introduce by
night into Jerusalem the effigies of Caesar on the top of the Roman
standards led to scenes in which the Jews showed themselves willing to
die for their convictions (Josephus, Ant, xviii, 59); while the palace
of Herod Antipas at Tiberias was burned by the mob because it was
decorated with figures of animals (Josephus, Life, 62-67).

These extreme views, however, gave way, first, before the tolerant
example of Gamaliel, the teacher of Paul, who made use of a public bath,
although adorned by a statue of Venus, since, as he put it, the statue
was intended for the embellishment of the bath, and not the bath for the
sake of the statue. If this argument reminds us that Gamaliel was not a
stranger to Christianity, the statement of his grandson, that an idol
was nothing if its worship had been disclaimed by the heathen (Ab. Sar.
52), recalls still more strongly the teaching of St. Paul. And so we
gradually come down to the modern orthodox doctrine, which allows the
representation of plants, animals, etc., but prohibits that of sun,
moon, and stars, except for purposes of study, while, though doubtfully,
it admits those of men and even angels, provided they be in sunken, not
in raised workmanship.

The rule of these towns and villages was exceedingly strict. The
representatives of Rome were chiefly either military men, or else fiscal
or political agents. We have, indeed, a notice that the Roman general
Gabinius, about half a century before Christ, divided Palestine for
juridical purposes into five districts, each presided over by a council
(Josephus, Ant. xiv, 91); but that arrangement was only of very short
duration, and even while it lasted these councils seem to have been
Jewish. Then every town had is Sanhedrin,
<sup>**[<sup>30</sup>](#sdfootnote30sym)**</sup> consisting of
twenty-three members if the place numbered at least one hundred and
twenty men, or of three members if the population were smaller.
<sup>**[<sup>31</sup>](#sdfootnote31sym)**</sup>

These Sanhedrists were appointed directly by the supreme authority, or
Great Sanhedrin, “the council,” at Jerusalem, which consisted of
seventy-one members. It is difficult to fix the limits of the actual
power wielded by these Sanhedrins in criminal cases. But the smaller
Sanhedrins are referred to in such passages as Matthew 5:22, 23, 10:17;
Mark 13:9. Of course all ecclesiastical and, so to speak, strictly
Jewish causes, and all religious questions were within their special
cognizance. Lastly, there were also in every place what we may call
municipal authorities, under the presidency of a mayor–the
representatives of the “elders”–an institution so frequently mentioned
in Scripture, and deeply rooted in Jewish society. Perhaps these may be
referred to in Luke 7:3, as sent by the centurion of Capernaum to
intercede for him with the Lord.

What may be called the police and sanitary regulations were of the
strictest character. Of Caesarea, for example, we know that there was a
regular system of drainage into the sea, apparently similar to, but more
perfect than that of any modern town (Josephus, Ant. xv, 340). The same
holds true in regard to the Temple-buildings at Jerusalem. But in every
town and village sanitary rules were strictly attended to. Cemeteries,
tanneries, and whatever also might be prejudicial to health, had to be
removed at least fifty cubits outside a town.

Bakers’ and dyers’ shops, or stables, were not allowed under the
dwelling of another person. Again, the line of each street had to be
strictly kept in building, nor was even a projection beyond it allowed.
In general the streets were wider than those of modern Eastern cities.
The nature of the soil, and the circumstance that so many towns were
built on hills (at least in Judea), would, of course, be advantageous in
a sanitary point of view. It would also render the paving of the streets
less requisite. But we know that certain towns were paved–Jerusalem with
white stones (Josephus, Ant. xx, 219-223).

To obviate occasions of dispute, neighbors were not allowed to have
windows looking into the courts or rooms of others nor might the
principal entrance to a shop be through a court common to two or three
dwellings.

These brief notices may help us better to realize the surroundings of
Jewish town life. Looking up and down one of the streets of a town in
Galilee or Judea, the houses would be seen to differ in size and in
elegance, from the small cottage, only eight or ten yards square, to the
mansions of the rich, sometimes two or more stories high, and
embellished by rows of pillars and architectural adornments.

Suppose ourselves in front of a better-class dwelling, though not
exactly that of a patrician, for it is built of brick, or perhaps of
undressed, or even of dressed stone, but not of marble, nor yet of hewn
stone; nor are its walls painted with such delicate colors as vermilion,
but simply whitewashed, or, may be, covered with some neutral tint. A
wide, sometimes costly, stair leads from the outside straight up to the
flat roof, which is made to slope a little downwards, so as to allow the
rainwater easily to flow through pipes into the cistern below. The roof
is paved with brick, stone, or other hard substance, and surrounded by a
balustrade, which, according to Jewish law, must be at least two cubits
(three feet) high, and strong enough to bear the weight of a person.

Police-regulations, conceived in the same spirit of carefulness,
prohibited open wells and pits, insufficient ladders, rickety stairs,
even dangerous dogs about a house. From roof to roof there might be a
regular communication, called by the Rabbis “the road of the roofs”
(Babba Mez. 88 b). Thus a person could make his escape, passing from
roof to roof, till at the last house he would descend the stairs that
led down its outside, without having entered any dwelling. To this “road
of the roofs” our Lord no doubt referred in His warning to His followers
(Matt 24:17; Mark 13:15; Luke 17:31), intended to apply to the last
siege of Jerusalem: “And let him that is on the housetop not go down
into the house, neither enter therein.”

For ordinary intercourse the roof was the coolest, the airiest, the
stillest place. Of course, at times it would be used for purposes of
domestic economy. But thither a man would retire in preference for
prayer or quiet thinking; here he would watch, and wait, and observe
whether friend or foe, the gathering of the storm, or–as the priest
stationed on the pinnacle of the Temple before the morning sacrifice–how
the red and golden light of dawn spread along the edge of the horizon.
From the roof, also, it was easy to protect oneself against enemies, or
to carry on dangerous fight with those beneath; and assuredly, if
anywhere, it was “on the housetops” where secrets might be whispered,
or, on the other hand, the most public “proclamation” of them be made
(Matt 10:27; Luke 12:3).

The stranger’s room was generally built on the roof, in order that,
undisturbed by the household, the guest might go out and come in; and
here, at the feast of Tabernacles, for coolness and convenience, the
leafy “booths” were often reared, in which Israel dwelt in memory of
their pilgrimage. Close by was “the upper chamber.” On the roof the
family would gather for converse, or else in the court beneath–with its
trees spreading grateful shade, and the music of its plashing fountain
falling soothingly on the ear, as you stood in the covered gallery that
ran all around, and opened on the apartments of the household.

If the guest-chamber on the roof, which could be reached from the
outside, without passing through the house, reminds us of Elisha and the
Shunammite, and of the last Passover-supper, to which the Lord and His
disciples could go, and which they could leave, without coming in
contact with any in the house, the gallery that ran round the court
under the roof recalls yet another most solemn scene. We remember how
they who bore the man “sick of the palsy,” when unable to “come nigh
unto Jesus for the press,” “uncovered the roof where He was,” “and let
him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus”
(Mark 2:4; Luke 5:19).

We know, from many Talmudical passages, that the Rabbis resorted in
preference to “the upper room” when discussing religious questions. It
may have been so in this instance; and, unable to gain access through
the door which led into the upper room, the bearers of the sick may have
broken down the ceiling from the roof. Or, judging it more likely that
the attendant multitude thronged the court beneath, while Jesus stood in
the gallery that ran round the court and opened into the various
apartments, they might have broken down the roof above Him, and so
slowly let down their burden at His feet, and in sight of them all.

There is a significant parallelism, or rather contrast, to this in a
Rabbinical story (Moed K. 25 a), which relates how, when the bier on
which a celebrated teacher was laid could not be passed out at the door,
they carried up their burden and let it down from the roof–on its way,
not to a new life, but to burial. Otherwise, there was also a stair
which led from the roof into the court and house. Approaching a house,
as visitors ordinarily would do, from the street, you would either pass
through a large outer court, or else come straight to the vestibule or
porch. Here the door opened into the inner court, which sometimes was
shared by several families. A porter opened to callers on mentioning
their names, as did Rhoda to Peter on the eventful night of his
miraculous deliverance from prison (Acts 12:13,14).

Our Lord also applies this well-known fact of domestic life, when He
says (Rev 3:20), “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man
hear My voice, and open the door, I will come into him, and will sup
with him, and he with Me.” Passing through this inner court, and through
the gallery, you would reach the various rooms–the family room, the
reception room, and the sleeping apartments–the most retired being
occupied by the ladies, and the inner rooms used chiefly in winter. The
furniture was much the same as that now in use, consisting of tables,
couches, chairs, candlesticks, and lamps, varying in costliness
according to the rank and wealth of the family. Among articles of luxury
we mention rich cushions for the head and arms, ornaments, and sometimes
even pictures. The doors, which moved on hinges fastened with wooden
pins, were barred by wooden bolts, which could be withdrawn by check
keys from the outside. The dining apartment was generally spacious, and
sometimes employed for meetings.

We have been describing the arrangements and the appearance of towns and
dwellings in Palestine. But it is not any of these outward things which
gives a real picture of a Jewish home. Within, everything was quite
peculiar. At the outset, the rite of circumcision separated the Jew from
the nations around, and dedicated him to God. Private prayer, morning
and evening, hallowed daily life, and family religions pervaded the
home. Before every meal they washed and prayed: after it they “gave
thanks.” Besides, there were what may be designated as special family
feasts.

The return of the Sabbath sanctified the week of labor. It was to be
welcomed as a king, or with songs as a bridegroom; and each household
observed it as a season of sacred rest and of joy. True, Rabbinism made
all this a matter of mere externalism, converting it into an unbearable
burden, by endless injunctions of what constituted work and of that
which was supposed to produce joy, thereby utterly changing its sacred
character. Still, the fundamental idea remained, like a broken pillar
that shows where the palace had stood, and what had been its noble
proportions.

As the head of the house returned on the Sabbath-eve from the synagogue
to his home, he found it festively adorned, the Sabbath lamp brightly
burning, and the table spread with the richest each household could
afford. But first he blessed each child with the blessing of Israel. And
next evening, when the Sabbath light faded out, he made solemn
“separation” between the hallowed day and the working week, and so
commenced his labor once more in the name of the Lord. Nor were the
stranger, the poor, the widow, or the fatherless forgotten. How fully
they were provided for, how each shared in what was to be considered not
a burden but a privilege, and with what delicacy relief was
administered–for all Israel were brethren, and fellow-citizens of their
Jerusalem–those know best who have closely studied Jewish life, its
ordinances and practices.

But this also is rather a sketch of religious than of family life. At
the outset, we should here say, that even the Hebrew name for “woman,”
given her at her creation (Gen 2:23), marked a wife as the companion of
her husband, and his equal (“Ishah,” a woman, from “Ish,” a man). But it
is when we consider the relations between man and wife, children and
parents, the young and the aged, that the vast difference between
Judaism and heathenism so strikingly appears. Even the relationship in
which God presented Himself to His people, as their Father, would give
peculiar strength and sacredness to the bond which connected earthly
parents with their offspring.

Here it should be borne in mind that, so to speak, the whole purpose of
Israel as a nation, with a view to the appearance of the Messiah from
among them, made it to each household a matter of deepest interest that
no light in Israel should be extinguished through want of succession.
Hence, such an expression as (Jer 22:10), “Weep sore for him that goeth
away: for he shall return no more,” was applied to those who died
childless (Moed K. 27).

Similarly, it was said that he who had no child was like one dead.
Proverbial expressions in regard to the “parental relation” occur in
Rabbinical writings, which in their higher application remind us that
the New Testament writers were Jews. If, in the impassioned strain of
happy assurance concerning our Christian safety, we are told (Rom 8:33),
“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that
justifieth,” we may believe that St. Paul was familiar with a saying
like this: “Shall a father bear witness against his son?” (Abod S. 3).
The somewhat similar question, “Is there a father who hateth his own
son?” may recall to our minds the comfort which the Epistle to the
Hebrews ministers to those who are in suffering (Heb 12:7), “If ye
endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he
whom the father chasteneth not?”

Speaking of the relation between parents and children, it may be safely
asserted, that no crime was more severely reprobated than any breach of
the fifth commandment. The Talmud, with its usual punctiliousness,
enters into details, when it lays down as a rule that “a son is bound to
feed his father, to give him drink, to clothe him, to protect him, to
lead him in, and to conduct him out, and to wash his face, his hands,
and his feet”; to which the Jerusalem Gemara adds, that a son is even
bound to beg for his father–although here also Rabbinism would give
preference to a spiritual before a natural parent, or rather to one who
teaches the law before a father!

The general state of Jewish society shows us parents as fondly watching
over their children, and children as requiting their care by bearing
with the foibles, and even the trials, arising from the caprices of old
age and infirmity. Such things as undutifulness, or want of loving
consideration for parents, would have wakened a thrill of horror in
Jewish society. As for crimes against parents, which the law of God
visited with the utmost penalty, they seem happily to have been almost
unknown. The Rabbinical ordinances, however, also specified the
obligation of parents, and limited their power.

Thus a son was considered independent whenever he could gain his own
living; and, although a daughter remained in the power of her father
till marriage, she could not, after she was of age, be given away
without her own express and free consent. A father might chastise his
child, but only while young, and even then not to such extent as to
destroy self-respect. But to beat a grown-up son was forbidden on pain
of excommunication; and the apostolic injunction (Eph 6:4), “Fathers,
provoke not your children to wrath,” finds almost its literal
counterpart in the Talmud (Moed K. 17 a). Properly speaking, indeed, the
Jewish law limited the absolute obligation of a father (a mother was
free from such legal obligation) to feed, clothe, and house his child to
his sixth year, after which he could only be admonished to it as one of
the duties of love, but not legally constrained (Chethub. 49 b; 65 b).
In case of separation of the parents, the mother had charge of the
daughters, and the father of the sons; but the latter also might be
entrusted to the mother, if the judges considered it for the advantage
of the children.

A few notices as to the reverence due to age will appropriately close
this brief sketch of Jewish home life. It was a beautiful
thought–however some may doubt its exegetical correctness–that just as
the pieces of the broken tables of the law were kept in the ark, so old
age should be venerated and cherished, even though it should be broken
in mind or memory (Ber. 8 b).

Assuredly, Rabbinism went to the utmost verge in this matter when it
recommended reverence for age, even though it were in the case of one
ignorant of the law, or of a Gentile. There were, however, diverging
opinions on this point. The passage, Leviticus 19:32, “Thou shalt rise
up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man,” was
explained to refer only to sages, who alone were to be regarded as old.
If R. Jose compared such as learned of young men to those who ate unripe
grapes and drank of new wine, R. Jehudah taught, “Look not at the
bottles, but at what they contain. There are new bottles full of old
wine, and old bottles which contain not even new wine” (Ab. iv. 20).

Again, if in Deuteronomy 13:1, 2, and also, 18:21, 22 the people were
directed to test a prophet by the signs which he showed–a misapplication
of which was made by the Jews, when they asked Christ what sign He
showed unto them (John 2:18, 6:30)–while in Deuteronomy 17:10 they were
told simply “to do according to all that they of that place inform
thee,” it was asked, What, then, is the difference between an old man
and a prophet? To this the reply was: A prophet is like an ambassador,
whom you believe in consequence of his royal credentials; but an ancient
is one whose word you receive without requiring such evidence. And it
was strictly enjoined that proper outward marks of respect should be
shown to old age, such as to rise in the presence of older men, not to
occupy their seats, to answer them modestly, and to assign to them the
uppermost places at feasts.

After having thus marked how strictly Rabbinism watched over the mutual
duties of parents and children, it will be instructive to note how at
the same time traditionalism, in its worship of the letter, really
destroyed the spirit of the Divine law. An instance will here suffice;
and that which we select has the double advantage of illustrating an
otherwise difficult allusion in the New Testament, and of exhibiting the
real characteristics of traditionalism.

No commandment could be more plainly in accordance, alike with the
spirit and the letter of the law, than this: “He that curseth father or
mother, let him die the death.” Yet our Lord distinctly charges
traditionalism with “transgressing” it (Matt 15:4-6). The following
quotation from the Mishnah (Sanh. vii. 8) curiously illustrates the
justice of His accusation: “He that curseth his father or his mother is
not guilty, unless he curses them with express mention of the name of
Jehovah.” In any other case the sages declare him absolved! And this is
by no means a solitary instance of Rabbinical perversion. Indeed, the
moral systems of the synagogue leave the same sad impression on the mind
as its doctrinal teaching. They are all elaborate chains of casuistry,
of which no truer description could be given than in the words of the
Savior (Matt 15:6): “Ye have made the commandment of God of none effect
by your tradition.”

Chapter 7. The Upbringing of Jewish Children
============================================

The tenderness of the bond which united Jewish parents to their children
appears even in the multiplicity and pictorialness of the expressions by
which the various stages of child-life are designated in the Hebrew.
Besides such general words as “ben” and “bath”-“son” and “daughter”–we
find no fewer than nine different terms, each depicting a fresh stage of
life. The first of these simply designates the babe as the
newly-“born”–the “jeled,” or, in the feminine, “jaldah”–as in Exodus
2:3, 6, 8. But the use of this term throws a fresh light on the meaning
of some passages of Scripture.

Thus we remember that it is applied to our Lord in the prophecy of His
birth (Isa 9:6): “For a babe” (’jeled’) is born unto us, a son (’ben’)
is given to us“; while in Isaiah 2:6 its employment adds a new meaning
to the charge:”They please themselves (or strike hands) with the
‘jalde’–the ‘babes’–of strangers“–marking them, so to speak, as not only
the children of strangers, but as unholy from their very birth. Compare
also the pictorial, or else the poetical, use of the word”jeled" in such
passages as Isaiah 29:23, 57:4; Jeremiah 31:20; Ecclesiastes 4:13; 1
Kings 12:8; 2 Kings 2:24; Genesis 42:22; and others.

The next child-name, in point of time, is “jonek,” which means,
literally, “a suckling,” being also sometimes used figuratively of
plants, like our English “sucker,” as in Isaiah 53:2: “He shall grow up
before Him as a sucker”–“jonek.” The word “jonek” occurs, for example,
in Isaiah 11:8, and in Psalm 8:2.

On the other hand, the expression in the latter passage, rendered
“babes” in our Authorised Version, marks a yet third stage in the
child’s existence, and a farther advancement in the babe-life. This
appears from many passages. As the word implies, the “olel” is still
“sucking”; but it is no longer satisfied with only this nourishment, and
is “asking bread,” as in Lamentations 4:4: “The tongue of the ‘jonek’
cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the ‘olalim’ ask bread.”

A fourth designation represents the child as the “gamul,” or “weaned
one” (Psa 131:2; Isa 11:8, 28:9), from a verb which primarily means to
complete, and secondarily to wean. As we know, the period of weaning
among the Hebrews was generally at the end of two years (Chethub. 60),
and was celebrated by a feast.

After that the fond eye of the Hebrew parent seems to watch the child as
it is clinging to its mother–as it were, ranging itself by her–whence
the fifth designation, “taph” (Esth 3:13, “The ‘taph’ and the women in
one day”; Jer 40:7; Eze 9:6).

The sixth period is marked by the word “elem” (in the feminine, “almah,”
as in Isa 7:14, of the virgin-mother), which denotes becoming firm and
strong. As one might expect, we have next the “naari,” or
youth–literally, he who shakes off, or shakes himself free.

Lastly, we find the child designated as “bachur,” or the “ripened one”;
a young warrior, as in Isaiah 31:8; Jeremiah 18:21, 15:8, etc.
Assuredly, those who so keenly watched child-life as to give a pictorial
designation to each advancing stage of its existence, must have been
fondly attached to their children.

There is a passage in the Mishnah (Aboth. v. 21), which quaintly maps
out and, as it were, labels the different periods of life according to
their characteristics. It is worth reproducing, if only to serve as
introduction to what we shall have to say on the upbringing of children.

Rabbi Jehudah, the son of Tema, says: “At five years of age, reading of
the Bible; at ten years, learning the Mishnah; at thirteen years, bound
to the commandments; at fifteen years, the study of the Talmud; at
eighteen years, marriage; at twenty, the pursuit of trade or business
(active life); at thirty years, full vigour; at forty, maturity of
reason; at fifty, of counsel; at sixty, commencement of agedness; at
seventy, grey age; at eighty, advanced old age; at ninety, bowed down;
at a hundred, as if he were dead and gone, and taken from the world.”

In the passage just quoted the age of five is mentioned as that when a
child is expected to commence reading the Bible–of course, in the
original Hebrew. But different opinions also prevailed. Generally
speaking, such early instruction was regarded as only safe in the case
of very healthy and strong children; while those of average constitution
were not to be set to regular work till six years old.

There is both common sense and sound experience in this Talmudical
saying (Cheth. 50), “If you set your child to regular study before it is
six years old, you shall always have to run after, and yet never get
hold of it.” This chiefly has reference to the irreparable injury to
health caused by such early strain upon the mind. If, on the other hand,
we come upon an admonition to begin teaching a child when it is three
years old, this must refer to such early instructions as the of certain
passages of Scripture, or of small isolated portions and prayers, which
a parent would make his child repeat from tenderest years. As we shall
show in the sequel, six or seven was the age at which a parent in
Palestine was legally bound to attend to the schooling of his son.

But, indeed, it would have been difficult to say when the instruction of
the Hebrew child really commenced. Looking back, a man must have felt
that the teaching which he most–indeed, one might almost say, which he
exclusively–valued had mingled with the first waking thoughts of his
consciousness. Before the child could speak–before it could almost
understand what was taught, in however elementary language–before it
would even take in the domestic rites of the recurring weekly festival,
or those of the annual feasts–it must have been attracted by the
so-called “Mesusah,” which was fastened at the door-post of every
“clean” apartment, <sup>**[<sup>32</sup>](#sdfootnote32sym)**</sup> and
at the entrance of such houses as were inhabited by Jews exclusively.

The “Mesusah” was a kind of phylactery for the house, serving a purpose
kindred to that of the phylactery for the person, both being derived
from a misunderstanding and misapplication of the Divine direction (Deu
6:9, 11:20), taking in the letter what was meant for the spirit. But
while we gladly concede that the earlier Jewish practice was free from
some of the present almost semi-heathenish customs,
<sup>**[<sup>33</sup>](#sdfootnote33sym)**</sup> and further, that many
houses in Palestine were without it, there can be little doubt that,
even at the time of Christ, this “Mesusah” would be found wherever a
family was at all Pharisaically inclined.

For, not to speak of what seems an allusion to it, so early as in Isaiah
57:8, we have the distinct testimony of Josephus (Ant. iv, 213) and of
the Mishnah to their use (Ber. iii. 3; Megill. i. 8; Moed K. iii. 4;
Men. iii.7–in the last-mentioned place, even with superstitious
additions). Supposing the “Mesusah” to have been somewhat as at present,
it would have consisted of a small, longitudinally-folded parchment
square, on which, on twenty-two lines, these two passages were written:
Deuteronomy 6:4-9, and 11:13-21. Inclosed in a shining metal case, and
affixed to the door-post, the child, when carried in arms, would
naturally put out its hand to it; the more so, that it would see the
father and all others, on going out or in, reverently touch the case,
and afterwards kiss the finger, speaking at the same time a benediction.

From early times, the presence of the “Mesusah” was connected with the
Divine protection, this verse being specially applied to it: “The Lord
shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and
even for evermore” (Psa 121:8). Indeed, one of the most interesting
ancient literary monuments in existence–“Mechilta,” a Jewish commentary
on the book of Exodus, the substance of which is older than the Mishnah
itself, dating from the beginning of the second century of our era, if
not earlier–argues the efficacy of the “Mesusah” from the fact that,
since the destroying angel passed over the doors of Israel which bore
the covenant-mark, a much higher value must attach to the “Mesusah,”
which embodied the name of the Lord no less than ten times, and was to
be found in the dwellings of Israel day and night through all their
generations. From this to the magical mysticism of the “Kabbalah,” and
even to such modern superstitions as that, if dust or dirt were kept
within a cubit of the “Mesusah,” no less a host than three hundred and
sixty-five demons would come, there is a difference of degree rather
than of kind.

But to return. As soon as the child had any knowledge, the private and
the united prayers of the family, and the domestic rites, whether of the
weekly Sabbath or of festive seasons, would indelibly impress themselves
upon his mind. It would be difficult to say which of those feasts would
have the most vivid effect upon a child’s imagination. There was
“Chanukah,” the feast of the Dedication, with its illumination of each
house, when (in most cases) the first evening one candle would be lit
for each member of the household, the number increasing each night,
till, on the eighth, it was eight times that of the first.

Then there was “Purim,” the feast of Esther, with the good cheer and
boisterous merriment which it brought; the feast of Tabernacles, when
the very youngest of the house had to live out in the booth; and,
chiefest of feasts, the week of the Passover, when, all leaven being
carefully purged out, every morsel of food, by its difference from that
ordinarily used, would show the child that the season was a special one.
From the moment a child was at all capable of being instructed–still
more, of his taking any part in the services–the impression would deepen
day by day. Surely no one who had ever worshipped within the courts of
Jehovah’s house at Jerusalem could ever have forgotten the scenes he had
witnessed, or the words he had heard.

Standing in that gorgeous, glorious building, and looking up its
terraced vista, the child would watch with solemn awe, not unmingled
with wonderment, as the great throng of white-robed priests busily moved
about, while the smoke of the sacrifice rose from the altar of
burnt-offering. Then, amid the hushed silence of that vast multitude,
they had all fallen down to worship at the time of incense. Again, on
those steps that led up to the innermost sanctuary the priests had
lifted their hands and spoken over the people the words of blessing; and
then, while the drink-offering was poured out, the Levites’ chant of
Psalms had risen and swelled into a mighty volume; the exquisite treble
of the Levite children’s voices being sustained by the rich round notes
of the men, and accompanied by instrumental music.

The Jewish child knew many of these words. They had been the earliest
songs he had heard–almost his first lesson when clinging as a “taph” to
his mother. But now, in those white-marbled, gold-adorned halls, under
heaven’s blue canopy, and with such surroundings, they would fall upon
his ear like sounds from another world, to which the prolonged threefold
blasts from the silver trumpets of the priests would seem to waken him.
And they were sounds from another world; for, as his father would tell
him, all that he saw was after the exact pattern of heavenly things
which God had shown to Moses on Mount Sinai; all that he heard was
God-uttered, spoken by Jehovah Himself through the mouth of His servant
David, and of the other sweet singers of Israel. Nay, that place and
that house were God-chosen; and in the thick darkness of the Most Holy
Place–there afar off, where the high-priest himself entered on one day
of the year only, and in simple pure white vesture, not in those
splendid golden garments in which he was ordinarily arrayed–had once
stood the ark, with the veritable tables of the law, hewn and graven by
the very hand of God; and between the cherubim had then throned in the
cloud the visible presence of Jehovah. Verily this Temple with its
services was heaven upon earth!

Nor would it have been easy to lose the impression of the first Paschal
Supper which a child had attended. There was that about its symbols and
services which appealed to every feeling, even had it not been that the
law expressly enjoined full instruction to be given as to every part and
rite of the service, as well as to the great event recorded in that
supper. For in that night had Israel been born as a nation, and redeemed
as the “congregation” of the Lord.

Then also, as in a mould, had their future history been cast to all
time; and there, as in type, had its eternal meaning and import for all
men been outlined, and with it God’s purpose of love and work of grace
foreshadowed. Indeed, at a certain part of the service it was expressly
ordained, that the youngest at the Paschal table should rise and
formally ask what was the meaning of all this service, and how that
night was distinguished from others; to which the father was to reply,
by relating, in language suited to the child’s capacity, the whole
national history of Israel, from the calling of Abraham down to the
deliverance from Egypt and the giving of the law; “and the more fully,”
it is added, “he explains it all, the better.” In view of all this,
Philo might indeed, without exaggeration, say that the Jews “were from
their swaddling clothes, even before being taught either the sacred laws
or the unwritten customs, trained by their parents, teachers, and
instructors to recognise God as Father and as the Maker of the world”
(Legat. ad. Cajum, sec. 16); and that, “having been taught the knowledge
(of the laws) from earliest youth, they bore in their souls the image of
the commandments” (Ibid. sec. 31).

To the same effect is the testimony of Josephus, that “from their
earliest consciousness” they had “learned the laws, so as to have
them,as it were, engraven upon the soul” (Ag. Apion, ii, 18); although,
of course, we do not believe it, when, with his usual boastful
magniloquence, he declares that at the age of fourteen he had been
“frequently” consulted by “the high priests and principal men of the
city…about the accurate understanding of points of the law” (Life, 7-12;
compare also Ant. iv, 31; Ag. Apion, i, 60-68, ii, 199-203).

But there is no need of such testimony. The Old Testament, the
Apocrypha, and the New Testament, leading us progressively from century
to century, indicate the same carefulness in the upbringing of children.
One of the earliest narratives of Scripture records how God said to
Abraham, “I know him, that he will command his children, and his
household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah to do
justice and judgment” (Gen 18:19)–a statement which, we may note by the
way, implies the distinction between the seed of Abraham after the flesh
and after the spirit. How thoroughly the spirit of this Divine utterance
was carried out under the law, appears from a comparison of such
passages as Exodus 12:26, 13:8, 14; Deuteronomy 4:9, 10, 6:7, 20, 11:19,
31:13; Psalm 78:5, 6. It is needless to pursue the subject farther, or
to show how even God’s dealings with His people were regarded as the
basis and model of the parental relationship.

But the book in the Old Testament which, if properly studied, would give
us the deepest insight into social and family life under the old
dispensation–we mean the book of Proverbs–is so full of admonitions
about the upbringing of children, that it is sufficient to refer the
reader generally to it. He will find there the value of such training,
its object, in the acquisition of true wisdom in the fear and service of
Jehovah, and the opposite dangers most vividly portrayed–the practical
bearing of all being summed up in this aphorism, true to all times:
“Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will
not depart from it” (Prov 22:6); of which we have this New Testament
application: “Bring up (your children) in the nurture and admonition of
the Lord” (Eph 6:4).

The book of Proverbs brings before us yet another phase of deepest
interest. It contains the fullest appreciation of woman in her true
dignity, and of her position and influence in the family-life. It is
quite true, as we shall presently show, that the obligation to train the
child rested primarily upon the father, and that both by the law of God
and by the ordinances of the Rabbis. But even the patriarchal story will
prepare an attentive reader to find, especially in the early upbringing
of children, that constant influence of woman, which, indeed, the nature
of the maternal relationship implies, provided the family-life be framed
on the model of the Word of God. Lovelier pictures of this than the
mother of Samuel and the pious Shunammite hostess of Elisha can scarcely
be conceived. But the book of Proverbs shows us, that even in the early
times of the Jewish monarchy this characteristic of Old Testament life
also appeared outside the bounds of the Holy Land, wherever pious
Israelites had their settlements. The subject is so deeply interesting,
historically and religiously, and perhaps so new to some readers, that a
slight digression may be allowed us.

Beyond the limits of the Holy Land, close by Dumah, lay the land or
district of Massa (Gen 25:14), one of the original seats of the
Ishmaelites (1 Chron 1:30). From Isaiah 21:11 we gather that it must
have been situate beyond Seir–that is, to the south-east of Palestine,
in Northern Arabia. Whether the Ishmaelites of Massa had come to the
knowledge of Jehovah, the true God; whether Massa was occupied by a
Jewish colony, which there established the service of the Lord;
<sup>**[<sup>34</sup>](#sdfootnote34sym)**</sup> or whether, through the
influence of Hebrew immigrants, such a religious change had been brought
about, certain it is, that the two last chapters of the book of Proverbs
introduce the royal family of Massa as deeply imbued with the spiritual
religion of the Old Testament, and the queen- mother as training the
heir to the throne in the knowledge and fear of the Lord.
<sup>**[<sup>35</sup>](#sdfootnote35sym)**</sup>

Indeed, so much is this the case, that the instruction of the queen of
Massa, and the words of her two royal sons, are inserted in the book of
Proverbs as part of the inspired records of the Old Testament. According
to the best criticism, Proverbs 30:1 should be thus rendered: “The words
of Agur, the son of her whom Massa obeys. Spake the man to
God-with-me–God with me, and I was strong.”
<sup>**[<sup>36</sup>](#sdfootnote36sym)**</sup>

Then Proverbs 31 embodies the words of Augur’s royal brother, even “the
words of Lemuel, king of Massa, with which his mother taught him.” If
the very names of these two princes–Agur, “exile,” and Lemuel, “for
God,” or “dedicated to God”–are significant of her convictions, the
teaching of that royal mother, as recorded in Proverbs 31:2-9, is worthy
of a “mother in Israel.” No wonder that the record of her teaching is
followed by an enthusiastic description of a godly woman’s worth and
work (Prov 31:10-31), each verse beginning with a successive letter of
the Hebrew alphabet (the Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters), like the
various sections of Psalm 119–as it were, to let her praises ring
through every letter of speech.

As might have been expected, the spirit of the Apocryphal books is far
different from that which breathes in the Old Testament. Still, such a
composition as Ecclesiasticus shows that even in comparatively late and
degenerate times the godly upbringing of children occupied a most
prominent place in religious thinking. But it is when we approach the
New Testament, that a fresh halo of glory seems to surround woman. And
here our attention is directed to the spiritual influence of mothers
rather than of fathers. Not to mention “the mother of Zebedee’s
children,” nor the mother of John Mark, whose home at Jerusalem seems to
have been the meeting-place and the shelter of the early disciples, and
that in times of the most grievous persecution; nor yet “the elect lady
and her children,” whom not only St. John, “but also all they that know
the truth,” loved in truth (2 John 1), and her similarly elect sister
with her children (v 13), two notable instances will occur to the
reader.

The first of these presents a most touching instance of a mother’s
faith, and prayers, and labour of love, to which the only parallel in
later history is that of Monica, the mother of St. Augustine. How
Eunice, the daughter of the pious Lois, had come to marry a heathen,
<sup>**[<sup>37</sup>](#sdfootnote37sym)**</sup> we know as little as
the circumstances which may have originally led the family to settle at
Lystra (Acts 16:1; compare 14:6, etc.), a place where there was not even
a synagogue.

At most then two or three Jewish families lived in that heathen city.
Perhaps Lois and Eunice were the only worshippers of Jehovah there; for
we do not even read of a meeting-place for prayer, such as that by the
river-side where Paul first met Lydia. Yet in such adverse
circumstances, and as the wife of a Greek, Eunice proved one to whom
royal Lemuel’s praise applied in the fullest sense: “Her children arise
up and call her blessed,” and “Her works praise her in the gates”– of
the new Jerusalem.

Not a truer nor more touching portraiture of a pious Jewish home could
have been drawn than in these words of St. Paul: “I call to remembrance
the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy
grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice”; and again, “From a child thou
hast know the Holy Scriptures” (2 Tim 1:5, 3:15). There was, we repeat,
no synagogue in Lystra where Timothy might have heard every Sabbath, and
twice in the week, Moses and the Prophets read, and derived other
religious knowledge; there was, so far as we can see, neither religious
companionship nor means of instruction of any kind, nor religious
example, not even from his father; but all around quite the contrary.
But there was one influence for highest good–constant, unvarying, and
most powerful. It was that of “mother of Israel.” From the time that as
a “taph” he clung to her–even before that, when a “gamul,” an “olel,”
and a “jonek”–had Eunice trained Timothy in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord. To quote again the forcible language of St. Paul, “From an
infant” <sup>**[<sup>38</sup>](#sdfootnote38sym)**</sup> (or baby) “thou
hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto
salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.”

From the Apocrypha, from Josephus, and from the Talmud we know what
means of instruction in the Scriptures were within reach of a pious
mother at that time. In a house like that of Timothy’s father there
would, of course, be no phylacteries, with the portions of Scripture
which they contained, and probably no “Mesusah,” although, according to
the Mishnah (Ber. iii. 3), the latter duty was incumbent, not only upon
men but upon women. the Babylon Talmud (Ber. 20 b) indeed gives a very
unsatisfactory reason for the latter provision. But may it not be that
the Jewish law had such cases in view as that of Eunice and her son,
without expressly saying so, from fear of lending a sanction to mixed
marriages?

Be this as it may, we know that at the time of the Syrian persecutions,
just before the rising of the Maccabees, the possession of portions or
of the whole of the Old Testament by private families was common in
Israel. For, part of those persecutions consisted in making search for
these Scriptures and destroying them (1 Macc. i. 57), as well as
punishing their possessors (Josephus, Ant. xii, 256). Of course, during
the period of religious revival which followed the triumph of the
Maccabees, such copies of the Bible would have greatly multiplied.

It is by no means an exaggeration to say that, if perhaps only the
wealthy possessed a complete copy of the Old Testament, written out on
parchment or on Egyptian paper, there would scarcely be a pious home,
however humble, which did not cherish as its richest treasure some
portion of the Word of God–whether the five books of the Law, or the
Psalter, or a roll of one or more of the Prophets. Besides, we know from
the Talmud that at a later period, and probably at the time of Christ
also, there were little parchment rolls specially for the use of
children, containing such portions of Scripture as the “Shema”
<sup>**[<sup>39</sup>](#sdfootnote39sym)**</sup> (Deut 6:4-9, 11:13-21;
Num 15:37-41), the “Hallel” (Psa 113-118), the history of the Creation
to that of the Flood, and the first eight chapters of the book of
Leviticus. Such means of instruction there would be at the disposal of
Eunice in teaching her son.

And this leads us to mention, with due reverence, the other and far
greater New Testament instance of maternal influence in Israel. It is
none less than that of the mother of our blessed Lord Himself. While the
fact that Jesus became subject to His parents, and grew in wisdom and in
favour both with God and man, forms part of the unfathomable mystery of
His self-humiliation, the influence exerted upon His early education,
especially by His mother, seems implied throughout the gospel history.
Of course, His was a pious Jewish home; and at Nazareth there was a
synagogue, to which, as we shall by-and-by explain, a school was
probably attached. In that synagogue Moses and the Prophets would be
read, and, as afterwards by Himself (Luke 4:16), discourses or addresses
be delivered from time to time.

What was taught in these synagogue-schools, and how, will be shown in
another chapter. But, whether or not Jesus had attended such a school,
His mind was so thoroughly imbued with the Sacred Scriptures–He was so
familiar with them in their every detail–that we cannot fail to infer
that the home of Nazareth possessed a precious copy of its own of the
entire Sacred Volume, which from earliest childhood formed, so to speak,
the meat and drink of the God-Man. More than that, there is clear
evidence that He was familiar with the art of writing, which was by no
means so common in those days as reading.

The words of our Lord, as reported both by St. Matthew (Matt 5:18) and
by St. Luke (Luke 16:17), also prove that the copy of the Old Testament
from which He had drawn was not only in the original Hebrew, but
written, like our modern copies, in the so-called Assyrian, and not in
the ancient Hebrew-Phoenician characters. This appears from the
expression “one iota or one little hook”–erroneously rendered “tittle”
in our Authorised Version–which can only apply to the modern Hebrew
characters. That our Lord taught in Aramaean, and that He used and
quoted the Holy Scriptures in the Hebrew, perhaps sometimes rendering
them for popular use into Aramaean, there can be little doubt on the
part of careful and unprejudiced students, though some learned men have
held the opposite.

It is quite true that the Mishnah (Megill. i. 8) seems to allow the
writing of Holy Scripture in any language; but even Simeon, the son of
Gamaliel (the teacher of St. Paul), confined this concession to the
Greek–no doubt with a view to the LXX, which was so widely spread in his
time. But we also know from the Talmud, how difficult it was for a Rabbi
to defend the study or use of Greek, and how readily popular prejudice
burst into a universal and sweeping condemnation of it. The same
impression is conveyed not only from the immediate favourable change
which the use of the Aramaean by St. Paul produced upon the infuriated
people (Acts 21:40), but also from the fact that only an appeal to the
Hebrew Scriptures could have been of authority in discussion with the
Pharisees and Scribes, and that it alone gave point to the frequent
expostulations of Christ: “Have ye not read?” (Matt 12:3, 19:4, 21:13,
16, 42, 22:31).

This familiarity from earliest childhood with the Scriptures in the
Hebrew original also explains how at the age of twelve Jesus could be
found “in the Temple; sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
them and asking them questions” (Luke 2:46). In explaining this
seemingly strange circumstance, we may take the opportunity of
correcting an almost universal mistake. It is generally thought that, on
the occasion referred to, the Saviour had gone up, as being “of age,” in
the Jewish sense of the expression, or, to use their own terms, as a
“Bar Mizvah,” or “son of the commandment,” by which the period was
marked when religious obligations and privileges devolved upon a youth,
and he became a member of the congregation.

But the legal age for this was not twelve, but thirteen (Ab. v. 21). On
the other hand, the Rabbinical law enjoined (Yoma, 82 a) that even
before that–two years, or at least one year–lads should be brought up to
the Temple, and made to observe the festive rites. Unquestionably, it
was in conformity with this universal custom that Jesus went on the
occasion named to the Temple. Again, we know that it was the practice of
the members of the various Sanhedrims–who on ordinary days sat as
judicatories, from the close of the morning to the time of the evening
sacrifice (Sanh. 88 b)–to come out upon the Sabbaths and feast-days on
“the terrace of the Temple,” and there publicly to teach and expound,
the utmost liberty being given of asking questions, discussing,
objecting, and otherwise taking intelligent part in these lectures.

On the occasion of Christ’s presence, these discussions would, as usual,
be carried on during the “Moed Katon,” or minor festive days,
intervening between the second and the last day of the Paschal week.
Joseph and Mary, on the other hand, had, as allowed by the law, returned
towards Nazareth on the third day of the Paschal week, while Jesus
remained behind. These circumstances also explain why His appearance in
the midst of the doctors, although very remarkable considering His age,
did not at once command universal attention. In point of fact, the only
qualification requisite, so far as learning was concerned, would be a
thorough knowledge of the Scriptures in the Hebrew, and a proper
understanding of them.

What we have hitherto described will have conveyed to the reader that
the one branch of instruction aimed after or desired by the Jews at the
time of Christ was religious knowledge. What was understood by this, and
how it was imparted–whether in the family or in the public schools–must
form the subject of special investigation.

Chapter 8. Home Education; Female Education; Elementary Schools; Schoolmasters.
===============================================================================

If a faithful picture of society in ancient Greece or Rome were to be
presented to view, it is not easy to believe that even they who now most
oppose the Bible could wish their aims success. For this, at any rate,
may be asserted, without fear of gainsaying, that no other religion than
that of the Bible has proved competent to control an advanced, or even
an advancing, state of civilisation. Every other bound has been
successively passed and submerged by the rising tide; how deep only the
student of history knows. Two things are here undeniable. In the case of
heathenism every advance in civilisation has marked a progressive
lowering of public morality, the earlier stages of national life always
showing a far higher tone than the later. On the contrary, the religion
of the Bible (under the old as under the new dispensation) has
increasingly raised, if not uniformly the public morals, yet always the
tone and standard of public morality; it has continued to exhibit a
standard never yet attained, and it has proved its power to control
public and social life, to influence and to mould it.

Strange as it may sound, it is strictly true that, beyond the boundaries
of Israel, it would be scarcely possible to speak with any propriety of
family life, or even of the family, as we understand these terms. It is
significant, that the Roman historian Tacitus should mark it as
something special among the Jews
<sup>**[<sup>40</sup>](#sdfootnote40sym)**</sup>–which they only shared
with the ancient barbarian Germans–that they regarded it as a crime to
kill their offspring!

This is not the place to describe the exposure of children, or the
various crimes by which ancient Greece and Rome, in the days of their
highest culture, sought to rid themselves of what was regarded as
superfluous population. Few of those who have learned to admire
classical antiquity have a full conception of any one phase in its
social life–whether of the position of woman, the relation of the sexes,
slavery, the education of children, their relation to their parents, or
the state of public morality. Fewer still have combined all these
features into one picture, and that not merely as exhibited by the lower
orders, or even among the higher classes, but as fully owned and
approved by those whose names have descended in the admiration of ages
as the thinkers, the sages, the poets, the historians, and the statesmen
of antiquity. Assuredly, St. Paul’s description of the ancient world in
the first and second chapters of his Epistle to the Romans must have
appeared to those who lived in the midst of it as Divine even in its
tenderness, delicacy, and charity; the full picture under bright
sunlight would have been scarcely susceptible of exhibition. For such a
world there was only one alternative–either the judgment of Sodom, or
the mercy of the Gospel and the healing of the Cross.
<sup>**[<sup>41</sup>](#sdfootnote41sym)**</sup>

When we pass from the heathen world into the homes of Israel, even the
excess of their exclusiveness seems for the moment a relief. It is as if
we turned from enervating, withering, tropical heat into a darkened
room, whose grateful coolness makes us for the moment forget that its
gloom is excessive, and cannot continue as the day declines. And this
shutting out of all from without, this exclusiveness, applied not only
to what concerned their religion, their social and family life, but also
to their knowledge. In the days of Christ the pious Jew had no other
knowledge, neither sought nor cared for any other–in fact, denounced
it–than that of the law of God.

At the outset, let it be remembered that, in heathenism, theology, or
rather mythology, had no influence whatever on thinking or life–was
literally submerged under their waves. To the pious Jew, on the
contrary, the knowledge of God was everything; and to prepare for or
impart that knowledge was the sum total, the sole object of his
education. This was the life of his soul–the better, and only true life,
to which all else as well as the life of the body were merely
subservient, as means towards an end. His religion consisted of two
things: knowledge of God, which by a series of inferences, one from the
other, ultimately resolved itself into theology, as they understood it;
and service, which again consisted of the proper observance of all that
was prescribed by God, and of works of charity towards men–the latter,
indeed, going beyond the bound of what was strictly due (the Chovoth)
into special merit or “righteousness” (Zedakah).

But as service presupposed knowledge, theology was again at the
foundation of all, and also the crown of all, which conferred the
greatest merit. This is expressed or implied in almost innumerable
passages of Jewish writings. Let one suffice, not only because it sounds
more rationalistic, but because it is to this day repeated each morning
in his prayers by every Jew: “These are the things of which a man eats
the fruit in this world, but their possession continueth for the next
world: to honour father and mother, pious works, peacemaking between man
and man, and the study of the law, which is equivalent to them all”
(Peah. i. 1).

And literally “equivalent to them all” was such study to the Jew. The
circumstances of the times forced him to learn Greek, perhaps also
Latin, so much as was necessary for intercourse; and to tolerate at
least the Greek translation of the Scriptures, and the use of any
language in the daily prayers of the Shema, of the eighteen
benedictions, and of the grace after meat (these are the oldest elements
of the Jewish liturgy). But the blessing of the priests might not be
spoken, nor the phylacteries nor the Mesusah written, in other than the
Hebrew language (Megil. i. 8; Sotah, vii. 1, 2); while heathen science
and literature were absolutely prohibited.

To this, and not to the mere learning of Greek, which must have been
almost necessary for daily life, refer such prohibitions as that traced
to the time of Titus (Sotah, ix. 14), forbidding a man to teach his son
Greek. The Talmud itself (Men. 99 b) furnishes a clever illustration of
this, when, in reply to the question of a younger Rabbi, whether, since
he knew the whole “Thorah” (the law), he might be allowed to study
“Greek wisdom,” his uncle reminded him of the words (Josh 1:8), “Thou
shalt meditate therein day and night.” “Go, then, and consider,” said
the older Rabbi, “which is the hour that is neither of the day nor of
the night, and in it thou mayest study Grecian wisdom.”

This, then, was one source of danger averted. Then, as for the
occupations of ordinary life, it was indeed quite true that every Jew
was bound to learn some trade or business. But this was not to divert
him from study; quite the contrary. It was regarded as a profanation–or
at least declared such–to make use of one’s learning for secular
purposes, whether of gain or of honour. The great Hillel had it (Ab. i.
13): “He who serves himself by the crown (the ‘Thorah’) shall fade
away.” To this Rabbi Zadok added the warning, “Make study neither a
crown by which to shine, nor yet a spade with which to dig”–the Mishnah
inferring that such attempts would only lead to the shortening of life
(Ab. iv. 5).

All was to be merely subsidiary to the one grand object; the one was of
time, the other of eternity; the one of the body, the other of the soul;
and its use was only to sustain the body, so as to give free scope to
the soul on its upward path. Every science also merged in theology. Some
were not so much sciences as means of livelihood, such as medicine and
surgery; others were merely handmaidens to theology. Jurisprudence was
in reality a kind of canon law; mathematics and astronomy were
subservient to the computations of the Jewish calendar; literature
existed not outside theological pursuits; and as for history, geography,
or natural studies, although we mark, in reference to the latter, a
keenness of observation which often led instinctively to truth, we meet
with so much ignorance, and with so many gross mistakes and fables, as
almost to shake the belief of the student in the trustworthiness of any
Rabbinical testimony.

From what has been stated, three inferences will be gathered, all of
most material bearing on the study of the New Testament. It will be seen
how a mere knowledge of the law came to hold such place of almost
exclusive importance that its successful prosecution seemed to be
well-nigh all in all. Again, it is easy now to understand why students
and teachers of theology enjoyed such exceptional honour (Matt 23:6,7:
Mark 12:38,39: Luke 11:43, 20:46). In this respect the testimonies of
Onkelos, in his paraphrastic rendering of the Scriptures, of the oldest
“Targumim,” or paraphrastic commentaries, of the Mishnah, and of the two
Talmuds, are not only unanimous, but most extravagant.

Not only are miracles supposed to be performed in attestation of certain
Rabbis, but such a story is actually ventured upon (Bab. Mes. 86 a), as
that on the occasion of a discussion in the academy of heaven, when the
Almighty and His angels were of different opinions in regard to a
special point of law, a Rabbi famed for his knowledge of that subject
was summoned up by the angel of death to decide the matter between them!
The story is altogether too blasphemous for details, and indeed the
whole subject is too wide for treatment in this connection. If such was
the exalted position of a Rabbi, this direction of the Mishnah seems
quite natural, that in case of loss, of difficulties, or of captivity, a
teacher was to be cared for before a father, since to the latter we owed
only our existence in this world, but to the former the life of the
world to come (Bab. Mez. ii. 11).

It is curious how in this respect also Roman Catholicism and Pharisaism
arrive at the same ultimate results. Witness this saying of the
celebrated Rabbi, who flourished in the thirteenth century, and whose
authority is almost absolute among the Jews. The following is his
glossary on Deuteronomy 17:11: “Even if a Rabbi were to teach that your
left hand was the right, and your right hand the left, you are bound to
obey.”

The third inference which the reader will draw is as to the influence
which such views must have exercised upon education, alike at home and
in schools. It is no doubt only the echo of the most ancient mode of
congratulating a parent when to this day those who are present at a
circumcision, and also the priest when the first-born is redeemed from
him, utter this: “As this child has been joined to the covenant” (or, as
the case may be, “attained this redemption”), “so may it also be to him
in reference to the ‘thorah,’ the ‘chuppah’ (the marriage-baldacchino,
under which the regular marriage ceremony is performed), and to good
works.” The wish marks with twofold emphasis the life that is to come,
as compared with the life that now is. This quite agrees with the
account of Josephus, who contrasts the heathen festivals at the birth of
children with the Jewish enactments by which children were from their
very infancy nourished up in the laws of God (Ag. Apion, i, 38-68, ii,
173-205).

There can be no question that, according to the law of Moses, the early
education of a child devolved upon the father; of course, always bearing
in mind that his first training would be the mother’s (Deu 11:19, and
many other passages). If the father were not capable of elementary
teaching, a stranger would be employed. Passing over the Old Testament
period, we may take it that, in the days of Christ, home-teaching
ordinarily began when the child was about three years old. There is
reason for believing that, even before this, that careful training of
the memory commenced, which has ever since been one of the mental
characteristics of the Jewish nation.

Verses of Scripture, benedictions, wise sayings, etc., were impressed on
the child, and mnemonic rules devised to facilitate the retention of
what was so acquired. We can understand the reason of this from the
religious importance attaching to the exact preservation of the very
words of tradition. The Talmud describes the beau ideal of a student
when it compares him to a well-plastered cistern, which would not let
even a single drop escape. Indeed, according to the Mishnah, he who from
negligence “forgets any one thing in his study of the Mishnah, Scripture
imputes it to him as if he had forfeited his life”; the reference here
being to Deuteronomy 4:9 (Ab. iii. 10). And so we may attach some credit
even to Josephus’ boast about his “wonderful memory” (Life, ii, 8).

In teaching to read, the alphabet was to be imparted by drawing the
letters on a board, till the child became familiar with them. Next, the
teacher would point in the copy read with his finger, or, still better,
with a style, to keep up the attention of the pupil. None but
well-corrected manuscripts were to be used, since, as was rightly said,
mistakes impressed upon the young mind were afterwards not easily
corrected. To acquire fluency, the child should be made to read aloud.
Special care was to be bestowed on the choice of good language, in which
respect, as we know, the inhabitants of Judaea far excelled those of
Galilee, who failed not only in elegance of diction, but even in their
pronunciation.

At five years of age the Hebrew Bible was to be begun; commencing,
however, not with the book of Genesis, but with that of Leviticus. This
not to teach the child his guilt, and the need of justification, but
rather because Leviticus contained those ordinances which it behoved a
Jew to know as early as possible. The history of Israel would probably
have been long before imparted orally, as it was continually repeated on
all festive occasions, as well as in the synagogue.

It has been stated in a former chapter that writing was not so common an
accomplishment as reading. Undoubtedly, the Israelites were familiar
with it from the very earliest period of their history, whether or not
they had generally acquired the art in Egypt. We read of the graving of
words on the gems of the high-priest’s breastplate, of the record of the
various genealogies of the tribes, etc; while such passages as
Deuteronomy 6:9, 11:20, 24:1, 3, imply that the art was not confined to
the priesthood (Num 5:23), but was known to the people generally. Then
we are told of copies of the law (Deu 17:18, 28:58, etc.), while in
Joshua 10:13 we have a reference to a work called “the book of Jasher.”
In Joshua 18:9 we find mention of a description of Palestine “in a
book,” and in 24:26 of what Joshua “wrote in the book of the law of
God.”

From Judges 8:14 (margin) it would appear that in the time of Gideon the
art of writing was very generally known. After that, instances occur so
frequently and applied to so many relationships, that the reader of the
Old Testament can have no difficulty in tracing the progress of the art.
This is not the place to follow the subject farther, nor to describe the
various materials employed at that time, nor the mode of lettering. At a
much later period the common mention of “scribes” indicates the popular
need of such a class. We can readily understand that the Oriental mind
would delight in writing enigmatically, that is, conveying by certain
expressions a meaning to the initiated which the ordinary reader would
miss, or which, at any rate, would leave the explanation to the exercise
of ingenuity. Partially in the same class we might reckon the custom of
designating a word by its initial letter. All theses were very early in
practice, and the subject has points of considerable interest.

Another matter deserves more serious attention. It will scarcely be
credited how general the falsification of signatures and documents had
become. Josephus mentions it (Ant. xvi, 317-319); and we know that St.
Paul was obliged to warn the Thessalonians against it (2 Thess 2:2), and
at last to adopt the device of signing every letter which came from
himself. There are scarcely any ancient Rabbinical documents which have
not been interpolated by later writers, or, as we might euphemistically
call it, been recast and re-edited. In general, it is not difficult to
discover such additions; although the vigilance and acuteness of the
critical scholar are specially required in this direction to guard
against rash and unwarrantable inferences. But without entering on such
points, it may interest the reader to know what writing materials were
employed in New Testament times. In Egypt red ink seems to have been
used; but assuredly the ink mentioned in the New Testament was black, as
even the term indicates (“melan,” 2 Cor 3:3; 2 John 12; 3 John 13).

Josephus speaks of writing in gold letters (Ant. xii, 324-329); and in
the Mishnah (Meg. ii. 2) we read of mixed colours, of red, of
sympathetic ink, and of certain chemical compositions. Reed quills are
mentioned in 3 John 13. The best of these came from Egypt; and the use
of a penknife would of course be indispensable. Paper (from the Egyptian
“papyrus”) is mentioned in 2 John 12; parchment in 2 Timothy 4:13. Of
this there were three kinds, according as the skin was used either
whole, or else split up into an outer and an inner skin. The latter was
used for the Mesusah. Shorter memoranda were made on tablets, which in
the Mishnah (Shab. xii. 4) bear the same names as in Luke 1:63.

Before passing to an account of elementary schools, it may be well, once
and for all, to say that the Rabbis did not approve of the same amount
of instruction being given to girls as to boys. More particularly they
disapproved of their engaging in legal studies–partly because they
considered woman’s mission and duties as lying in other directions,
partly because the subjects were necessarily not always suitable for the
other sex, partly because of the familiar intercourse between the sexes
to which such occupations would have necessarily led, and finally–shall
we say it?–because the Rabbis regarded woman’s mind as not adapted for
such investigations.

The unkindest thing, perhaps, which they said on this score was, “Women
are of a light mind”; though in its oft repetition the saying almost
reads like a semi-jocular way of cutting short a subject on which
discussion is disagreeable. However, instances of Rabbinically learned
women do occur. What their Biblical knowledge and what their religious
influence was, we learn not only from the Rabbis, but from the New
Testament. Their attendance at all public and domestic festivals, and in
the synagogues, and the circumstance that certain injunctions and
observances of Rabbinic origin devolved upon them also, prove that,
though not learned in the law, there must have been among them not a few
who, like Lois and Eunice, could train a child in the knowledge of the
Scripture, or, like Priscilla, be qualified to explain even to an
Apollos the way of God more perfectly.

Supposing, then, a child to be so far educated at home; suppose him,
also, to be there continually taught the commandments and observances,
and, as the Talmud expressly states, to be encouraged to repeat the
prayers aloud, so as to accustom him to it. At six years of age he would
be sent to school; not to an academy, or “beth hammedrash,” which he
would only attend if he proved apt and promising; far less to the
class-room of a great Rabbi, or the discussions of the Sanhedrim, which
marked a very advanced stage of study.

We are here speaking only of primary or elementary schools, such as even
in the time of our Lord were attached to every synagogue in the land.
Passing over the supposed or real Biblical notices of schools, and
confining our attention strictly to the period ending with the
destruction of the Temple, we have first a notice in the Talmud (Bab. B.
21 b), ascribing to Ezra an ordinance, that as many schoolmasters as
chose should be allowed to establish themselves in any place, and that
those who had formerly been settled there might not interfere with them.
In all likelihood this notice should not be taken in its literal sense,
but as an indication that the encouragement of schools and of education
engaged the attention of Ezra and of his successors.

Of the Grecianised academies which the wicked high-priest Jason tried to
introduce in Jerusalem (2 Macc iv. 12,13) we do not speak, because they
were anti-Jewish in their spirit, and that to such extent, that the
Rabbis, in order to “make a hedge,” forbade all gymnastic exercises. The
farther history and progress of Jewish schools are traced in the
following passage of the Talmud (Bab. B. 21 a): "If any one has merit,
and deserves that his name should be kept in remembrance, it is Joshua,
the son of Gamaliel. Without him the law would have fallen into oblivion
in Israel. For they used to rest on this saying of the law (Deu 11:19),
‘Ye shall teach them.’ Afterwards it was ordained that masters be
appointed at Jerusalem for the instruction of youth, as it is written
(Isa 2:3), ‘Out of Zion shall go forth the law.’ But even so the remedy
was not effectual, only those who had fathers being sent to school, and
the rest being neglected.

Hence it was arranged that Rabbis should be appointed in every district,
and that lads of sixteen or seventeen years should be sent to their
academies. But this institution failed, since every lad ran away if he
was chastised by his master. At last Joshua the son of Gamaliel
arranged, that in every province and in every town schoolmasters be
appointed, who should take charge of all boys from six or seven years of
age." We may add at once, that the Joshua here spoken of was probably
the high-priest of that name who flourished before the destruction of
the Temple, and that unquestionably this farther organisation implied at
least the existence of elementary schools at an earlier period.

Every place, then, which numbered twenty-five boys of a suitable age,
or, according to Maimonides, one hundred and twenty families, was bound
to appoint a schoolmaster. More than twenty-five pupils or thereabouts
he was not allowed to teach in a class. If there were forty, he had to
employ an assistant; if fifty, the synagogue authorities appointed two
teachers. This will enable us to understand the statement, no doubt
greatly exaggerated, that at the destruction of Jerusalem there were no
fewer than four hundred and eighty schools in the metropolis. From
another passage, which ascribes the fall of the Jewish state to the
neglect of the education of children, we may infer what importance
popular opinion attached to it.

But indeed, to the Jew, child-life was something peculiarly holy, and
the duty of filling it with thoughts of God specially sacred. It almost
seems as if the people generally had retained among them the echo of our
Lord’s saying, that their angels continually behold the face of our
Father which is in heaven. Hence the religious care connected with
education. The grand object of the teacher was moral as well as
intellectual training. To keep children from all intercourse with the
vicious; to suppress all feelings of bitterness, even though wrong had
been done to one’s parents; to punish all real wrong-doing; not to
prefer one child to another; rather to show sin in its repulsiveness
than to predict what punishment would follow, either in this or the next
world, so as not to “discourage” the child–such are some of the rules
laid down.

A teacher was not even to promise a child anything which he did not mean
to perform, lest its mind be familiarised with falsehood. Everything
that might call up disagreeable or indelicate thoughts was to be
carefully avoided. The teacher must not lose patience if his pupil
understood not readily, but rather make the lesson more plain. He might,
indeed, and he should, punish when necessary, and, as one of the Rabbis
put it, treat the child like a young heifer whose burden was daily
increased. But excessive severity was to be avoided; and we are told of
one teacher who was actually dismissed from office for this reason.
Where possible, try kindness; and if punishment was to be administered,
let the child be beaten with a strap, but never with a rod.

At ten the child began to study the Mishnah; at fifteen he must be ready
for the Talmud, which would be explained to him in a more advanced
academy. If after three, or at most five, years of tuition the child had
not made decided progress, there was little hope of his attaining to
eminence. In the study of the bible the pupil was to proceed from the
book of Leviticus to the rest of the Pentateuch, thence to the Prophets,
and lastly to the Hagiographa. This regulation was in accordance with
the degree of value which the Rabbis attached to these divisions of the
Bible. In the case of advanced pupils the day was portioned out–one part
being devoted to the Bible, the other two to the Mishnah and the Talmud.
Every parent was also advised to have his child taught swimming.

It has already been stated that in general the school was held in the
synagogue. Commonly its teacher was the “chazan,” or “minister” (Luke
4:20); by which expression we are to understand not a spiritual office,
but something like that of a beadle. This officer was salaried by the
congregation; nor was he allowed to receive fees from his pupils, lest
he should show favour to the rich. The expenses were met by voluntary
and charitable contributions; and in case of deficiency the most
distinguished Rabbis did not hesitate to go about and collect aid from
the wealthy.

The number of hours during which the junior classes were kept in school
was limited. As the close air of the school-room might prove injurious
during the heat of the day, lessons were intermitted between ten a.m.
and three p.m. For similar reasons, only four hours were allowed for
instruction between the seventeenth of Thamuz and the ninth of Ab (about
July and August), and teachers were forbidden to chastise their pupils
during these months. The highest honour and distinction attached to the
office of a teacher, if worthily discharged. Want of knowledge or of
method was regarded as sufficient cause for removing a teacher; but
experience was always deemed a better qualification than mere
acquirements. No teacher was employed who was not a married man.

To discourage unwholesome rivalry, and to raise the general educational
standard, parents were prohibited from sending their children to other
than the schools of their own towns.

A very beautiful trait was the care bestowed on the children of the poor
and on orphans. In the Temple there was a special receptacle–that “of
the secret”–for contributions, which were privately applied for the
education of the children of the pious poor. To adopt and bring up an
orphan was regarded as specially a “good work.” This reminds us of the
apostolic description of a “widow indeed,” as one “well reported for
good works”; who “had brought up children, lodged strangers, washed the
saints’ feet, relieved the afflicted, diligently followed every good
work” (1 Tim 5:10). Indeed, orphans were the special charge of the whole
congregation–not thrust into poor-houses,–and the parochial authorities
were even bound to provide a fixed dowry for female orphans.

Chapter 9. Mothers, Daughters, Wives in Israel
==============================================

In order accurately to understand the position of woman in Israel, it is
only necessary carefully to peruse the New Testament. The picture of
social life there presented gives a full view of the place which she
held in private and in public life. Here we do not find that separation,
so common among Orientals at all times, but a woman mingles freely with
others both at home and abroad. So far from suffering under social
inferiority, she takes influential and often leading part in all
movements, specially those of a religious character. Above all, we are
wholly spared those sickening details of private and public immorality
with which contemporary classical literature abounds.

Among Israel, woman was pure, the home happy, and the family hallowed by
a religion which consisted not only in public services, but entered into
daily life, and embraced in its observances every member of the
household. It was so not only in New Testament times but always in
Israel. St. Peter’s reference to “the holy women” “in the old time” (1
Peter 3:5) is thoroughly in accordance with Talmudical views. Indeed,
his quotation of Genesis 18:12, and its application: “Even as Sara
obeyed Abraham, calling him lord,” occur in precisely the same manner in
Rabbinical writings (Tanch. 28, 6), where her respect and obedience are
likewise set forth as a pattern to her daughters.
<sup>**[<sup>42</sup>](#sdfootnote42sym)**</sup>

Some further details may illustrate the matter better than arguments.
The creation of woman from the rib of Adam is thus commented on (Shab.
23): “It is as if Adam had exchanged a pot of earth for a precious
jewel.” This, although Jewish wit caustically had it: “God has cursed
woman, yet all the world runs after her; He has cursed the ground, yet
all the world lives of it.” In what reverence “the four mothers,” as the
Rabbis designate Sarah, Rebekah, Leah, and Rachel, were held, and what
influence they exercised in patriarchal history, no attentive reader of
Scripture can fail to notice.

And as we follow on the sacred story, Miriam, who had originally saved
Moses, leads the song of deliverance on the other side of the flood, and
her influence, though not always for good, continued till her death
(compare Micah 6:4). Then “the women whose heart stirred them up in
wisdom” contribute to the rearing of the Tabernacle; Deborah works
deliverance, and judgeth in Israel; and the piety of Manoah’s wife is at
least as conspicuous, and more intelligent, than her husband’s (Judg
13:23). So also is that of the mother of Samuel. In the times of the
kings the praises of Israel’s maidens stir the jealousy of Saul; Abigail
knows how to avert the danger of her husband’s folly; the wise woman of
Tekoah is sent for to induce the king to fetch his banished home; and
the conduct of a woman “in her wisdom” puts an end to the rebellion of
Sheba. Later on, the constant mention of queen mothers, and their
frequent interference in the government, shows their position.

Such names as that of Huldah the prophetess, and the idyllic narrative
of the Shunammite, will readily occur to the memory. The story of a
woman’s devotion forms the subject of the Book of Ruth; that of her pure
and faithful love, the theme or the imagery of the Song of Songs; that
of her courage and devotion the groundwork of the Book of Esther: while
her worth and virtues are enumerated in the closing chapter of the Book
of Proverbs.

Again, in the language of the prophets the people of God are called “the
daughter,” “the virgin daughter of Zion,” “the daughter of Jerusalem,”
“the daughter of Judah,” etc.; and their relationship to God is
constantly compared to that of the married state. The very terms by
which woman is named in the Old Testament are significant. If the man is
Ish, his wife is Ishah, simply his equal; if the husband is Gever, the
ruler, the woman is, in her own domain, Gevirah and Gevereth, the
mistress (as frequently in the history of Sarah and in other passages),
or else the dweller at home (Nevath bayith, Psa 68:12).
<sup>**[<sup>43</sup>](#sdfootnote43sym)**</sup>

Nor is it otherwise in New Testament times. The ministry of woman to our
blessed Lord, and in the Church, has almost become proverbial. Her
position there marks really not a progress upon, but the full carrying
out of, the Old Testament idea; or, to put the matter in another light,
we ask no better than that any one who is acquainted with classical
antiquity should compare what he reads of a Dorcas, of the mother of
Mark, of Lydia, Priscilla, Phoebe, Lois, or Eunice, with what he knows
of the noble women of Greece and Rome at that period.

Of course, against all this may be set the permission of polygamy, which
undoubtedly was in force at the time of our Lord, and the ease with
which divorce might be obtained. In reference to both these, however, it
must be remembered that they were temporary concessions to “the
hardness” of the people’s heart. For, not only must the circumstances of
the times and the moral state of the Jewish and of neighbouring nations
be taken into account, but there were progressive stages of spiritual
development. If these had not been taken into account, the religion of
the Old Testament would have been unnatural and an impossibility.

Suffice it, that “from the beginning it was not so,” nor yet intended to
be so in the end–the intermediate period thus marking the gradual
progress from the perfectness of the idea to the perfectness of its
realisation. Moreover, it is impossible to read the Old, and still more
the New Testament without gathering from it the conviction, that
polygamy was not the rule but the rare exception, so far as the people
generally were concerned. Although the practice in reference to divorce
was certainly more lax, even the Rabbis surrounded it with so many
safeguards that, in point of fact, it must in many cases have been
difficult of accomplishment. In general, the whole tendency of the
Mosaic legislation, and even more explicitly that of later Rabbinical
ordinances, was in the direction of recognising the rights of woman,
with a scrupulousness which reached down even to the Jewish slave, and a
delicacy that guarded her most sensitive feelings. Indeed, we feel
warranted in saying, that in cases of dispute the law generally lent to
her side.

Of divorce we shall have to speak in the sequel. But what the religious
views and feelings both about it and monogamy were at the time of
Malachi, appears from the pathetic description of the altar of God as
covered with the tears of “the wife of youth,” “the wife of thy
covenant,” “thy companion,” who had been “put away” or “treacherously
dealt” with (Mal 2:13 to end). The whole is so beautifully paraphrased
by the Rabbis that we subjoin it:

"If death hath snatched from thee the wife of youth,

It is as if the sacred city were,

And e’en the Temple, in thy pilgrim days,

Defiled, laid low, and levelled with the dust.

The man who harshly sends from him

His first-woo’d wife, the loving wife of youth,

For him the very altar of the Lord

Sheds forth its tears of bitter agony."

Where the social intercourse between the sexes was nearly as
unrestricted as among ourselves, so far as consistent with Eastern
manners, it would, of course, be natural for a young man to make
personal choice of his bride. Of this Scripture affords abundant
evidence. But, at any rate, the woman had, in case of betrothal or
marriage, to give her own free and expressed consent, without which a
union was invalid. Minors–in the case of girls up to twelve years and
one day–might be betrothed or given away by their father. In that case,
however, they had afterwards the right of insisting upon divorce.

Of course, it is not intended to convey that woman attained her full
position till under the New Testament. But this is only to repeat what
may be said of almost every social state and relationship. Yet it is
most marked how deeply the spirit of the Old Testament, which is
essentially that of the New also, had in this respect also penetrated
the life of Israel. St. Paul’s warning (2 Cor 6:14) against being
“unequally yoked together,” which is an allegorical application of
Leviticus 19:19; Deuteronomy 22:10, finds to some extent a counterpart
in mystical Rabbinical writings, where the last-mentioned passages is
expressly applied to spiritually unequal marriages. The admonition of 1
Corinthians 7:39 to marry “only in the Lord,” recalls many similar
Rabbinical warnings, from which we select the most striking.

Men, we are told (Yalkut on Deu 21:15), are wont to marry for one of
four reasons–for passion, wealth, honour, or the glory of God. As for
the first-named class of marriages, their issue must be expected to be
“stubborn and rebellious” sons, as we may gather from the section
referring to such following upon that in Deuteronomy 21:11. In regard to
marriages for wealth, we are to learn a lesson from the sons of Eli, who
sought to enrich themselves in such manner, but of whose posterity it
was said (1 Sam 2:36) that they should “crouch for a piece of silver and
a morsel of bread.”

Of marriages for the sake of connection, honour, and influence, King
Jehoram offered a warning, who became King Ahab’s son-in-law, because
that monarch had seventy sons, whereas upon his death his widow Athaliah
“arose and destroyed all the seed royal” (2 Kings 11:1). But far
otherwise is it in case of marriage “in the name of heaven.” The issue
of such will be children who “preserve Israel.” In fact, the Rabbinical
references to marrying “in the name of heaven,” or “for the name of
God,”–in God and for God–are so frequent and so emphatic, that the
expressions used by St. Paul must have come familiarly to him.

Again, much that is said in 1 Corinthians 7 about the married estate,
finds striking parallels in Talmudical writings. One may here be
mentioned, as explaining the expression (v 14): “Else were your children
unclean; but now are they holy.” Precisely the same distinction was made
by the Rabbis in regard to proselytes, whose children, if begotten
before their conversion to Judaism, were said to be “unclean”; if after
that event to have been born “in holiness,” only that, among the Jews,
both parents required to profess Judaism, while St. Paul argues in the
contrary direction, and concerning a far different holiness than that
which could be obtained through any mere outward ceremony.

Some further details, gathered almost at random, will give glimpses of
Jewish home life and of current views. It was by a not uncommon, though
irreverent, mode of witticism, that two forms of the same verb, sounding
almost alike, were made to express opposite experiences of marriage. It
was common to ask a newly-married husband: “Maza or Moze?”–“findeth” or
“found”; the first expression occurring in Proverbs 18:22, the second in
Ecclesiastes 7:26.

A different sentiment is the following from the Talmud (Yeb. 62 b; Sanh.
76 b), the similarity of which to Ephesians 5:28 will be immediately
recognised: “He that loveth his wife as his own body, honoureth her more
than his own body, brings up his children in the right way, and leads
them in it to full age–of him the Scripture saith: ‘Thou shalt know that
thy tabernacle shall be in peace’ (Job 5:24).” Of all qualities those
most desired in woman were meekness, modesty, and shamefacedness.
Indeed, brawling, gossip in the streets, and immodest behaviour in
public were sufficient grounds for divorce. Of course, Jewish women
would never have attempted “teaching” in the synagogue, where they
occupied a place separate from the men–for Rabbinical study, however
valued for the male sex, was disapproved of in the case of women. Yet
this direction of St. Paul (1 Tim 2:12): “I suffer not a woman to usurp
authority over the man” findeth some kind of parallel in the Rabbinical
saying: “Whoever allows himself to be ruled by his wife, shall call out,
and no one will make answer to him.”

It is on similar grounds that the Rabbis argue, that man must seek after
woman, and not a woman after a man; only the reason which they assign
for it sounds strange. Man, they say, was formed from the ground–woman
from man’s rib; hence, in trying to find a wife man only looks after
what he had lost! This formation of man from soft clay, and of woman
from a hard bone, also illustrated why man was so much more easily
reconcilable than woman.

Similarly, it was observed, that God had not formed woman out of the
head, lest she should become proud; nor out of the eye, lest she should
lust; nor out of the ear, lest she should be curious; nor out of the
mouth, lest she should be talkative; nor out of the heart, lest she
should be jealous; nor out of the hand, lest she should be covetous; nor
out of the foot, lest she be a busybody; but out of the rib, which was
always covered. Modesty was, therefore, a prime quality. It was no doubt
chiefly in jealous regard for this, that women were interdicted engaging
in Rabbinical studies; and a story is related to show how even the
wisest of women, Beruria, was thereby brought to the brink of extreme
danger.

It is not so easy to explain why women were dispensed from all positive
obligations (commands, but not prohibitions) that were not general in
their bearing (Kidd. 1. 7,8), but fixed to certain periods of time (such
as wearing the phylacteries, etc.), and from that of certain prayers,
unless it be that woman was considered not her own mistress but subject
to others, or else that husband and wife were regarded as one, so that
his merits and prayers applied to her as well. Indeed, this view, at
least so far as the meritorious nature of a man’s engagement with the
law is concerned, is expressly brought forward, and women are
accordingly admonished to encourage their husbands in all such studies.

We can understand how, before the coming of the Messiah, marriage should
have been looked upon as of religious obligation. Many passages of
Scripture were at least quoted in support of this idea. Ordinarily, a
young man was expected to enter the wedded state (according to
Maimonides) at the age of sixteen or seventeen, while the age of twenty
may be regarded as the utmost limit conceded, unless study so absorbed
time and attention as to leave no leisure for the duties of married
life.

Still it was thought better even to neglect study than to remain single.
Yet money cares on account of wife and children were dreaded. The same
comparison is used in reference to them, which our Lord applies to quite
a different “offence,” that against the “little ones” (Luke 17:2). Such
cares are called by the Rabbis, “a millstone round the neck” (Kidd. 29
b). In fact, the expression seems to have become proverbial, like so
many others which are employed in the New Testament.

We read in the Gospel that, when the Virgin-mother “was espoused to
Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy
Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily” (Matt
1:18,19). The narrative implies a distinction between betrothal and
marriage–Joseph being at the time betrothed, but not actually married to
the Virgin-mother.

Even in the Old Testament a distinction is made between betrothal and
marriage. The former was marked by a bridal present (or Mohar, Gen
34:12; Exo 22:17; 1 Sam 18:25), with which the father, however, would in
certain circumstances dispense. From the moment of her betrothal a woman
was treated as if she were actually married. The union could not be
dissolved, except by regular divorce; breach of faithfulness was
regarded as adultery; and the property of the women became virtually
that of her betrothed, unless he had expressly renounced it (Kidd. ix.
1). But even in that case he was her natural heir. It is impossible here
to enter into the various legal details, as, for example, about property
or money which might come to a woman after betrothal or marriage.

The law adjudicated this to the husband, yet with many restrictions, and
with infinite delicacy towards the woman, as if reluctant to put in
force the rights of the stronger (Kidd. viii. 1, etc.). From the Mishnah
(Bab. B. x. 4) we also learn that there were regular Shitre Erusin, or
writings of betrothal, drawn up by the authorities (the costs being paid
by the bridegroom). These stipulated the mutual obligations, the dowry,
and all other points on which the parties had agreed. The Shitre Erusin
were different from the regular Chethubah (literally, writing), or
marriage contract, without which the Rabbis regarded a marriage as
merely legalised concubinage (Cheth. v. 1).

The Chethubah provided a settlement of at least two hundred denars for a
maiden, and one hundred denars for a widow, while the priestly council
at Jerusalem fixed four hundred denars for a priest’s daughter. Of
course these sums indicate only the legal minimum, and might be
increased indefinitely at pleasure, though opinions differ whether any
larger sums might be legally exacted, if matters did not go beyond
betrothal. The form at present in use among the Jews sets forth, that
the bridegroom weds his bride “according to the law of Moses and of
Israel”; that he promises “to please, to honour, to nourish, and to care
for her, as is the manner of the men of Israel,” adding thereto the
woman’s consent, the document being signed by two witnesses. In all
probability this was substantially the form in olden times. In Jerusalem
and in Galilee–where it was said that men in their choice had regard to
“a fair degree,” while in the rest of Judaea they looked a good deal
after money–widows had the right of residence in their husband’s house
secured to them.

On the other hand, a father was bound to provide a dowry (nedan,
nedanjah) for his daughter conformable to her station in life; and a
second daughter could claim a portion equal to that of her elder sister,
or else one-tenth of all immovable property. In case of the father’s
death, the sons, who, according to Jewish law, were his sole heirs, were
bound to maintain their sisters, even though this would have thrown them
upon public charity, and to endow each with a tenth part of what had
been left.

The dowry, whether in money, property, or jewellery, was entered into
the marriage contract, and really belonged to the wife, the husband
being obliged to add to it one-half more, if it consisted of money or
money’s value; and if of jewellery, etc., to assign to her four-fifths
of its value. In case of separation (not divorce) he was bound to allow
her a proper aliment, and to re-admit her to his table and house on the
Sabbath-eve. A wife was entitled to one-tenth of her dowry for
pin-money. If a father gave away his daughter without any distinct
statement about her dowry, he was bound to allow her at least fifty sus;
and if it had been expressly stipulated that she was to have no dowry at
all, it was delicately enjoined that the bridegroom should, before
marriage, give her sufficient for the necessary outfit.

An orphan was to receive a dowry of at least fifty sus from the
parochial authorities. A husband could not oblige his wife to leave the
Holy Land nor the city of Jerusalem, nor yet to change a town for a
country residence, or vice versa, nor a good for a bad house. These are
only a few of the provisions which show how carefully the law protected
the interests of women. To enter into farther details would lead beyond
our present object. All this was substantially settled at the betrothal,
which, in Judaea at least, seems to have been celebrated by a feast.
Only a bona fide breach of these arrangements, or wilful fraud, was
deemed valid ground for dissolving the bond once formed. Otherwise, as
already noted, a regular divorce was necessary.

According to Rabbinical law certain formalities were requisite to make a
betrothal legally valid. These consisted either in handing to a woman,
directly or through messengers, a piece of money, however small, or else
a letter, <sup>**[<sup>44</sup>](#sdfootnote44sym)**</sup> provided it
were in each case expressly stated before witnesses, that the man
thereby intended to espouse the woman as his wife.

The marriage followed after a longer or shorter interval, the limits of
which, however, were fixed by law. The ceremony itself consisted in
leading the bride into the house of the bridegroom, with certain
formalities, mostly dating from very ancient times. Marriage with a
maiden was commonly celebrated on a Wednesday afternoon, which allowed
the first days of the week for preparation, and enabled the husband, if
he had a charge to prefer against the previous chastity of his bride, to
make immediate complaint before the local Sanhedrim, which sat every
Thursday.

On the other hand, the marriage of a widow was celebrated on Thursday
afternoon, which left three days of the week for “rejoicing with her.”
This circumstance enables us, with some certainty, to arrange the date
of the events which preceded the marriage in Cana. Inferring from the
accompanying festivities that it was the marriage of a maiden, and
therefore took place on a Wednesday, we have the following succession of
events:–On Thursday (beginning as every Jewish day with the previous
evenint), testimony of the Baptist to the Sanhedrim-deputation from
Jerusalem.

On Friday (John 1:29), “John seeth Jesus coming unto him,” and
significantly preacheth the first sermon about “the Lamb of God which
taketh away the sin of the world.” On Saturday (v 35), John’s second
sermon on the same text; the consequent conversion of St. John and St.
Andrew, and the calling of St. Peter. On Sunday (v 43), our Lord Himself
preacheth His first Messianic sermon, and calls Philip and Nathanael. On
“the third day” after it, that is, on Wednesday, was the marriage in
Cana of Galilee. The significance of these dates, when compared with
those in the week of our Lord’s Passion, will be sufficiently evident.

But this is not all that may be learned from the account of the marriage
in Cana. Of course, there was a “marriage-feast,” as on all these
occasions. For this reason, marriages were not celebrated either on the
Sabbath, or on the day before or after it, lest the Sabbath-rest should
be endangered. Nor was it lawful to wed on any of the three annual
festivals, in order, as the Rabbis put it, “not to mingle one joy (that
of the marriage) with another (that of the festival).” As it was deemed
a religious duty to give pleasure to the newly-married couple, the
merriment at times became greater than the more strict Rabbis approved.

Accordingly, it is said of one, that to produce gravity he broke a vase
worth about 25 pounds; of another, that at his son’s wedding he broke a
costly glass; and of a third, that being asked to sin, he exclaimed, Woe
to us, for we must all die! For, as it is added (Ber. 31 a): “It is
forbidden to man, that his mouth be filled with laughter in this world
(dispensation), as it is written, ‘Then our mouth was filled with
laughter, and our tongue with singing.’ When is that to be? At the time
when ‘they shall sing among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things
for them.’”

It deserves notice, that at the marriage in Cana there is no mention of
“the friends of the bridegroom,” or, as we would call them, the
groomsmen. This was in strict accordance with Jewish custom, for
groomsmen were customary in Judaea, but not in Galilee (Cheth. 25 a).
This also casts light upon the locality where John 3:29 was spoken, in
which “the friend of the bridegroom” is mentioned. But this expression
is quite different from that of “children of the bridechamber,” which
occurs in Matthew 9:15, where the scene is once more laid in Galilee.

The term “children of the bridechamber” is simply a translation of the
Rabbinical “bene Chuppah,” and means the guests invited to the bridal.
In Judaea there were at every marriage two groomsmen or “friends of the
bridegroom”–one for the bridegroom, the other for his bride. Before
marriage, they acted as a kind of intermediaries between the couple; at
the wedding they offered gifts, waited upon the bride and bridegroom,
and attended them to the bridal chamber, being also, as it were, the
guarantors of the bride’s virgin chastity.

Hence, when St. Paul tells the Corinthians (2 Cor 11:2): “I am jealous
over you with godly jealousy; for I have espoused you to one husband,
that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,” he speaks, as it
were, in the character of groomsman or “bridegroom’s friend,” who had
acted as such at the spiritual union of Christ with the Corinthian
Church. And we know that it was specially the duty of the “friend of the
bridegroom” so to present to him his bride. Similarly it was his also,
after marriage, to maintain proper terms between the couple, and more
particularly to defend the good fame of the bride against all
imputations.

It may interest some to know that his custom also was traced up to
highest authority. Thus, in the spiritual union of Israel with their
God, Moses is spoken of as “the friend of the bridegroom” who leads out
the bride (Exo 19:17); while Jehovah, as the bridegroom, meets His
Church at Sinai (Psa 68:7; Pirke di R. El. 41). Nay, in some mystic
writings God is described as acting “the friend of the bridegroom,” when
our first parents met in Eden. There is a touch of poetry in the
application of Ezekiel 28:13 to that scene, when angels led the choir,
and decked and watched the bridal-bed (Ab. de R. Nathan iv. and xii.).
According to another ancient Rabbinical commentary (Ber. R. viii), God
Almighty Himself took the cup of blessing and spoke the benediction,
while Michael and Gabriel acted the “bridegroom’s friends” to our first
parents when they wedded in Paradise.

With such a “benediction,” preceded by a brief formula, with which the
bride was handed over to her husband (Tobit vii. 13), the wedding
festivities commenced. And so the pair were led towards the bridal
chamber (Cheder) and the bridal bed (Chuppah). The bride went with her
hair unloosed. Ordinarily, it was most strictly enjoined upon women to
have their head and hair carefully covered. This may throw some light
upon the difficult passage, 1 Corinthians 11:1-10. We must bear in mind
that the apostle there argues with Jews, and that on their own ground,
convincing them by a reference to their own views, customs, and legends
of the propriety of the practice which he enjoins.

From that point of view the propriety of a woman having her head
“covered” could not be called in question. The opposite would, to a Jew,
have indicated immodesty. Indeed, it was the custom in the case of a
woman accused of adultery to have her hair “shorn or shaven,” at the
same time using this formula: “Because thou hast departed from the
manner of the daughters of Israel, who go with their head
covered;…therefore that has befallen thee which thou hast chosen.” This
so far explains verses 5 and 6. The expression “power,” as applied in
verse 10 to the head of woman, seems to refer to this covering,
indicating, as it did, that she was under the power of her husband,
while the very difficult addition, “because of the angels,” may either
allude to the presence of the angels and to the well-known Jewish view
(based, no doubt, on truth) that those angels may be grieved or offended
by our conduct, and bear the sad tidings before the throne of God, or it
may possibly refer to the very ancient Jewish belief, that the evil
spirits gained power over a woman who went with her head bare.

The custom of a bridal veil–either for the bride alone, or spread over
the couple–was of ancient date. It was interdicted for a time by the
Rabbis after the destruction of Jerusalem. Still more ancient was the
wearing of crowns (Cant 3:11; Isa 61:10; Eze 16:12), which was also
prohibited after the last Jewish war. Palm and myrtle branches were
borne before the couple, grain or money was thrown about, and music
preceded the procession, in which all who met it were, as a religious
duty, expected to join. The Parable of the Ten Virgins, who, with their
lamps, were in expectancy of the bridegroom (Matt 25:1), is founded on
Jewish custom. For, according to Rabbinical authority, such lamps
carried on the top of staves were frequently used, while ten is the
number always mentioned in connection with public solemnities.
<sup>**[<sup>45</sup>](#sdfootnote45sym)**</sup> The marriage
festivities generally lasted a week, but the bridal days extended over a
full month. <sup>**[<sup>46</sup>](#sdfootnote46sym)**</sup>

Having entered thus fully on the subject of marriage, a few further
particulars may be of interest. The bars to marriage mentioned in the
Bible are sufficiently known. To these the Rabbis added others, which
have been arranged under two heads–as farther extending the laws of
kindred (to their secondary degrees), and as intended to guard morality.
The former were extended over the whole line of forbidden kindred, where
that line was direct, and to one link farther where the line became
indirect–as, for example, to the wife of a maternal uncle, or to the
step- mother of a wife. In the category of guards to morality we include
such prohibitions as that a divorced woman might not marry her seducer,
nor a man the woman to whom he had brought her letter of divorce, or in
whose case he had borne testimony; or of marriage with those not in
their right senses, or in a state of drunkenness; or of the marriage of
minors, or under fraud, etc.

A widower had to wait over three festivals, a widow three months, before
re-marrying, or if she was with child or gave suck, for two years. A
woman might not be married a third time; no marriage could take place
within thirty days of the death of a near relative, nor yet on the
Sabbath, nor on a feast-day, etc. Of the marriage to a deceased
husband’s brother (or the next of kin), in case of childlessness, it is
unnecessary here to speak, since although the Mishnah devotes a whole
tractate to it (Yebamoth), and it was evidently customary at the time of
Christ (Mark 12:19, etc.), the practice was considered as connected with
the territorial possession of Palestine, and ceased with the destruction
of the Jewish commonwealth (Bechar. i. 7). A priest was to inquire into
the legal descent of his wife (up to four degrees if the daughter of a
priest, otherwise up to five degrees), except where the bride’s father
was a priest in actual service, or a member of the Sanhedrim. The
high-priest’s bride was to be a maid not older than six months beyond
her puberty.

The fatal ease with which divorce could be obtained, and its frequency,
appear from the question addressed to Christ by the Pharisees: “Is it
lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?” (Matt 19:3), and
still more from the astonishment with which the disciples had listened
to the reply of the Saviour (v 10). That answer was much wider in its
range than our Lord’s initial teaching in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt
5:32). To the latter no Jew could have had any objection, even though
its morality would have seemed elevated beyond their highest standard,
represented in this case by the school of Shammai, while that of Hillel,
and still more Rabbi Akiba, presented the lowest opposite extreme. But
in reply to the Pharisees, our Lord placed the whole question on grounds
which even the strictest Shammaite would have refused to adopt.

For the farthest limit to which he would have gone would have been to
restrict the cause of divorce to “a matter of uncleanness” (Deu 24:1),
by which he would probably have understood not only a breach of the
marriage vow, but of the laws and customs of the land. In fact, we know
that it included every kind of impropriety, such as going about with
loose hair, spinning in the street, familiarly talking with men,
ill-treating her husband’s parents in his presence, brawling, that is,
“speaking to her husband so loudly that the neighbours could hear her in
the adjoining house” (Chethub. vii. 6), a general bad reputation, or the
discovery of fraud before marriage.

On the other hand, the wife could insist on being divorced if her
husband were a leper, or affected with polypus, or engaged in a
disagreeable or dirty trade, such as that of a tanner or coppersmith.
One of the cases in which divorce was obligatory was, if either party
had become heretical, or ceased to profess Judaism. But even so, there
were at least checks to the danger of general lawlessness, such as the
obligation of paying to a wife her portion, and a number of minute
ordinances about formal letters of divorce, without which no divorce was
legal, <sup>**[<sup>47</sup>](#sdfootnote47sym)**</sup> and which had to
be couched in explicit terms, handed to the woman herself, and that in
presence of two witnesses, etc.

According to Jewish law there were four obligations incumbent on a wife
towards her husband, and ten by which he was bound. Of the latter, three
are referred to in Exodus 21:9, 10; the other seven include her
settlement, medical treatment in case of sickness, redemption from
captivity, a respectable funeral, provision in his house so long as she
remained a widow and had not been paid her dowry, the support of her
daughters till they were married, and a provision that her sons should,
besides receiving their portion of the father’s inheritance, also share
in what had been settled upon her. The obligations upon the wife were,
that all her gains should belong to her husband, as also what came to
her after marriage by inheritance; that the husband should have the
usufruct of her dowry, and of any gains by it, provided he had the
administration of it, in which case, however, he was also responsible
for any loss; and that he should be considered her heir-at-law.

What the family life among the godly in Israel must have been, how
elevated its tone, how loving its converse, or how earnestly devoted its
mothers and daughters, appears sufficiently from the gospel story, from
that in the book of Acts, and from notices in the apostolic letters.
Women, such as the Virgin-mother, or Elisabeth, or Anna, or those who
enjoyed the privilege of ministering to the Lord, or who, after His
death, tended and watched for His sacred body, could not have been quite
solitary in Palestine; we find their sisters in a Dorcas, a Lydia, a
Phoebe, and those women of whom St. Paul speaks in Philippians 4:3, and
whose lives he sketches in his Epistles to Timothy and Titus.

Wives such as Priscilla, mothers such as that of Zebedee’s children, or
of Mark, or like St. John’s “elect lady,” or as Lois and Eunice, must
have kept the moral atmosphere pure and sweet, and shed precious light
on their homes and on society, corrupt to the core as it was under the
sway of heathenism. What and how they taught their households, and that
even under the most disadvantageous outward circumstances, we learn from
the history of Timothy. And although they were undoubtedly in that
respect without many of the opportunities which we enjoy, there was one
sweet practice of family religion, going beyond the prescribed prayers,
which enabled them to teach their children from tenderest years to
intertwine the Word of God with their daily devotion and daily life.

For it was the custom to teach a child some verse of Holy Scripture
beginning or ending with precisely the same letters as its Hebrew name,
and this birthday text or guardian-promise the child was day by day to
insert in its prayers. Such guardian words, familiar to the mind from
earliest years, endeared to the heart by tenderest recollections, would
remain with the youth in life’s temptations, and come back amid the din
of manhood’s battle. Assuredly, of Jewish children so reared, so
trained, so taught, it might be rightly said: “Take heed that ye despise
not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their
angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.”

Chapter 10. In Death and After Death
====================================

A sadder picture could scarcely be drawn than that of the dying Rabbi
Jochanan ben Saccai, that “light of Israel” immediately before and after
the destruction of the Temple, and for two years the president of the
Sanhedrim. We read in the Talmud (Ber. 28 b) that, when his disciples
came to see him on his death-bed, he burst into tears. To their
astonished inquiry why he, “the light of Israel, the right pillar of the
Temple, and its mighty hammer,” betrayed such signs of fear, he replied:
“If I were now to be brought before an earthly king, who lives to-day
and dies to-morrow, whose wrath and whose bonds are not everlasting, and
whose sentence of death, even, is not that to everlasting death, who can
be assuaged by arguments, or perhaps bought off by money–I should
tremble and weep; how much more reason have I for it, when about to be
led before the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, Who liveth
and abideth for ever, Whose chains are chains for evermore, and Whose
sentence of death killeth for ever, Whom I cannot assuage with words,
nor bribe by money! And not only so, but there are before me two ways,
one to paradise and the other to hell, and I know not which of the two
ways I shall have to go–whether to paradise or to hell: how, then, shall
I not shed tears?”

Side by side with this we may place the opposite saying of R. Jehudah,
called the Holy, who, when he died, lifted up both his hands to heaven,
protesting that none of those ten fingers had broken the law of God! It
were difficult to say which of these two is more contrary to the light
and liberty of the Gospel–the utter hopelessness of the one, or the
apparent presumption of the other.

And yet these sayings also recall to us something in the Gospel. For
there also we read of two ways–the one to paradise, the other to
destruction, and of fearing not those who can kill the body, but rather
Him who, after He hath killed the body, hath power to cast into hell.
Nor, on the other hand, was the assurance of St. Stephen, of St. James,
or of St. Paul, less confident than that of Jehudah, called the Holy,
though it expressed itself in a far different manner and rested on quite
other grounds. Never are the voices of the Rabbis more discordant, and
their utterances more contradictory or unsatisfying than in view of the
great problems of humanity: sin, sickness, death, and the hereafter.
Most truly did St. Paul, taught at the feet of Gamaliel in all the
traditions and wisdom of the fathers, speak the inmost conviction of
every Christian Rabbinist, that it is only our Saviour Jesus Christ Who
“hath brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel” (2 Tim
1:10).

When the disciples asked our Lord, in regard to the “man which was blind
from his birth”: “master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he
was born blind?” (John 9:1,2) we vividly realise that we hear a strictly
Jewish question. It was just such as was likely to be raised, and it
exactly expressed Jewish belief. That children benefited or suffered
according to the spiritual state of their parents was a doctrine current
among the Jews. But they also held that an unborn child might contract
guilt, since the Yezer ha-ra, or evil disposition which was present from
its earliest formation, might even then be called into activity by
outward circumstances. And sickness was regarded as alike the punishment
for sin and its atonement.

But we also meet with statements which remind us of the teaching of
Hebrews 12:5, 9. In fact, the apostolic quotation from Proverbs 3 is
made for exactly the same purpose in the Talmud (Ber. 5 a), in how
different a spirit will appear from the following summary. It appears
that two of the Rabbis had disagreed as to what were “the chastisements
of love,” the one maintaining, on the ground of Psalm 94:12, that they
were such as did not prevent a man from study, the other inferring from
Psalm 66:20 that they were such as did not hinder prayer. Superior
authority decided that both kinds were “chastisements of love,” at the
same time answering the quotation from Psalm 94 by proposing to read,
not “teachest him,” but “teachest us out of Thy law.”

But that the law teaches us that chastisements are of great advantage
might be inferred as follows: If, according to Exodus 21:26, 27, a slave
obtained freedom through the chastisement of his master–a chastisement
which affected only one of his members–how much more must those
chastisements effect which purified the whole body of man? Moreover, as
another Rabbi reminds us, the “covenant” is mentioned in connection with
salt (Lev 2:13), and also in connection with chastisements (Deu 28:58).
“As is the covenant,” spoken of in connection with salt, which gives
taste to the meat, so also is “the covenant” spoken of in connection
with chastisements, which purge away all the sins of a man. Indeed, as a
third Rabbi says: “Three good gifts hath the Holy One–blessed be
He!–given to Israel, and each of them only through sufferings–the law,
the land of Israel, and the world to come.” The law, according to Psalm
94:12; the land, according to Deuteronomy 8:5, which is immediately
followed by verse 7; and the world to come, according to Proverbs 6:23.

As on most other subjects, the Rabbis were accurate and keen observers
of the laws of health, and their regulations are often far in advance of
modern practice. From many allusions in the Old Testament we infer that
the science of medicine, which was carried to comparatively great
perfection in Egypt, where every disease had its own physician, was also
cultivated in Israel. Thus the sin of Asia, in trusting too much to
earthly physicians, is specially reproved (2 Chron 16:12). In New
Testament times we read of the woman who had spent all her substance,
and suffered so much at the hands of physicians (Mark 5:26); while the
use of certain remedies, such as oil and wine, in the treatment of
wounds (Luke 10:34), seems to have been popularly known.

St. Luke was a “physician” (Col 4:14); and among the regular Temple
officials there was a medical man, whose duty it was to attend to the
priesthood who, from ministering barefoot, must have been specially
liable to certain diseases. The Rabbis ordained that every town must
have at least one physician, who was also to be qualified to practise
surgery, or else a physician and a surgeon. Some of the Rabbis
themselves engaged in medical pursuits: and, in theory at least, every
practitioner ought to have had their licence. To employ a heretic or a
Hebrew Christian was specially prohibited, though a heathen might, if
needful, be called in. But, despite their patronage of the science,
caustic sayings also occur. “Physician, heal thyself,” is really a
Jewish proverb; “Live not in a city whose chief is a medical man”–he
will attend to public business and neglect his patients; “The best among
doctors deserves Gehenna”–for his bad treatment of some, and for his
neglect of others.

It were invidious to enter into a discussion of the remedies prescribed
in those times, although, to judge from what is advised in such cases,
we can scarcely wonder that the poor woman in the gospel was nowise
benefited, but rather the worse of them (Mark 5:26). The means
recommended were either generally hygienic–and in this respect the
Hebrews contrast favourably even with ourselves–or purely medicinal, or
else sympathetic, or even magical. The prescriptions consisted of
simples or of compounds, vegetables being far more used than minerals.
Cold-water compresses, the external and internal use of oil and of wine,
baths (medicated and other), and a certain diet, were carefully
indicated in special diseases. Goats’-milk and barley-porridge were
recommended in all diseases attended by wasting. Jewish surgeons seem
even to have known how to operate for cataract.

Ordinarily, life was expected to be protracted, and death regarded as
alike the punishment and the expiation of sin. To die within fifty years
of age was to be cut off; within fifty-two, to die the death of Samuel
the prophet; at sixty years of age, it was regarded as death at the
hands of Heaven; at seventy, as that of an old man; and at eighty, as
that of strength. Premature death was likened to the falling off of
unripe fruit, or the extinction of a candle. To depart without having a
son was to die, otherwise it was to fall asleep. The latter was stated
to have been the case with David; the former with Joab. If a person had
finished his work, his was regarded as the death of the righteous, who
is gathered to his fathers.

Tradition (Ber. 8 a) inferred, by a peculiar Rabbinical mode of
exegesis, from a word in Psalm 62:12, that there were 903 different
kinds of dying. The worst of these was angina, which was compared to
tearing out a thread from a piece of wool; while the sweetest and
gentlest, which was compared to drawing a hair out of milk, was called
“death by a kiss.” The latter designation originated from Numbers 33:38
and Deuteronomy 34:5, in which Aaron and Moses are respectively said to
have died “according to the word”–literally, “by the mouth of Jehovah.”
Over six persons, it was said, the angel of death had had no power–viz.,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they had seen their work quite
completed; and over Miriam, Aaron, and Moses, who had died by “the kiss
of God.” If premature death was the punishment of sin, the righteous
died because others were to enter on their work–Joshua on that of Moses,
Solomon on that of David, etc. But, when the time for death came,
anything might serve for its infliction, or, to put it in Rabbinical
language, “O Lord, all these are Thy servants”; for “whither a man was
to go, thither his feet would carry him.”

Certain signs were also noted as to the time and manner of dying. Sudden
death was called “being swallowed up,” death after one day’s illness,
that of rejection; after two days’, that of despair; after four days’,
that of reproof; after five days’, a natural death. Similarly, the
posture of the dying was carefully marked. To die with a happy smile, or
at least with a bright countenance, or looking upward, was a good omen;
to look downward, to seem disturbed, to weep, or even to turn to the
wall, were evil signs.

On recovering from illness, it was enjoined to return special thanks. It
was a curious superstition (Ber. 55 b), that, if any one announced his
illness on the first day of its occurrence, it might tend to make him
worse, and that only on the second day should prayers be offered for
him. Lastly, we may mention in this connection, as possibly throwing
light on the practice referred to by St. James (James 5:14), that it was
the custom to anoint the sick with a mixture of oil, wine, and water,
the preparation of which was even allowed on the Sabbath (Jer. Ber. ii.
2).

When our Lord mentioned visitation of the sick among the evidences of
that religion which would stand the test of the judgment day (Matt
25:36), He appealed to a principle universally acknowledged among the
Jews. The great Jewish doctor Maimonides holds that this duty takes
precedence of all other good works, and the Talmud goes even so far as
to assert, that whoever visits the sick shall deliver his soul from
Gehenna (Ned. 40- a). Accordingly, a Rabbi, discussing the meaning of
the expression, “Ye shall walk after the Lord your God” (Deu 13:4),
arrives at the conclusion, that it refers to the imitation of what we
read in Scripture of His doings. Thus God clothed the naked (Gen 3:21),
and so should we; He visited the sick (Gen 18:1); He comforted the
mourners, (Gen 25:11); and He buried the dead (Deu 35:6); leaving us in
all this an ensample that we should follow in His footsteps (Sota 14 a).

It was possibly to encourage to this duty, or else in reference to the
good effects of sympathy upon the sick, that we are told, that whoever
visits the sick takes away a sixtieth part of his sufferings (Ned. 39
b). Nor was the service of love to stop here; for, as we have seen, the
burial of the dead was quite as urgent a duty as the visitation of the
sick. As the funeral procession passed, every one was expected, if
possible, to join the convoy. The Rabbis applied to the observance of
this direction Proverbs 14:32, and 19:17; and to its neglect Proverbs
17:5 (Ber. 18 a). Similarly, all reverence was shown towards the remains
of the dead, and burying-places were kept free from every kind of
profanation, and even from light conversation.

Burial followed generally as soon as possible after death (Matt 9:23;
Acts 5:6,10, 8:2), no doubt partly on sanitary grounds. For special
reasons, however (Acts 9:37,39), or in the case of parents, there might
be a delay even of days. The preparations for the burial of our Lord,
mentioned in the gospels–the ointment against His burial (Matt 26:12),
the spices and ointments (Luke 23:56), the mixture of myrrh and
aloes–find their literal confirmation in what the Rabbis tell us of the
customs of the period (Ber. 53 a).

At one time the wasteful expenditure connected with funerals was so
great as to involve in serious difficulties the poor, who would not be
outdone by their neighbours. The folly extended not only to the funeral
rites, the burning of spices at the grave, and the depositing of money
and valuables in the tomb, but even to luxury in the wrappings of the
dead body. At last a much-needed reform was introduced by Rabbi
Gamaliel, who left directions that he was to be buried in simple linen
garments. In recognition of this a cup is to this day emptied to his
memory at funeral meals. His grandson limited even the number of
graveclothes to one dress.

The burial-dress is made of the most inexpensive linen, and bears the
name of (Tachrichin) “wrappings,” or else the “travelling-dress.” At
present it is always white, but formerly any other colour might be
chosen, of which we have some curious instances. Thus one Rabbi would
not be buried in white, lest he might seem like one glad, nor yet in
black, so as not to appear to sorrow, but in red; while another ordered
a white dress, to show that he was not ashamed of his works; and yet a
third directed that he should have his shoes and stockings, and a stick,
to be ready for the resurrection! As we know from the gospel, the body
was wrapped in “linen clothes,” and the face bound about with a napkin
(John 11:44, 20:5,7).

The body having been properly prepared, the funeral rites proceeded, as
described in the gospels. From the account of the funeral procession at
Nain, which the Lord of life arrested (Luke 7:11-15), many interesting
details may be learned. First, burying-places were always outside cities
(Matt 8:28, 27:7,52,53; John 11:30,31). Neither watercourses nor public
roads were allowed to pass through them, nor sheep to graze there.

We read of public and private burying-places–the latter chiefly in
gardens and caves. It was the practice to visit the graves (John 11:31)
partly to mourn and partly to pray. It was unlawful to eat or drink, to
read, or even to walk irreverently among them. Cremation was denounced
as a purely heathen practice, contrary to the whole spirit of Old
Testament teaching. Secondly, we know that, as at Nain, the body was
generally carried open on a bier, or else in an open coffin, the bearers
frequently changing to give an opportunity to many to take part in a
work deemed so meritorious. Graves in fields or in the open were often
marked by memorial columns. Children less than a month old were carried
to the burying by their mothers; those under twelve months were borne on
a bed or stretcher.

Lastly, the order in which the procession seems to have wound out of
Nain exactly accords with what we know of the customs of the time and
place. It was outside the city gate that the Lord with His disciples met
the sad array. Had it been in Judaea the hired mourners and musicians
would have preceded the bier; in Galilee they followed. First came the
women, for, as an ancient Jewish commentary explains–woman, who brought
death into our world, ought to lead the way in the funeral procession.

Among them our Lord readily recognised the widowed mother, whose only
treasure was to be hidden from her for ever. Behind the bier followed,
obedient to Jewish law and custom, “much people of the city.” The sight
of her sorrow touched the compassion of the Son of Man; the presence of
death called forth the power of the Son of God. To her only He spoke,
what in the form of a question He said to the woman who mourned at His
own grave, ignorant that death had been swallowed up in victory, and
what He still speaks to us from heaven, “Weep not!” He bade not the
procession halt, but, as He touched the bier, they that bore on it the
dead body stood still. It was a marvellous sight outside the gate of
Nain.

The Rabbi and His disciples should reverently have joined the
procession; they arrested it. One word of power burst inwards the
sluices of Hades, and out flowed once again the tide of life. “He that
was dead sat up on his bier, and began to speak”–what words of
wonderment we are not told. It must have been like the sudden wakening,
which leaves not on the consciousness the faintest trace of the dream.
Not of that world but of this would his speech be, though he knew he had
been over there, and its dazzling light made earth’s sunshine so dim,
that ever afterwards life must have seemed to him like the sitting up on
his bier, and its faces and voices like those of the crowd which
followed him to his burying.

At the grave, on the road to which the procession repeatedly halted,
when short addresses were occasionally delivered, there was a funeral
oration. If the grave were in a public cemetery, at least a foot and a
half must intervene between each sleeper. The caves, or rock-hewn
sepulchres, consisted of an ante-chamber in which the bier was
deposited, and an inner or rather lower cave in which the bodies were
deposited, in a recumbent position, in niches. According to the Talmud
these abodes of the dead were usually six feet long, nine feet wide, and
ten feet high. Here there were niches for eight bodies: three on each
side of the entrance, and two opposite. Larger sepulchres held thirteen
bodies.

The entrance to the sepulchres was guarded by a large stone or by a door
(Matt 27:66; Mark 15:46; John 11:38,39). This structure of the tombs
will explain some of the particulars connected with the burial of our
Lord, how the women coming early to the grave had been astonished in
finding the “very great stone” “rolled away from the door of the
sepulchre,” and then, when they entered the outer cave, were affrighted
to see what seemed “a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a
long white garment” (Mark 16:4,5). Similarly, it explains the events as
they are successively recorded in John 20:1-12, how Mary Magdalene,
“when it was yet dark,” had come to the sepulchre, in every sense
waiting for the light, but even groping had felt that the stone was
rolled away, and fled to tell the disciples they had, as she thought,
taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre.

If she knew of the sealing of that stone and of the Roman guard, she
must have felt as if the hatred of man would not deprive their love even
of the sacred body of their Lord. And yet, through it all, the hearts of
the disciples must have treasured hopes, which they scarce dared confess
to themselves. For those other two disciples, witnesses of all His deeds
on earth, companions of His shame in Caiaphas’ palace, were also waiting
for the daybreak–only at home, not like her at the grave. And now “they
both ran together.” But on that morning, so near the night of betrayal,
“the other disciple did outrun Peter.” Grey light of early spring had
broken the heavy curtain of cloud and mist, and red and golden sunlight
lay on the edge of the horizon.

The garden was still, and the morning air stirred the trees which in the
dark night had seemed to keep watch over the dead, as through the
unguarded entrance, by which lay “the very great stone” rolled away,
John passed, and “stooping down” into the inner cave “saw the linen
clothes lying.” “Then cometh Simon Peter,” not to wait in the outer
cave, but to go into the sepulchre, presently to be followed thither by
John. For that empty sepulchre was not a place to look into, but to go
into and believe. That morn had witnessed many wonders–wonders which
made the Magdalene long for yet greater–for the wonder of wonders, the
Lord Himself. Nor was she disappointed. He Who alone could answer her
questions fully, and dry her tears, spake first to her who loved so
much.

Thus also did our blessed Lord Himself fulfil most truly that on which
the law and Jewish tradition laid so great stress: to comfort the
mourners in their affliction (comp. James 1:27). Indeed, tradition has
it, that there was in the Temple a special gate by which mourners
entered, that all who met them might discharge this duty of love.

There was a custom, which deserves general imitation, that mourners were
not to be tormented by talk, but that all should observe silence till
addressed by them. Afterwards, to obviate foolish remarks, a formula was
fixed, according to which, in the synagogue the leader of the devotions,
and in the house some one, began by asking, “Inquire for the ground of
mourning”; upon which one of those present–if possible, a
Rabbi–answered, “God is a just Judge,” which meant, that He had removed
a near relative. Then, in the synagogue, a regular fixed formula of
comfort was spoken, while in the house kind expressions of consolation
followed.

The Rabbis distinguish between the Onen and the Avel–the sorrowing or
suffering one, and the bowed down, fading one, or mourner; the former
expression applying only to the day of the funeral, the latter to the
period which followed. It was held, that the law of God only prescribed
mourning for the first day, which was that of death and burial (Lev
22:4,6), while the other and longer period of mourning that followed was
enjoined by the elders. So long as the dead body was actually in the
house, it was forbidden to eat meat or drink wine, to put on the
phylacteries, or to engage in study.

All necessary food had to be prepared outside the house, and as, if
possible, not to be eaten in presence of the dead. The first duty was to
rend the clothes, which might be done in one or more of the inner
garments, but not in the outer dress. The rent is made standing, and in
front; it is generally about a hand-breadth in length. In the case of
parents it is never closed up again; but in that of others it is mended
after the thirtieth day. Immediately after the body is carried out of
the house all chairs and couches are reversed, and the mourners sit
(except on the Sabbath, and on the Friday only for one hour) on the
ground or on a low stool. A three-fold distinction was here made. Deep
mourning was to last for seven days, of which the first three were those
of “weeping.”

During these seven days it was, among other things, forbidden to wash,
to anoint oneself, to put on shoes, to study, or to engage in any
business. After that followed a lighter mourning of thirty days.
Children were to mourn for their parents a whole year; and during eleven
months (so as not to imply that they required to remain a full year in
purgatory) to say the “prayer for the dead.” The latter, however, does
not contain any intercession for the departed. The anniversary of the
day of death was also to be observed. An apostate from the Jewish faith
was not to be mourned; on the contrary, white dress was to be worn on
the occasion of his decease, and other demonstrations of joy to be made.
It is well known under what exceptional circumstances priests and the
high-priest were allowed to mourn for the dead (Lev 21:10,11). In the
case of the high-priest it was customary to say to him, “May we be thy
expiation!” (“Let us suffer what ought to have befallen thee”;) to which
he replied, “Be ye blessed of Heaven” (Sanh. ii. 1).

It is noted that this mode of address to the high-priest was intended to
indicate the greatness of their affection; and the learned Otho suggests
(Lexic. Rabb, p. 343), that this may have been in the mind of the
apostle when he would have wished himself Anathema for the sake of his
brethren (Rom 9:3). On the return from the burial, friends, or
neighbours prepared a meal for the mourners, consisting of bread,
hard-boiled eggs, and lentils–round and coarse fare; round like life,
which is rolling on unto death. This was brought in and served up in
earthenware. On the other hand, the mourners’ friends partook of a
funeral meal, at which no more than ten cups were to be emptied–two
before the meal, five at it, and three afterwards (Jer. Ber. iii. 1). In
modern times the religious duty of attending to the dying, the dead, and
mourners, is performed by a special “holy brotherhood,” as it is called,
which many of the most religious Jews join for the sake of the pious
work in which it engages them.

We add the following, which may be of interest. It is expressly allowed
(Jer. Ber. iii. 1), on Sabbaths and feast-days to walk beyond the
Sabbath limits, and to do all needful offices for the dead. This throws
considerable light on the evangelical account of the offices rendered to
the body of Jesus on the eve of the Passover. The chief mourning rites,
indeed, were intermitted on Sabbaths and feast-days; and one of the most
interesting, and perhaps the earliest Hebrew non-Biblical record–the
Megillath Taanith, or roll of fasts–mentions a number of other days on
which mourning was prohibited, being the anniversaries of joyous
occasions. The Mishnah (Moed K. iii. 5-9) contains a number of
regulations and limitations of mourning observances on greater and
lesser feasts, which we do not quote, as possessing little interest save
in Rabbinical casuistry. The loss of slaves was not to be mourned.

But what after death and in the judgment? And what of that which brought
in, and which gives such terrible meaning to death and the judgment–sin?
It were idle, and could only be painful here to detail the various and
discordant sayings of the Rabbis, some of which, at least, may admit of
an allegorical interpretation. Only that which may be of use to the New
Testament student shall be briefly summarised. Both the Talmud (Pes. 54
a; Ned. 39 b), and the Targum teach that paradise and hell were created
before this world. One quotation from the Jerusalem Targum (on Gen 3:24)
will not only sufficiently prove this, but show the general current of
Jewish teaching.

Two thousand years, we read, before the world was made, God created the
Law and Gehenna, and the Garden of Eden. He made the Garden of Eden for
the righteous, that they might eat of the fruits thereof, and delight
themselves in them, because in this world they had kept the commandments
of the law. But for the wicked He prepared Gehenna, which is like a
sharp two-edged destroying sword. He put within it sparks of fire and
burning coals, to punish the wicked in the world to come, because they
had not observed the commandments of the law in this world. For the law
is the tree of life. Whosoever observeth it shall live and subsist as
the tree of life. <sup>**[<sup>48</sup>](#sdfootnote48sym)**</sup>

Paradise and hell were supposed to be contiguous, only separated–it was
said, perhaps allegorically–by an handbreadth. But although we may here
find some slight resemblance to the localisation of the history of the
rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:25,26), only those acquainted with the
theological thinking of the time can fully judge what infinite
difference there is between the story in the Gospel and the pictures
drawn in contemporary literature. Witness here the 22nd chapter of the
book of Enoch, which, as so many other passages from pseudo-epigraphic
and Rabbinical writings, has been mangled and misquoted by modern
writers, for purposes hostile to Christianity.

The Rabbis seem to have believed in a multitude of heavens–most of them
holding that there were seven, as there were also seven departments in
paradise, and as many in hell. The pre-existence of the souls of all
mankind before their actual appearance upon earth, and even the doctrine
of the migration of souls, seem also to have been held–both probably,
however, chiefly as speculative views, introduced from foreign,
non-Judaean sources.

But all these are preliminary and outside questions, which only
indirectly touch the great problems of the human soul concerning sin and
salvation. And here we can, in this place, only state that the deeper
and stronger our conviction that the language, surroundings, and whole
atmosphere of the New Testament were those of Palestine at the time when
our Lord trod its soil, the more startling appears the contrast between
the doctrinal teaching of Christ and His apostles and that of the
Rabbis. In general, it may be said that the New Testament teaching
concerning original sin and its consequences finds no analogy in the
Rabbinical writings of that period. As to the mode of salvation, their
doctrine may be broadly summed up under the designation of
work-righteousness.

In view of this there is, strictly speaking, logical inconsistency in
the earnestness with which the Rabbis insist on universal and immediate
repentance, and the need of confession of sin, and of preparation for
another world. For, a paradise which might be entered by all on their
own merits, and which yet is to be sought by all through repentance and
similar means, or else can only be obtained after passing through a kind
of purgatory, constitutes no mean moral charge against the religion of
Rabbinism. Yet such inconsistencies may be hailed as bringing the
synagogue, in another direction, nearer to biblical truth. Indeed, we
come occasionally upon much that also appears, only in quite another
setting, in the New Testament.

Thus the teaching of our Lord about the immortality of the righteous
was, of course, quite consonant with that of the Pharisees. In fact,
their contention also was, that the departed saints were in Scripture
called “living” (Ber. 18 a). Similarly, it was their doctrine (Ber. 17
a, and in several other passages)–though not quite consistently held–as
it was that of our Lord (Matt 22:30), that “in the world to come there
is neither eating nor drinking, neither fruitfulness nor increase,
neither trade nor business, neither envy, hatred, nor strife; but the
righteous sit with their crowns on their heads, and feast themselves on
the splendour of the Shechinah, as it is written, ‘They saw God, and did
eat and drink’” (Exo 24:11).

The following is so similar in form and yet so different in spirit to
the parable of the invited guests and him without the wedding garment
(Matt 22:1-14), that we give it in full. "R. Jochanan, son of Saccai,
propounded a parable. A certain king prepared a banquet, to which he
invited his servants, without however having fixed the time for it.
Those among them who were wise adorned themselves, and sat down at the
door of the king’s palace, reasoning thus: Can there be anything
awanting in the palace of a king? But those of them who were foolish
went away to their work, saying: Is there ever a feast without labour?
Suddenly the king called his servants to the banquet.

The wise appeared adorned, but the foolish squalid. Then the king
rejoiced over the wise, but was very wroth with the foolish, and said:
Those who have adorned themselves shall sit down, eat, drink, and be
merry; but those who have not adorned themselves shall stand by and see
it, as it is written in Isaiah 65:13." A somewhat similar parable, but
even more Jewish in its dogmatic cast, is the following: "The matter (of
the world to come) is like an earthly king who committed to his servants
the royal robes.

They who were wise folded and laid them up in the wardrobes, but they
who were careless put them on, and did in them their work. After some
days the king asked back his robes. Those who were wise restored them as
they were, that is, still clean; those who were foolish also restored
them as they were, that is, soiled. Then the king rejoiced over the
wise, but was very wroth with the careless servants, and he said to the
wise: Lay up the robes in the treasury, and go home in peace.

But to the careless he commanded the robes to be given, that they might
wash them, and that they themselves should be cast into prison, as it is
written of the bodies of the just in Isaiah 57:2; 1 Samuel 25:29, but of
the bodies of the unjust in Isaiah 48:22, 57:21 and in 1 Samuel 25:29."
From the same tractate (Shab. 152 a), we may, in conclusion, quote the
following: “R. Eliezer said, Repent on the day before thou diest. His
disciples asked him: Can a man know the hour of his death? He replied:
Therefore let him repent to-day, lest haply he die on the morrow.”

Quotations on these, and discussions on kindred subjects might lead us
far beyond our present scope. But the second of the parables above
quoted will point the direction of the final conclusions at which
Rabbinism arrived. It is not, as in the Gospel, pardon and peace, but
labour with the “may be” of reward. As for the “after death,” paradise,
hell, the resurrection, and the judgment, voices are more discordant
than ever, opinions more unscriptural, and descriptions more repulsively
fabulous. This is not the place farther to trace the doctrinal views of
the Rabbis, to attempt to arrange and to follow them up.
Work-righteousness and study of the law are the surest key to heaven.

There is a kind of purgation, if not of purgatory, after death. Some
seem even to have held the annihilation of the wicked. Taking the widest
and most generous views of the Rabbis, they may be thus summed up: All
Israel have share in the world to come; the pious among the Gentiles
also have part in it. Only the perfectly just enter at once into
paradise; all the rest pass through a period of purification and
perfection, variously lasting, up to one year. But notorious breakers of
the law, and especially apostates from the Jewish faith, and heretics,
have no hope whatever, either here or hereafter! Such is the last word
which the synagogue has to say to mankind.

Not thus are we taught by the Messiah, the King of the Jews. If we learn
our loss, we also learn that “The Son of Man has come to seek and to
save that which was lost.” Our righteousness is that freely bestowed on
us by Him “Who was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our
iniquities.” “With His stripes we are healed.” The law which we obey is
that which He has put within our hearts, by which we become temples of
the Holy Ghost. “The Dayspring from on high hath visited us” through the
tender mercy of our God.

The Gospel hath brought life and immortality to light, for we know Whom
we have believed; and “perfect love casteth out fear.” Not even the
problems of sickness, sorrow, suffering, and death are unnoticed.
“Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.” The
tears of earth’s night hang as dewdrops on flower and tree, presently to
sparkle like diamonds in the morning sun. For, in that night of nights
has Christ mingled the sweat of human toil and sorrow with the precious
blood of His agony, and made it drop on earth as sweet balsam to heal
its wounds, to soothe its sorrows, and to take away its death.

Chapter 11. Jewish Views on Trade, Tradesmen, and Trade Guilds
==============================================================

We read in the Mishnah (Kidd. iv. 14) as follows: "Rabbi Meir said: Let
a man always teach his son a cleanly and a light trade; and let him pray
to Him whose are wealth and riches; for there is no trade which has not
both poverty and riches, and neither does poverty come from the trade
nor yet riches, but everything according to one’s deserving (merit).
Rabbi Simeon, the son of Eleazer, said: Hast thou all thy life long seen
a beast or a bird which has a trade? Still they are nourished, and that
without anxious care. And if they, who are created only to serve me,
shall not I expect to be nourished without anxious care, who am created
to serve my Maker? Only that if I have been evil in my deeds, I forfeit
my support. Abba Gurjan of Zadjan said, in name of Abba Gurja: Let not a
man bring up his son to be a donkey-driver, nor a camel-driver, nor a
barber, nor a sailor, nor a shepherd, nor a pedlar; for their
occupations are those of thieves.

In his name, Rabbi Jehudah said: Donkey-drivers are mostly wicked;
camel-drivers mostly honest; sailors mostly pious; the best among
physicians is for Gehenna, and the most honest of butchers a companion
of Amalek. Rabbi Nehorai said: I let alone every trade of this world,
and teach my son nothing but the Thorah (the law of God); for a man eats
of the fruit of it in this world (as it were, lives upon earth on the
interest), while the capital remaineth for the world to come. But what
is left over (what remains) in every trade (or worldly employment) is
not so. For, if a man fall into ill-health, or come to old age or into
trouble (chastisement), and is no longer able to stick to his work, lo!
he dies of hunger.

But the Torah is not so, for it keeps a man from evil in youth, and in
old age gives him both a hereafter and the hopeful waiting for it. What
does it say about youth? ‘They that wait upon the Lord shall renew
strength.’ And what about old age? ‘They shall still bring forth fruit
in old age.’ And this is what is said of Abraham our father: ‘And
Abraham was old, and Jehovah blessed Abraham in all things.’ But we find
that Abraham our father kept the whole Torah–the whole, even to that
which had not yet been given–as it is said, ‘Because that Abraham obeyed
My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My
laws.’"

If this quotation has been long, it will in many respects prove
instructive; for it not only affords a favourable specimen of Mishnic
teaching, but gives insight into the principles, the reasoning, and the
views of the Rabbis. At the outset, the saying of Rabbi Simeon–which,
however, we should remember, was spoken nearly a century after the time
when our Lord had been upon earth–reminds us of His own words (Matt
6:26): “Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they
reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are
ye not much better than they?”

It would be a delightful thought, that our Lord had thus availed Himself
of the better thinking and higher feeling in Israel; so to speak,
polished the diamond and made it sparkle, as He held it up in the light
of the kingdom of God. For here also it holds true, that the Saviour
came not in any sense to “destroy,” but to “establish the law.” All
around the scene of His earthly ministry the atmosphere was Jewish; and
all that was pure, true, and good in the nation’s life, teaching, and
sayings He made His own. On every page of the gospels we come upon what
seems to waken the echoes of Jewish voices; sayings which remind us of
what we have heard among the sages of Israel.

And this is just what we should have expected, and what gives no small
confirmation of the trustworthiness of these narratives as the record of
what had really taken place. It is not a strange scene upon which we are
here introduced; nor among strange actors; nor are the surroundings
foreign. Throughout we have a life-picture of the period, in which we
recognise the speakers from the sketches of them drawn elsewhere, and
whose mode of speaking we know from contemporary literature. The gospels
could not have set aside, they could not even have left out, the Jewish
element. Otherwise they would not have been true to the period, nor to
the people, nor to the writers, nor yet to that law of growth and
development which always marks the progress of the kingdom of God. In
one respect only all is different. The gospels are most Jewish in form,
but most anti-Jewish in spirit–the record of the manifestation among
Israel of the Son of God, the Saviour of the world, as the “King of the
Jews.”

This influence of the Jewish surroundings upon the circumstances of the
gospel history has a most important bearing. It helps us to realise what
Jewish life had been at the time of Christ, and to comprehend what might
seem peculiarities in the gospel narrative. Thus–to come to the subject
of this chapter–we now understand how so many of the disciples and
followers of the Lord gained their living by some craft; how in the same
spirit the Master Himself condescended to the trade of His adoptive
father; and how the greatest of His apostles throughout earned his bread
by the labour of his hands, probably following, like the Lord Jesus, the
trade of his father.

For it was a principle, frequently expressed, if possible “not to
forsake the trade of the father”–most likely not merely from worldly
considerations, but because it might be learned in the house; perhaps
even from considerations of respect for parents. And what in this
respect Paul practised, that he also preached. Nowhere is the dignity of
labour and the manly independence of honest work more clearly set forth
than in his Epistles. At Corinth, his first search seems to have been
for work (Acts 18:3); and through life he steadily forbore availing
himself of his right to be supported by the Church, deeming it his great
“reward” to “make the Gospel of Christ without charge” (1 Cor 9:18).
Nay, to quote his impassioned language, he would far rather have died of
hard work than that any man should deprive him of this “glorying.”

And so presently at Ephesus “these hands” minister not only unto his own
necessities, but also to them that were with him; and that for the
twofold reason of supporting the weak, and of following the Master,
however “afar off,” and entering into this joy of His, “It is more
blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:34,35). Again, so to speak, it
does one’s heart good when coming in contact with that Church which
seemed most in danger of dreamy contemplativeness, and of unpractical,
of not dangerous, speculations about the future, to hear what a manly,
earnest tone also prevailed there.

Here is the preacher himself! Not a man-pleaser, but a God-server; not a
flatterer, nor covetous, nor yet seeking glory, nor courting authority,
like the Rabbis. What then? This is the sketch as drawn from life at
Thessalonica, so that each who had known him must have recognised it:
most loving, like a nursing mother, who cherisheth her own children, so
in tenderness willing to impart not only the Gospel of God, but his own
life. Yet, with it all, no mawkishness, no sentimentality; but all
stern, genuine reality; and the preacher himself is “labouring night and
day,” because he would not be chargeable to any of them, while he
preached unto them the gospel of God (1 Thess 2:9). “Night and day,”
hard, unremitting, uninteresting work, which some would have denounced
or despised as secular!

But to Paul that wretched distinction, the invention of modern
superficialism and unreality, existed not. For to the spiritual nothing
is secular, and to the secular nothing is spiritual. Work night and day,
and then as his rest, joy, and reward, to preach in public and in
private the unsearchable riches of Christ, Who had redeemed him with His
precious blood. And so his preaching, although one of its main burdens
seems to have been the second coming of the Lord, was in no way
calculated to make the hearers apocalyptic dreamers, who discussed
knotty points and visions of the future, while present duty lay unheeded
as beneath them, on a lower platform.

There is a ring of honest independence, of healthy, manly piety, of
genuine, self-denying devotion to Christ, and also of a practical life
of holiness, in this admonition (1 Thess 4:11,12): “Make it your
ambition to be quite, to do your own” (each one for himself, not
meddling with others’ affairs), “and to work with your hands, as we
commanded you, that ye may walk decorously towards them without, and
have no need of any one” (be independent of all men). And, very
significantly, this plain, practical religion is placed in immediate
conjunction with the hope of the resurrection and of the coming again of
our Lord (vv 13-18).

The same admonition, “to work, and eat their own bread,” comes once
again, only in stronger language, in the Second Epistle to the
Thessalonians, reminding them in this of his own example, and of his
command when with them, “that, if any would not work, neither should he
eat”; at the same time sternly rebuking “some who are walking
disorderly, who are not at all busy, but are busybodies” (we have here
tried to reproduce the play on the words in the original).

Now, we certainly do not pretend to find a parallel to St. Paul among
even the best and the noblest of the Rabbis. Yet Saul of Tarsus was a
Jew, not merely trained at the feet of the great Gamaliel, “that sun in
Israel,” but deeply imbued with the Jewish spirit and lore; insomuch
that long afterwards, when he is writing of the deepest mysteries of
Christianity, we catch again and again expressions that remind us of
some that occur in the earliest record of that secret Jewish doctrine,
which was only communicated to the most select of the select sages.
<sup>**[<sup>49</sup>](#sdfootnote49sym)**</sup>

And this same love of honest labour, the same spirit of manly
independence, the same horror of trafficking with the law, and using it
either “as a crown or as a spade,” was certainly characteristic of the
best Rabbis. Quite different in this respect also–far asunder as were
the aims of their lives–were the feelings of Israel from those of the
Gentiles around. The philosophers of Greece and Rome denounced manual
labour as something degrading; indeed, as incompatible with the full
exercise of the privileges of a citizen.

Those Romans who allowed themselves not only to be bribed in their
votes, but expected to be actually supported at the public expense,
would not stoop to the defilement of work. The Jews had another aim in
life, another pride and ambition. It is difficult to give an idea of the
seeming contrasts united in them. Most aristocratic and exclusive,
contemptuous of mere popular cries, yet at the same time most democratic
and liberal; law-abiding, and with the profoundest reverence for
authority and rank, and yet with this prevailing conviction at bottom,
that all Israel were brethren, and as such stood on precisely the same
level, the eventual differences arising only from this, that the mass
failed to realise what Israel’s real vocation was, and how it was to be
attained, viz., by theoretical and practical engagement with the law,
compared to which everything else was but secondary and unimportant.

But this combination of study with honest manual labour–the one to
support the other–had not been always equally honoured in Israel. We
distinguish here three periods. The law of Moses evidently recognised
the dignity of labour, and this spirit of the Old Testament appeared in
the best times of the Jewish nation. The book of Proverbs, which
contains so many sketches of what a happy, holy home in Israel had been,
is full of the praises of domestic industry. But the Apocrypha, notably
Ecclesiasticus (xxxviii. 24-31), strike a very different key-note.
Analysing one by one every trade, the contemptuous question is put, how
such “can get wisdom?”

This “Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach” dates from about two centuries
before the present era. It would not have been possible at the time of
Christ or afterwards, to have written in such terms of “the carpenter
and workmaster,” of them “that cut and grave seals,” of “the smith,” or
“the potter”; nor to have said of them: “They shall not be sought for in
public counsel, nor sit high in the congregation; they shall not sit on
the judges’ seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment; they cannot
declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables
are spoken” (Ecclus xxxviii. 33).

For, in point of fact, with few exceptions, all the leading Rabbinical
authorities were working at some trade, till at last it became quite an
affectation to engage in hard bodily labour, so that one Rabbi would
carry his own chair every day to college, while others would drag heavy
rafters, or work in some such fashion. Without cumbering these pages
with names, it is worth mentioning, perhaps as an extreme instance, that
on one occasion a man was actually summoned from his trade of
stone-cutter to the high-priestly office. To be sure, that was in
revolutionary times. The high-priests under the Herodian dynasty were of
only too different a class, and their history possesses a tragic
interest, as bearing on the state and fate of the nation.

Still, the great Hillel was a wood-cutter, his rival Shammai a
carpenter,; and among the celebrated Rabbis of after times we find
shoemakers, tailors, carpenters, sandalmakers, smiths, potters,
builders, etc.–in short, every variety of trade. Nor were they ashamed
of their manual labour. Thus it is recorded of one of them, that he was
in the habit of discoursing to his students from the top of a cask of
his own making, which he carried every day to the academy.

We can scarcely wonder at this, since it was a Rabbinical principle,
that “whoever does not teach his son a trade is as if he brought him up
to be a robber” (Kidd. 4.14). The Midrash gives the following curious
paraphrase of Ecclesiastes 9:9, “Behold, the life with the wife whom
thou lovest” (so literally in the Hebrew): Look out for a trade along
with the Divine study which thou lovest. “How highly does the Maker of
the world value trades,” is another saying.

Here are some more: “There is none whose trade God does not adorn with
beauty.” “Though there were seven years of famine, it will never come to
the door of the tradesman.” “There is not a trade to which both poverty
and riches are not joined; for there is nothing more poor, and nothing
more rich, than a trade.” “No trade shall ever disappear from the world.
Happy he whom his teacher has brought up to a good trade; alas for him
who has been put into a bad one.” Perhaps these are comparatively later
Rabbinical sayings.

But let us turn to the Mishnah itself, and especially to that tractate
which professedly embodies the wisdom and the sayings of the fathers
(Aboth). Shemaajah, the teacher of Hillel, has this cynical saying (Ab.
i. 10)–perhaps the outcome of his experience: “Love work, hate
Rabbiship, and do not press on the notice of those in power.” The views
of the great Hillel himself have been quoted in a previous chapter.
Rabbi Gamaliel, the son of Jehudah the Nasi, said (Ab. ii. 2): “Fair is
the study of the law, if accompanied by worldly occupation: to engage in
them both is to keep away sin; while study which is not combined with
work must in the end be interrupted, and only brings sin with it.”

Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Asarjah, says, among other things: “Where
there is no worldly support (literally, no meal, no flour), there is no
study of the law; and where there is no study of the law, worldly
support is of no value” (Ab. iii. 21). It is worth while to add what
immediately follows in the Mishnah. Its resemblance to the simile about
the rock, and the building upon it, as employed by our Lord (Matt 7:24;
Luke 6:47), is so striking, that we quote it in illustration of previous
remarks on this subject.

We read as follows: “He whose knowledge exceeds his works, to whom is he
like? He is like a tree, whose branches are many and its roots few, and
the wind cometh, and uproots the tree and throws it upon its face, as it
is said (Jer 17:6)…But he whose works exceed his knowledge, to whom is
he like? To a tree whose branches are few, but its roots many; and if
even all the winds that are in the world came and set upon such a tree,
they would not move it from its place, as it is written (Jer 17:8).” We
have given this saying in its earliest form.

Even so, it should be remembered that it dates from after the
destruction of Jerusalem. It occurs in a still later form in the Babylon
Talmud (Sanh. 99 a). But what is most remarkable is, that it also
appears in yet another work, and in a form almost identical with that in
the New Testament, so far as the simile of the building is concerned. In
this form it is attributed to a Rabbi who is stigmatised as an apostate,
and as the type of apostasy, and who, as such, died under the ban. The
inference seems to be, that if he did not profess some form of
Christianity, he had at least derived this saying from his intercourse
with Christians. <sup>**[<sup>50</sup>](#sdfootnote50sym)**</sup>

But irrespective of this, two things are plain on comparison of the
saying in its Rabbinical and in its Christian form. First, in the
parable as employed by our Lord, everything is referred to Him; and the
essential difference ultimately depends upon our relationship towards
Him. The comparison here is not between much study and little work, or
little Talmudical knowledge and much work; but between coming to Him and
hearing these sayings of His, and then either doing or else not doing
them.

Secondly, such an alternative is never presented by Christianity as, on
the one hand, much knowledge and few works, and on the other, little
knowledge and many works. But in Christianity the vital difference lies
between works and no works; between absolute life and absolute death;
all depending upon this, whether a man has digged down to the right
foundation, and built upon the rock which is Christ, or has tried to
build up the walls of his life without such foundation. Thus the very
similarity of the saying in its Rabbinical form brings out all the more
clearly the essential difference and contrariety in spirit existing
between Rabbinism, even in its purest form, and the teaching of our
Lord.

The question of the relation between the best teaching of the Jewish
sages and some of the sayings of our Lord is of such vital importance,
that this digression will not seem out of place. A few further
quotations bearing on the dignity of labour may be appropriate. The
Talmud has a beautiful Haggadah, which tells how, when Adam heard this
sentence of his Maker: “Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to
thee,” he burst into tears, “What!” he exclaimed; “Lord of the world, am
I then to eat out of the same manger with the ass?”

But when he heard these additional words: “In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread,” his heart was comforted. For herein lies
(according to the Rabbis) the dignity of labour, that man is not forced
to, nor unconscious in, his work; but that while becoming the servant of
the soil, he wins from it the precious fruits of golden harvest. And so,
albeit labour may be hard, and the result doubtful, as when Israel stood
by the shores of the Red Sea, yet a miracle will cleave these waters
also. And still the dignity of labour is great in itself: it reflects
honour; it nourisheth and cherisheth him that engageth in it. For this
reason also did the law punish with fivefold restitution the theft of an
ox, but only with fourfold that of a sheep; because the former was that
with which a man worked.

Assuredly St. Paul spoke also as a Jew when he admonished the Ephesians
(Eph 4:28): “Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him
labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have
to give to him that needeth.” “Make a working day of the Sabbath: only
be not dependent upon people,” was the Rabbinical saying (Pes. 112).
“Skin dead animals by the wayside,” we read, “and take thy payment for
it, but do not say, I am a priest; I am a man of distinction, and work
is objectionable to me!”

And to this day the common Jewish proverb has it: “Labour is no cherpah
(disgrace)”; or again: “Melachah is berachah (Labour is blessing).” With
such views, we can understand how universal industrious pursuits were in
the days of our Lord. Although it is no doubt true, as the Rabbinical
proverb puts it, that every man thinks most of his own trade, yet public
opinion attached a very different value to different kinds of trade.
Some were avoided on account of the unpleasantnesses connected with
them, such as those of tanners, dyers, and miners. The Mishnah lays it
down as a principle, that a man should not teach his son a trade which
necessitates constant intercourse with the other sex (Kidd. iv. 14).

Such would include, among others jewellers, makers of handmills,
perfumers, and weavers. The latter trade seems to have exposed to as
many troubles as if the weavers of those days had been obliged to serve
a modern fashionable lady. The saying was: “A weaver must be humble, or
his life will be shortened by excommunication”; that is, he must submit
to anything for a living. Or, as the common proverb put it (Ab. S. 26
a): “If a weaver is not humble, his life is shortened by a year.”

This other saying, of a similar kind, reminds us of the Scotch estimate
of, or rather disrespect for, weavers: “Even a weaver is master in his
own house.” And this not only in his own opinion, but in that of his
wife also. For as the Rabbinical proverb has it: “Though a man were only
a comber of wool, his wife would call him up to the house-door, and sit
down beside him,” so proud is she of him. Perhaps in the view of the
Rabbis there was a little of female self-consciousness in this regard
for her husband’s credit, for they have it: “Though a man were only the
size of an ant, his wife would try to sit down among the big ones.”

In general, the following sound views are expressed in the Talmud (Ber.
17 a): “The Rabbi of Jabne said: I am simply a being like my neighbour.
He works in the field, and I in the town. We both rise early to go to
work; and there is no cause for the one setting himself up above the
other. Do not think that the one does more than the other; for we have
been taught that there is as much merit in doing that which is little as
that which is great, provided the state of our hearts be right.”

And so a story is told, how one who dug cisterns and made baths (for
purification) accosted the great Rabbi Jochanan with the words: “I am as
great a man as thou”; since, in his own sphere, he served the wants of
the community quite as much as the most learned teacher in Israel. In
the same spirit another Rabbi admonished to strict conscientiousness,
since in a sense all work, however humble, was really work for God.
There can be no doubt that the Jewish tradesman who worked in such a
spirit would be alike happy and skilful.

It must have been a great privilege to be engaged in any work connected
with the Temple. A large number of workmen were kept constantly employed
there, preparing what was necessary for the service. Perhaps it was only
a piece of Jerusalem jealousy of the Alexandrians which prompted such
Rabbinical traditions, as, that, when Alexandrians tried to compound the
incense for the Temple, the column of smoke did not ascend quite
straight; when they repaired the large mortar in which the incense was
bruised, and again, the great cymbal with which the signal for the
commencement of the Temple music was given, in each case their work had
to be undone by Jerusalem workmen, in order to produce a proper mixture,
or to evoke the former sweet sounds.

There can be no question, however, notwithstanding Palestinian
prejudices, that there were excellent Jewish workmen in Alexandria; and
plenty of them, too, as we know from their arrangement in guilds in
their great synagogue. Any poor workman had only to apply to his guild,
and he was supported till he found employment. The guild of coppersmiths
there had, as we are informed, for their device a leathern apron; and
when it members went abroad they used to carry with them a bed which
could be taken to pieces.

At Jerusalem, where this guild was organised under its Rabban, or chief,
it possessed a synagogue and a burying-place of its own. But the
Palestinian workmen, though they kept by each other, had no exclusive
guilds; the principles of “free trade,” so to speak, prevailing among
them. Bazaars and streets were named after them. The workmen of
Jerusalem were specially distinguished for their artistic skill. A whole
valley–that of the Tyropoeon–was occupied by dairies; hence its name,
“valley of cheesemongers.” Even in Isaiah 7:3 we read of “the field of
the fullers,” which lay “at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in
the highway” to Joppa. A whole set of sayings is expressly designated in
the Talmud as “the proverbs of the fullers.”

From their love of building and splendour the Herodian princes must have
kept many tradesmen in constant work. At the re-erection of the Temple
no less than eighteen thousand were so employed in various handicrafts,
some of them implying great artistic skill. Even before that, Herod the
Great is said to have employed a large number of the most experienced
masters to teach the one thousand priests who were to construct the Holy
Place itself. For, in the building of that part of the Temple no laymen
were engaged.

As we know, neither hammer, axe, chisel, nor any tool of iron was used
within the sacred precincts. The reason of this is thus explained in the
Mishnah, when describing how all the stones for the altar were dug out
of virgin-earth, no iron tool being employed in their preparation: “Iron
is created to cut short the life of man; but the altar to prolong it.
Hence it is not becoming to use that which shortens for that which
lengthens” (Midd. iii. 4).

Those who know the magnificence and splendour of that holy house will be
best able to judge what skill in workmanship its various parts must have
required. An instance may be interesting on account of its connection
with the most solemn fact of New Testament history. We read in the
Mishnah (Shek. viii. 5): “Rabbi Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, said, in
the name of Rabbi Simeon, the son of the (former) Sagan (assistant of
the high-priest): The veil (of the Most Holy Place) was an handbreadth
thick, and woven of seventy-two twisted plaits; each plait consisted of
twenty-four threads” (according to the Talmud, six threads of each of
the four Temple-colours–white, scarlet, blue, and gold). “It was forty
cubits long, and twenty wide (sixty feet by thirty), and made of
eighty-two myriads” (the meaning of this in the Mishnah is not plain).
“Two of these veils were made every year, and it took three hundred
priests to immerse one” (before use).

These statements must of course be considered as dealing in “round
numbers”; but they are most interesting as helping us to realise, not
only how the great veil of the Temple was rent, when the Lord of that
Temple died on the cross, but also how the occurrence could have been
effectually concealed from the mass of the people.

To turn to quite another subject. It is curious to notice in how many
respects times and circumstances have really not changed. The old Jewish
employers of labour seem to have had similar trouble with their men to
that of which so many in our own times loudly complain. We have an
emphatic warning to this effect, to beware of eating fine bread and
giving black bread to one’s workmen or servants; not to sleep on
feathers and give them straw pallets, more especially if they were
co-religionists, for, as it is added, he who gets a Hebrew slave gets
his master!

Possibly something of this kind was on the mind of St. Paul when he
wrote this most needful precept (1 Tim 6:1,2): “Let as many servants as
are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that
the name of God and His doctrine be not blasphemed. And they that have
believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren;
but rather do them service, because they are believing and beloved,
partakers of the benefit.” But really there is nothing “new under the
sun!” Something like the provisions of a mutual assurance appear in the
associations of muleteers and sailors, which undertook to replace a
beast or a ship that had been lost without negligence on the part of the
owner.

Nay, we can even trace the spirit of trade-unionism in the express
permission of the Talmud (Bab. B. 9) to tradesmen to combine to work
only one or two days in the week, so as to give sufficient employment to
every workman in a place. We close with another quotation in the same
direction, which will also serve to illustrate the peculiar mode of
Rabbinical comment on the words of Scripture: “‘He doeth no evil to his
neighbour-’-this refers to one tradesman not interfering with the trade
of another!”

Chapter 12. Commerce
====================

The remarkable change which we have noticed in the views of Jewish
authorities, from contempt to almost affectation of manual labour, could
certainly not have been arbitrary. But as we fail to discover here any
religious motive, we can only account for it on the score of altered
political and social circumstances. So long as the people were, at least
nominally, independent, and in possession of their own land, constant
engagement in a trade would probably mark an inferior social stage, and
imply either voluntary or necessary preoccupation with the things of
this world that perish with the using. It was otherwise when Judaea was
in the hands of strangers.

Then honest labour afforded the means, and the only means, of manly
independence. To engage in it, just sufficient to secure this result, to
“stand in need of no one”; to be able to hold up one’s head before
friend and foe; to make unto God moral sacrifice of natural inclination,
strength and time, so as to be able freely and independently to devote
oneself to the study of the Divine law, was a noble resolve. And it
brought its own reward. If, on the one hand, the alternation of physical
and mental labour was felt to be healthy, on the other–and this had been
the main object in view–there never were men more fearlessly outspoken,
more unconcerned as to mere personality or as to consequences, more
independent in thought and word than these Rabbis.

We can understand the withering scorn of St. Jude (Jude 16) towards
those “having men’s persons in admiration,” literally, “admiring
faces”–an expression by which the LXX translate the “respect” or
“regard,” or “acceptance” of persons (the nasa panim) mentioned in
Leviticus 19:15; Deuteronomy 10:17; Job 13:10; Proverbs 18:5, and many
other passages. In this respect also, as so often, St. Paul spoke as a
true Jew when he wrote (Gal 2:6): “But of these who seemed to be
somewhat, whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: the face of
man God accepteth not.”

The Mishnah, indeed, does not in so many words inform us how the change
in public feeling, to which we have referred, was brought about. But
there are plenty of hints to guide us in certain short caustic sentences
which would be inexplicable, unless read in the light of the history of
that time. Thus, as stated in the previous chapter, Shemaajah
admonished: “Love work, hate Rabbiship, and do not press on the notice
of those in power.”

Similarly, Avtaljon warned the sages to be cautious in their words, for
fear of incurring banishment for themselves and their followers (Ab. i.
10,11). And Rabbi Gamaliel II had it (ii. 3): “Be cautious with the
powers that be, for they only seek intercourse with a person for their
own advantage. They are as if they loved you, when it serves for their
profit, but in the hour of his need they do not stand by a man.” In the
same category of sayings for the times we may rank this of Rabbi
Matithja: “Meet every one with a salutation of peace, and prefer to be
the tail of lions, but be not the head to foxes.” It is needless to
multiply similar quotations, all expressive of an earnest desire for
honourable independence through personal exertion.

Quite different form those as to trades were the Rabbinical views about
commerce, as we shall immediately show. In fact, the general adoption of
business, which has so often been made the subject of jeer against
Israel, marks yet another social state, and a terrible social necessity.
When Israel was scattered by units, hundreds, or even thousands, but
still a miserable, vanquished, homeless, weak minority among the nations
of the earth–avoided, down-trodden, and at the mercy of popular
passion–no other course was open to them than to follow commerce.

Even if Jewish talent could have identified itself with the pursuits of
the Gentiles, would public life have been open to them–we shall not say,
on equal, but, on any terms? Or, to descend a step lower–except in those
crafts which might be peculiarly theirs, could Jewish tradesmen have
competed with those around? Would they even have been allowed to enter
the lists? Moreover, it was necessary for their self-defence–almost for
their existence–that they should gain influence. And in their
circumstances this could only be obtained by the possession of wealth,
and the sole road to this was commerce.

There can be no question that, according to the Divine purpose, Israel
was not intended to be a commercial people. The many restrictions to the
intercourse between Jews and Gentiles, which the Mosaic law everywhere
presents, would alone have sufficed to prevent it. Then there was the
express enactment against taking interest upon loans (Lev 25:36,37),
which must have rendered commercial transactions impossible, even though
it was relaxed in reference to those who lived outside the boundaries of
Palestine (Deu 23:20).

Again, the law of the Sabbatic and of the Jubilee year would have
brought all extended commerce to a standstill. Nor was the land at all
suited for the requirements of trade. True, it possessed ample seaboard,
whatever the natural capabilities of its harbours may have been. But the
whole of that coast, with the harbours of Joppa, Jamneh, Ascalon, Gaza,
and Acco or Ptolemais, remained, with short intervals, in the possession
of the Philistines and Phoenicians. Even when Herod the Great built the
noble harbour of Caesarea, it was almost exclusively used by foreigners
(Josephus, Jew. War, 409-413).

And the whole history of Israel in Palestine points to the same
inference. Only on one occasion, during the reign of Solomon, do we find
anything like attempts to engage in mercantile pursuits on a large
scale. The reference to the “king’s merchants” (1 Kings 10:28,29; 2
Chron 1:16), who imported horses and linen yarn, has been regarded as
indicating the existence of a sort of royal trading company, or of a
royal monopoly. A still more curious inference would almost lead us to
describe Solomon as the first great “Protectionist.”

The expressions in 1 Kings 10:15 point to duties paid by retail and
wholesale importers, the words, literally rendered, indicating as a
source of revenue that “from the traders and from the traffick of the
merchants”; both words in their derivation pointing to foreign trade,
and probably distinguishing them as retail and wholesale. We may here
remark that, besides these duties and the tributes from “protected”
kings (1 Kings 9:15), Solomon’s income is described (1 Kings 10:14) as
having amounted, at any rate, in one year, to the enormous sum of
between two and three million sterling! Part of this may have been
derived from the king’s foreign trade.

For we know (1 Kings 9:26, etc.; 2 Chron 8:17, etc.) that King Solomon
built a navy at Ezion-geber, on the Red Sea, which port David had taken.
This navy traded to Ophir, in company with the Phoenicians. But as this
tendency of King Solomon’s policy was in opposition to the Divine
purpose, so it was not lasting. The later attempt of King Jehoshaphat to
revive the foreign trade signally failed; “for the ships were broken at
Ezion-geber” (1 Kings 22:48; 2 Chron 20:36,37), and soon afterwards the
port of Ezion-geber passed once more into the hands of Edom (2 Kings
8:20).

With this closes the Biblical history of Jewish commerce in Palestine,
in the strict sense of that term. But our reference to what may be
called the Scriptural indications against the pursuit of commerce brings
up a kindred subject, for which, although confessedly a digression, we
claim a hearing, on account of its great importance.

Those most superficially acquainted with modern theological controversy
are aware, that certain opponents of the Bible have specially directed
their attacks against the antiquity of the Pentateuch, although they
have not yet arranged among themselves what parts of the Pentateuch were
written by different authors, nor by how many, nor by whom, nor at what
times, nor when or by whom they were ultimately collected into one book.
Now what we contend for in this connection is, that the legislation of
the Pentateuch affords evidence of its composition before the people
were settled in Palestine.

We arrive at this conclusion in the following manner. Supposing a code
of laws and institutions to be drawn up by a practical legislator–for
unquestionably they were in force in Israel–we maintain, that no human
lawgiver could have ordered matters for a nation in a settled state as
we find it done in the Pentateuch. The world has had many speculative
constitutions of society drawn up by philosophers and theorists, from
Plato to Rousseau and Owen.

None of these would have suited, or even been possible in a settled
state of society. But no philosopher would ever have imagined or thought
of such laws as some of the provisions in the Pentateuch. To select only
a few, almost at random. Let the reader think of applying, for example,
to England, such provisions as that all males were to appear three times
a year in the place which the Lord would choose, or those connected with
the Sabbatic and the Jubilee years, or those regulating religious and
charitable contributions, or those concerning the corners of fields, or
those prohibiting the taking of interest or those connected with the
Levitical cities.

Then let any one seriously ask himself, whether such institutions could
have been for the first time propounded or introduced by a legislator at
the time of David, or Hezekiah, or of Ezra? The more we think of the
spirit and of the details of the Mosaic legislation, the stronger grows
our conviction, that such laws and institutions could have been only
introduced before the people actually settled in the land. So far as we
are aware, this line of argument has not before been proposed; and yet
it seems necessary for our opponents to meet this preliminary and, as we
think, insuperable difficulty of their theory, before we can be asked to
discuss their critical objections.

But to return. Passing from Biblical, or, at least, from Old Testament
to later times, we find the old popular feeling in Palestine on the
subject of commerce still existing. For once Josephus here correctly
expresses the views of his countrymen. “As for ourselves,” he writes
(Ag. Apion, i, 60-68), “we neither inhabit a maritime country, nor do we
delight in merchandise, nor in such a mixture with other men as arises
from it; but the cities we dwell in are remote from the sea, and having
a fruitful country for our habitation, we take pains in cultivating that
only.” Nor were the opinions of the Rabbis different.

We know in what low esteem pedlars were held by the Jewish authorities.
But even commerce was not much more highly regarded. It has been rightly
said that, “in the sixty-three tractates of which the Talmud is
composed, scarcely a word occurs in honour of commerce, but much to
point out the dangers attendant upon money-making.” “Wisdom,” says Rabbi
Jochanan, in explanation of Deuteronomy 30:12, “‘is not in heaven’–that
is, it is not found with those who are proud; neither is it ‘beyond the
sea’–that is, it will not be found among traders nor among merchants”
(Er. 55 a).

Still more to the point are the provisions of the Jewish law as to those
who lent money on interest, or took usury. “The following,” we read in
Rosh Hash. 8. 8, “are unfit for witness-bearing: he who plays with dice
(a gambler); he who lends on usury; they who train doves (either for
betting purposes, or as decoys); they who trade in seventh year’s
products, and slaves.” Even more pungent is this, almost reminding one
of the Rabbinic gloss: “Of the calumniator God says, ‘There is not room
in the world for him and Me’”–“The usurer bites off a piece from a man,
for he takes from him that which he has not given him” (Bab. Mez. 60 b).
A few other kindred sayings may here find a place. “Rabbi Meir saith: Be
sparing (doing little) in business, but busy in the Thorah” (Ab. iv. 2).

Among the forty-eight qualifications for acquiring the Thorah, “little
business” is mentioned (vi. 6). Lastly, we have this from Hillel,
concluding with a very noble saying, worthy to be preserved to all times
and in all languages: “He who engages much in business cannot become a
sage; and in a place where there are no men, strive thou to be a man.”

It will perhaps have been observed, that, with the changing
circumstances of the people, the views as to commerce also underwent a
slow process of modification, the main object now being to restrict such
occupations, and especially to regulate them in accordance with
religion. Inspectorships of weights and measures are of comparatively
late date in our own country. The Rabbis in this, as in so many other
matters, were long before us. They appointed regular inspectors, whose
duty it was to go from market to market, and, more than that, to fix the
current market prices (Baba B. 88).

The prices for produce were ultimately determined by each community. Few
merchants would submit to interference with what is called the law of
supply and demand. But the Talmudical laws against buying up grain and
withdrawing it from sale, especially at a time of scarcity, are
exceedingly strict. Similarly, it was prohibited artificially to raise
prices, especially of produce. Indeed, it was regarded as cheating to
charge a higher profit than sixteen per cent. In general, some would
have it that in Palestine no one should make profit out of the
necessaries of life. Cheating was declared to involve heavier punishment
than a breach of some of the other moral commandments. For the latter,
it was argued, might be set right by repentance. But he who cheated took
in not merely one or several persons, but every one; and how could that
ever be set right? And all were admonished to remember, that “God
punisheth even where the eye of an earthly judge cannot penetrate.”

We have spoken of a gradual modification of Rabbinical views with the
changing circumstances of the nation. This probably comes out most
clearly in the advice of the Talmud (Baba M. 42), to divide one’s money
into three parts–to lay out one in the purchase of land, to invest the
second in merchandise, and to keep the third in hand as cash. But there
was always this comfort, which Rab enumerated among the blessings of the
next world, that there was no commerce there (Ber. 17 a).

And so far as this world was concerned, the advice was to engage in
business, in order with the profit made to assist the sages in their
pursuits, just as Sebua, one of the three wealthy men of Jerusalem, had
assisted the great Hillel. From what has been said, it will be inferred
that the views expressed as to Palestinian, or even Babylonian Jews, did
not apply to those who were “dispersed abroad” among the various Gentile
nations. To them, as already shown, commerce would be a necessity, and,
in fact, the grand staple of their existence. If this may be said of all
Jews of the dispersion, it applies specially to that community which was
the richest and most influential among them–we mean the Jews of
Alexandria.

Few phases, even in the ever-changeful history of the Jewish people, are
more strange, more varied in interest, or more pathetic than those
connected with the Jews of Alexandria. The immigration of Jews into
Egypt commenced even before the Babylonish captivity. Naturally it
received great increase from that event, and afterwards from the murder
of Gedaliah. But the real exodus commenced under Alexander the Great.

That monarch accorded to the Jews in Alexandria the same rights as its
Greek inhabitants enjoyed, and so raised them to the rank of the
privileged classes. Henceforth their numbers and their influence grew
under successive rulers. We find them commanding Egyptian armies,
largely influencing Egyptian thought and inquiry, and partially
leavening it by the translation of the Holy Scriptures into Greek. Of
the so-called Temple of Onias at Leontopolis, which rivalled that of
Jerusalem, and of the magnificence of the great synagogue at Alexandria,
we cannot speak in this place.

There can be no doubt that, in the Providence of God, the location of so
many Jews in Alexandria, and the mental influence which they acquired,
were designed to have an important bearing on the later spread of the
Gospel of Christ among the Greek-speaking and Grecian-thinking educated
world. In this, the Greek translation of the Old Testament was also
largely helpful. Indeed, humanly speaking, it would have scarcely been
possible without it.

At the time of Philo the number of Jews in Egypt amounted to no less
than one million. In Alexandria they occupied two out of the five
quarters of the town, which were called after the first five letters of
the alphabet. They lived under rulers of their own, almost in a state of
complete independence. Theirs was the quarter Delta, along the seashore.
The supervision of navigation, both by sea and river, was wholly
entrusted to them. In fact, the large export trade, especially in
grain–and Egypt was the granary of the world–was entirely in their
hands.

The provisioning of Italy and of the world was the business of the Jews.
It is a curious circumstance, as illustrating how little the history of
the world changes, that during the troubles at Rome the Jewish bankers
of Alexandria were able to obtain from their correspondents earlier and
more trustworthy political tidings than any one else. This enabled them
to declare themselves in turn for Caesar and for Octavius, and to secure
the full political and financial results flowing from such policy, just
as the great Jewish banking houses at the beginning of this century were
similarly able to profit by earlier and more trustworthy news of events
than the general public could obtain.

But no sketch of commerce among the early Jews, however brief, would be
complete without some further notice both of the nature of the trade
carried on, and of the legal regulations which guarded it. The business
of the travelling hawker, of course, was restricted to negotiating an
exchange of the products of one district for those of another, to buying
and selling articles of home produce, or introducing among those who
affected fashion or luxury in country districts specimens of the latest
novelties from abroad.

The foreign imports were, with the exception of wood and metals, chiefly
articles of luxury. Fish from Spain, apples from Crete, cheese from
Bithynia; lentils, beans, and gourds from Egypt and Greece; plates from
Babylon, wine from Italy, beer from Media, household vessels from Sidon,
baskets from Egypt, dresses from India, sandals from Laodicea, shirts
from Cilicia, veils from Arabia–such were some of the goods imported. On
the other hand, the exports from Palestine consisted of such produce as
wheat, oil, balsam, honey, figs, etc., the value of exports and imports
being nearly equal, and the balance, if any, in favour of Palestine.

Then, as to the laws regulating trade and commerce, they were so minute
as almost to remind us of the Saviour’s strictures on Pharisaic
punctiliousness. Several Mishnic tractates are full of determinations on
these points. “The dust of the balances” is a strictly Jewish idea and
phrase. So far did the law interfere, as to order that a wholesale
dealer must cleanse the measures he used once every month, and a retail
dealer twice a week; that all weights were to be washed once a week, and
the balances wiped every time they had been used. By way of making
assurance doubly sure, the seller had to give rather more than an ounce
in addition to every ten pounds, if the article consisted of fluids, or
half that if of solids (Baba B. v. 10, 11).

Here are some of the principal ordinances relating to trade. A bargain
was not considered closed until both parties had taken possession of
their respective properties. But after one of them had received the
money, it was deemed dishonourable and sinful for the other to draw
back. In case of overcharge, or a larger than the lawful profit, a
purchaser had the right of returning the article, or claiming the
balance in money, provided he applied for it after an interval not
longer than was needful for showing the goods to another merchant or to
a relative.

Similarly, the seller was also protected. Money-changers were allowed to
charge a fixed discount for light money, or to return it within a
certain period, if below the weight at which they had taken it. A
merchant might not be pressed to name the lowest price, unless the
questioner seriously intended to purchase; nor might he be even reminded
of a former overcharge to induce him to lower his prices. Goods of
different qualities might not be mixed, even though the articles added
were of superior value.

For the protection of the public, agriculturists were forbidden to sell
in Palestine wine diluted with water, unless in places where such was
the known usage. Indeed, one of the Rabbis went so far as to blame
merchants who gave little presents to children by way of attracting the
custom of their parents. It is difficult to imagine what they would have
said to the modern practice of giving discount to servants. All agreed
in reprobating as deceit every attempt to give a better appearance to an
article exposed for sale. Purchases of corn could not be concluded till
the general market-price had been fixed.

But beyond all this, every kind of speculation was regarded as akin to
usury. With the delicacy characteristic of Rabbinical law, creditors
were expressly prohibited from using anything belonging to a debtor
without paying for it, from sending him on an errand, or even accepting
a present from one who had solicited an advance. So punctilious were the
Rabbis in avoiding the appearance of usury, that a woman who borrowed a
loaf from her neighbour was told to fix its value at the time, lest a
sudden rise in flour should make the loaf returned worth more than that
borrowed!

If a house or a field were rented, a somewhat higher charge might be
made, if the money were not paid in advance, but not in the case of a
purchase. It was regarded as an improper kind of speculation to promise
a merchant one-half of the profit on the sales he effected, or to
advance him money and then allow him one-half of the profits on his
transactions. In either case, it was thought, a merchant would be
exposed to more temptation. By law he was only entitled to a commission
and to compensation for his time and trouble.

Equally strict were the regulations affecting debtor and creditor.
Advances were legally secured by regular documents, drawn out at the
expense of the debtor, and attested by witnesses, about whose signature
minute directions are given. To prevent mistakes, the sum lent was
marked at the top, as well as in the body of the document. A person was
not taken as security for another after the loan was actually
contracted. In reference to interest (which among the Romans was
calculated monthly), in regard to pledges, and in dealing with insolvent
debtors, the mildness of the Jewish law has never been equalled.

It was lawful, under certain restrictions, to take a pledge, and in the
event of non-payment to sell it: but wearing apparel, bedding, the
ploughshare, and all articles required for the preparation of food were
excepted. Similarly, it was unlawful, under any circumstances, to take a
pledge from a widow, or to sell that which belonged to her. These are
only some of the provisions by which the interest of all parties were
not only guarded, but a higher religious tone sought to be imparted to
ordinary life. Those who are acquainted with the state of matters among
the nations around, and the cruel exactions of the Roman law, will best
appreciate the difference in this respect also between Israel and the
Gentiles.

The more the Rabbinical code is studied, the higher will be our
admiration of its provisions, characterised as these are by wisdom,
kindliness, and delicacy, we venture to say, far beyond any modern
legislation. Not only the history of the past, the present privileges,
and the hope connected with the promises, but the family, social, and
public life which he found among his brethren would attach a Jew to his
people. Only one thing was awanting–but that, alas! the “one thing
needful.” For, in the language of St. Paul (Rom 10:2), “I bear them
record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.”

Chapter 13. Among the People, and with the Pharisees
====================================================

It would have been difficult to proceed far either in Galilee or in
Judaea without coming into contact with an altogether peculiar and
striking individuality, differing from all around, and which would at
once arrest attention. This was the Pharisee. Courted or feared, shunned
or flattered, reverently looked up to or laughed at, he was equally a
power everywhere, both ecclesiastically and politically, as belonging to
the most influential, the most zealous, and the most closely-connected
religions fraternity, which in the pursuit of its objects spared neither
time nor trouble, feared no danger, and shrunk from no consequences.

Familiar as the name sounds to readers of the New Testament and students
of Jewish history, there is no subject on which more crude or inaccurate
notions prevail than that of Pharisaism, nor yet any which, rightly
understood, gives fuller insight into the state of Judaism at the time
of our Lord, or better illustrates His words and His deeds. Let us first
view the Pharisee as, himself seemingly unmoved, he moves about among
the crowd, which either respectfully gives way or curiously looks after
him.

There was probably no town or village inhabited by Jews which had not
its Pharisees, although they would, of course, gather in preference
about Jerusalem with its Temple, and what, perhaps would have been even
dearer to the heart of a genuine Pharisee–its four hundred and eighty
synagogues, its Sanhedrims (great and small), and its schools of study.
There could be no difficulty in recognising such an one. Walking behind
him, the chances were, he would soon halt to say his prescribed prayers.

If the fixed time for them had come, he would stop short in the middle
of the road, perhaps say one section of them, move on, again say another
part, and so on, till, whatever else might be doubted, there could be no
question of the conspicuousness of his devotions in market-place or
corners of streets. There he would stand, as taught by the traditional
law, would draw his feet well together, compose his body and clothes,
and bend so low “that every vertebra in his back would stand out
separate,” or, at least, till “the skin over his heart would fall into
folds” (Ber. 28 b).

The workman would drop his tools, the burden-bearer his load; if a man
had already one foot in the stirrup, he would withdraw it. The hour had
come, and nothing could be suffered to interrupt or disturb him. The
very salutation of a king, it was said, must remain unreturned; nay, the
twisting of a serpent around one’s heel must remain unheeded. Nor was it
merely the prescribed daily seasons of prayer which so claimed his
devotions.

On entering a village, and again on leaving it, he must say one or two
benedictions; the same in passing through a fortress, in encountering
any danger, in meeting with anything new, strange, beautiful, or
unexpected. And the longer he prayed the better. In the view of the
Rabbis this had a twofold advantage; for “much prayer is sure to be
heard,” and “prolix prayer prolongeth life.” At the same time, as each
prayer expressed, and closed with a benediction of the Divine Name,
there would be special religious merit attaching to mere number, and a
hundred “benedictions” said in one day was a kind of measure of great
piety.

But on meeting a Pharisee face to face his identity could still less be
doubted. His self-satisfied, or else mock-modest or ostentatiously meek
bearing would betray him, even irrespective of his superciliousness
towards others, his avoidance of every touch of persons or things which
he held unclean, and his extravagant religious displays.

We are, of course, speaking of the class, or, rather, the party, as
such, and of its tendencies, and not of all the individuals who composed
it. Besides, there were, as we shall by-and-by see, various degrees
among them, from the humblest Pharisee, who was simply a member of the
fraternity, only initiated in its lowest degree, or perhaps even a
novice, to the most advanced chasid, or “pietist.” The latter would, for
example, bring every day a trespass-offering, in case he had committed
some offence of which he was doubtful.

How far the punctiliousness of that class, in observing the laws of
Levitical purity, would go, may be gathered from a Rabbi, who would not
allow his son to remain in the room while he was in the hands of the
surgeon, lest he might be defiled by contact with the amputated limb,
which, of course, was thenceforth dead. Another chasid went so far in
his zeal for Sabbath observance, that he would not build up again his
house because he had thought about it on the Sabbath; and it was even
declared by some improper to intrust a letter to a Gentile, lest he
should deliver it on the holy day!

These are real, but by no means extreme cases. For, a Rabbi,
contemporary with the apostles, was actually obliged to denounce, as
incompatible with the continuance of society, the vagaries of the
so-called “Chasid Shoteh,” or silly pietist. What was meant by these
will appear from such instances as the refusal to save a woman from
drowning for fear of touching a female, or waiting to put off the
phylacteries before stretching out a hand to rescue a child from the
water!

Readers of the New Testament will remember that the very dress of the
Pharisees differed from that of others. Simple as the garb of Orientals
is, it must not be thought that, in those days, wealth, rank, and luxury
were not recognisable quite as much, if not more, than among ourselves.
No doubt the polished Grecian, the courtly Herodian, the wealthy
Sadducee, as well as many of the lady patronesses of the Pharisees
(Josephus, Ant. xvii, 32-45), would have been easily recognised. At any
rate, Jewish writings give us such descriptions of their toilette, that
we can almost transport ourselves among the fashionable society of
Tiberias, Caesarea, Jerusalem, or that of “the dispersed,” who were
residents of Alexandria or of the wealthy towns of Babylonia.

Altogether, it seems, eighteen garments were supposed to complete an
elegant toilette. The material, the colour, and the cut distinguished
the wearer. While the poor used the upper garment for a covering at
night, the fashionable wore the finest white, embroidered, or even
purple garments, with curiously-wrought silk girdles. It was around this
upper garment that “the borders” were worn which the Pharisees
“enlarged” (Matt 23:5). Of these we shall speak presently.

Meantime we continue our description. The inner garment went down to the
heels. The head-dress consisted of a pointed cap, or kind of turban, of
more or less exquisite material, and curiously wound, the ends often
hanging gracefully behind. Gloves were generally used only for
protection. As for ladies, besides differences in dress, the early
charge of Isaiah (3:16-24) against the daughters of Jerusalem might have
been repeated with tenfold emphasis in New Testament times. We read of
three kinds of veils. The Arabian hung down from the head, leaving the
wearer free to see all around; the veil-dress was a kind of mantilla,
thrown gracefully about the whole person, and covering the head; while
the Egyptian resembled the veil of modern Orientals, covering breast,
neck, chin, and face, and leaving only the eyes free.

The girdle, which was fastened lower than by men, was often of very
costly fabric, and studded with precious stones. Sandals consisted
merely of soles strapped to the feet; but ladies wore also costly
slippers, sometimes embroidered, or adorned with gems, and so arranged
that the pressure of the foot emitted a delicate perfume. It is well
known that scents and “ointments” were greatly in vogue, and often most
expensive (Matt 26:7). The latter were prepared of oil and of home or
foreign perfumes, the dearest being kept in costly alabaster boxes.

The trade of perfumer was, however, looked down upon, not only among the
Jews, but even among heathen nations. But in general society anointing
was combined with washing, as tending to comfort and refreshment. The
hair, the beard, the forehead, and the face, even garlands worn at
feasts, were anointed. But luxury went much farther than all this. Some
ladies used cosmetics, painting their cheeks and blackening their
eyebrows with a mixture of antimony, zinc, and oil. The hair, which was
considered a chief point of beauty, was the object of special care.
Young people wore it long; but in men this would have been regarded as a
token of effeminacy (1 Cor 11:14).

The beard was carefully trimmed, anointed, and perfumed. Slaves were not
allowed to wear beards. Peasant girls tied their hair in a simple knot;
but the fashionable Jewesses curled and plaited theirs, adorning the
tresses with gold ornaments and pearls. The favourite colour was a kind
of auburn, to produce which the hair was either dyed or sprinkled with
gold-dust. We read even of false hair (Shab. vi. 3), just as false teeth
also were worn in Judaea. Indeed, as in this respect also there is
nothing new under the sun, we are not astonished to find mention of
hair-pins and elegant combs, nor to read that some Jewish dandies had
their hair regularly dressed! However, the business of hairdresser was
not regarded as very respectable, any more than that of perfumer.
<sup>**[<sup>51</sup>](#sdfootnote51sym)**</sup>

As for ornaments, gentlemen generally wore a seal, either on the
ring-finger or suspended round the neck. Some of them had also bracelets
above the wrist (commonly of the right arm), made of ivory, gold, or
precious stones strung together. Of course, the fashionable lady was
similarly adorned, adding to the bracelets finger-rings, ankle-rings,
nose-rings, ear-rings, gorgeous head-dresses, necklaces, chains, and
what are nowadays called “charms.” As it may interest some, we shall add
a few sentences of description. The ear-ring was either plain, or had a
drop, a pendant, or a little bell inserted.

The nose-ring, which the traditional law ordered to be put aside on the
Sabbath, hung gracefully over the upper lip, yet so as not to interfere
with the salute of the privileged friend. Two kinds of necklaces were
worn–one close-fitting, the other often consisting of precious stones or
pearls, and hanging down over the chest, often as low as the girdle. The
fashionable lady would wear two or three such chains, to which
smelling-bottles and various ornaments, even heathen “charms,” were
attached. Gold pendants descended from the head-ornament, which
sometimes rose like a tower, or was wreathed in graceful snake-like
coils.

The anklets were generally so wrought as in walking to make a sound like
little bells. Sometimes the two ankle-rings were fastened together,
which would oblige the fair wearer to walk with small, mincing steps. If
to all this we add gold and diamond pins, and say that our very brief
description is strictly based upon contemporary notices, the reader will
have some idea of the appearance of fashionable society.

The sketch just given will be of some practical use if it helps us more
fully to realise the contrast presented by the appearance of the
Pharisee. Whether sternly severe, blandly meek, or zealously earnest, he
would carefully avoid all contact with one who was not of the
fraternity, or even occupied an inferior degree in it, as we shall
by-and-by show. He would also be recognisable by his very garb. For, in
the language of our Lord, the Pharisees made “broad their phylacteries,”
and “enlarged the borders of their garments.”

The latter observance, at least so far as concerned the wearing of
memorial fringes on the borders of the garments–not the conspicuous
enlargement of these borders–rested really on a Divine ordinance (Num
15:37; Deu 22:12). In Scripture these fringes are prescribed to be of
blue, the symbolical colour of the covenant; but the Mishnah allows them
also to be white (Men. iv. 1). They are not unfrequently referred to in
the New Testament (Matt 9:20, 14:36, 23:5; Mark 6:56; Luke 8:44). As
already stated, they were worn on the border of the outer garment–no
doubt by every pious Israelite.

Later Jewish mysticism found in this fringed border deep references to
the manner in which the Shechinah enwrapped itself in creation, and
called the attention of each Israelite to the fact that, if in Numbers
15:39 we read (in the Hebrew), “Ye shall look upon him” [not “it,” as in
our Authorised Version] “and remember,” this change of gender (for the
Hebrew word for “fringes” is feminine) indicated–“that, if thou doest
so, it is as much as if thou sawest the throne of the Glory, which is
like unto blue.” And thus believing, the pious Jew would cover in prayer
his head with this mysterious fringed garment; in marked contrast to
which St. Paul declares all such superstitious practices as dishonouring
(1 Cor 11:4). <sup>**[<sup>52</sup>](#sdfootnote52sym)**</sup>

If the practice of wearing borders with fringes had Scriptural
authority, we are well convinced that no such plea could be urged for
the so-called “phylacteries.” The observance arose from a literal
interpretation of Exodus 13:9, to which even the later injunction in
Deuteronomy 6:8 gives no countenance. This appears even from its
repetition in Deuteronomy 11:18, where the spiritual meaning and purport
of the direction is immediately indicated, and from a comparison with
kindred expressions, which evidently could not be taken literally–such
as Proverbs 3:3, 6:21, 7:3; Canticles 8:6; Isaiah 49:16.

The very term used by the Rabbis for phylacteries–“tephillin,”
prayer-fillets–is comparatively modern origin, in so far as it does not
occur in the Hebrew Old Testament. The Samaritans did not acknowledge
them as of Mosaic obligation, any more than do the Karaite Jews, and
there is, what seems to us, sufficient evidence, even from Rabbinical
writings, that in the time of Christ phylacteries were not universally
worn, nor yet by the priests while officiating in the Temple. Although
the words of our Lord seem only expressly to condemn the making broad of
the phylacteries, for purposes of religious ostentation, it is difficult
to believe that He Himself had worn them. At any rate, while any
ordinary Israelite would only put them on at prayer or on solemn
occasions, the members of the Pharisaic confraternity wore them all day
long. The practice itself, and the views and ordinances connected with
it, are so characteristic of the party, that we shall add a few further
particulars.

The “tephillin” were worn on the left arm, towards the heart, and on the
forehead. They consisted–to describe them roughly–of capsules,
containing, on parchment (that for the forehead on four distinct
parchments), these four passages of Scripture: Exodus 13:1-10, 13:11-16;
Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and 11:13-21. The capsules were fastened on by black
leather straps, which were wound round the arm and hand (seven times
round the former, and three times round the latter), or else fitted to
the forehead in a prescribed and mystically significant manner. The
wearer of them could not be mistaken.

But as for their value and importance in the eyes of the Rabbis, it were
impossible to exaggerate it. They were reverenced as highly as the
Scriptures, and, like them, might be rescued from the flames on a
Sabbath, although not worn, as constituting “a burden!” It was said that
Moses had received the law of their observance from God on Mount Sinai;
that the “tephillin” were more sacred than the golden plate on the
forehead of the high-priest, since its inscription embodied only once
the sacred name of Jehovah, while the writing inside the “tephillin”
contained it not less than twenty-three times; that the command of
wearing them equalled all other commands put together, with many other
similar extravagances.

How far the profanity of the Rabbis in this respect would go, appears
from the circumstance, that they supposed God Himself as wearing
phylacteries (Ber. 6 a). The fact is deduced from Isaiah 62:8, where the
“right hand” by which Jehovah swears is supposed to refer to the law,
according to the last clause of Deuteronomy 33:2; while the expression
“strength of His arm” was applied to the “tephillin,” since the term
“strength” appeared in Psalm 29:11 in connection with God’s people, and
was in turn explained by a reference to Deuteronomy 28:10. For “the
strength” of God’s People (Psa 29:11) is that which would cause all to
“be afraid” of Israel (Deu 28:10); and this latter would be due to their
seeing that Israel was “called by the name of Jehovah,” this ocular
demonstration being afforded through the “tephillin.” Such was the
evidence which traditionalism offered for such a monstrous proposition.

The above may serve as a specimen alike of Rabbinical exegesis and
theological inferences. It will also help us to understand, how in such
a system inconvenient objections, arising from the plain meaning of
Scripture, would be summarily set aside by exalting the interpretations
of men above the teaching of the Bible. This brings us straight to the
charge of our Lord against the Pharisees (Mark 7:13), that they made
“the Word of God of none effect” through their “traditions.”

The fact, terrible as it is, nowhere, perhaps, comes out more strongly
than in connection with these very “tephillin.” We read in the Mishnah
(Sanh. xi. 3), literally, as follows: “It is more punishable to act
against the words of the Scribes than against those of Scripture. If a
man were to say, ‘There is no such thing as “tephillin,”’ in order
thereby to act contrary to the words of Scripture, he is not to be
treated as a rebel. But if he should say, ‘There are five divisions in
the prayer-fillets’ (instead of four in those for the forehead, as the
Rabbis taught), in order to add to the words of the Scribes, he is
guilty.” Assuredly, a more signal instance could scarcely be found of
“teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,” and of, even on their
own showing, “laying aside the commandment of God,” in order to “hold
the tradition of men” (Mark 7:7,8).

Before passing from this subject, it may be convenient to explain the
meaning of the Greek term “phylacteries” for these “tephillin,” and to
illustrate its aptness. It is now almost generally admitted, that the
real meaning of phylacteries is equivalent to amulets or charms. And as
such the Rabbinists really regarded and treated them, however much they
might otherwise have disclaimed all connection with heathen views. In
this connection we are not going to enter into the unsavoury subject of
their heathen superstitions, such as where to find, how to detect, and
by what means to get rid of evil spirits, or how to conjure up demons–as
these are indicated in the Talmud.

Considering the state of civilisation at the time, and the general
prevalence of superstition, we should perhaps have scarcely wondered at
all this, had it not been for the claims which the Rabbis set up to
Divine authority, and the terrible contrast exhibited between their
teaching and that–we will not say of the New, but–of the Old Testament.
In reference to the “phylacteries,” even the language of Josephus (Ant.
iv, 212-213) savours of belief in their magical efficacy; although in
this matter also he is true to himself, showing us, at the same time,
that certain proverbial views of gratitude were already in vogue in his
time. For, writing of the phylacteries, which, he maintains, the Jews
wore in remembrance of their past deliverance, he observes, that this
expression of their gratitude “served not only by way of return for
past, but also by way of invitation of future favours!”

Many instances of the magical ideas attaching to these “amulets” might
be quoted; but the following will suffice. It is said that, when a
certain Rabbi left the audience of some king, he had turned his back
upon the monarch. Upon this, the courtiers would have killed the Rabbi,
but were deterred by seeing that the straps of his “tephillin” shone
like bands of fire about him; thus verifying the promise in Deuteronomy
28:10 (Jer. Ber. v. 1). Indeed, we have it expressly stated in an
ancient Jewish Targum (that on Cant 8:3), that the “tephillin” prevented
all hostile demons from doing injury to any Israelite.

What has been said will in some measure prepare the reader for
investigating the history and influence of the Pharisees at the time of
Christ. Let it be borne in mind, that patriotism and religion equally
combined to raise them in popular esteem. What made Palestine a land
separate and distinct from the heathen nations around, among whom the
ruling families would fain have merged them, was that Jewish element
which the Pharisees represented.

Their very origin as a party stretched back to the great national
struggle which had freed the soil of Palestine from Syrian domination.
In turn, the Pharisees had deserted those Maccabees whom formerly they
had supported, and dared persecution and death, when the descendants of
the Maccabees declined into worldly pomp and Grecian ways, and would
combine the royal crown of David with the high-priest’s mitre. And now,
whoever might fear Herod or his family, the Pharisees at least would not
compromise their principles. Again, were they not the representatives of
the Divine law–not only of that given to Israel on Mount Sinai, but also
of those more secret ordinances which were only verbally communicated to
Moses, in explanation of, and addition to the law?

If they had made “a hedge” around the law, it was only for the safety of
Israel, and for their better separation from all that was impure, as
well as from the Gentiles. As for themselves, they were bound by vows
and obligations of the strictest kind. Their dealings with the world
outside their fraternity, their occupations, their practices, their
bearing, their very dress and appearance among that motley crowd–either
careless, gay, and Grecianising, or self-condemned by a practice in sad
discord with their Jewish profession and principles–would gain for them
the distinction of uppermost rooms at feasts, and chief seats in the
synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men,
Rabbi, Rabbi (“my great one, my great one”), in which their hearts so
much delighted.

In very truth they mostly did represent, in some one or other degree of
their order, what of earnestness and religious zeal there was in the
land. Their name–probably in the first instance not chosen by
themselves–had become to some a byword, to others a party title. And
sadly they had declined from their original tendency–at least in most
cases. They were not necessarily “scribes,” nor “lawyers,” nor yet
“teachers of the law.” Nor were they a sect, in the ordinary sense of
the term. But they were a fraternity, which consisted of various
degrees, to which there was a regular novitiate, and which was bound by
special vows and obligations.

This fraternity was, so to speak, hereditary; so that St. Paul could in
very truth speak of himself as “a Pharisee of the Pharisees”–“a Pharisee
the son of a Pharisee.” That their general principles became dominant,
and that they gave its distinctiveness alike to the teaching and the
practices of the Synagogue, is sufficiently know. But what tremendous
influence they must have wielded to attain this position will best
appear from the single fact, which has apparently been too much
overlooked, of their almost incredibly small numbers. According to
Josephus (Ant. xvii, 32-45), the number of the fraternity amounted at
the time of Herod only to about six thousand. Yet this inconsiderable
minority could cast Judaism in its mould, and for such terrible evil
give its final direction to the nation!

Surely the springs of such a movement must have reached down to the very
heart of Jewish religious life. What these were, and how they affected
the whole community, deserves and requires not merely passing notice,
but special and careful attention.

Chapter 14. The “Fraternity” of Pharisees
=========================================

To realise the state of religious society at the time of our Lord, the
fact that the Pharisees were a regular “order,” and that there were many
such “fraternities,” in great measure the outcome of the original
Pharisees, must always be kept in view. For the New Testament simply
transports us among contemporary scenes and actors, taking the then
existent state of things, so to speak, for granted. But the fact
referred to explains many seemingly strange circumstances, and casts
fresh light upon all.

Thus, if, to choose an illustration, we should wonder how so early as
the morning after the long discussion in the Sanhedrim, which must have
occupied a considerable part of the day, “more than forty men” should
have been found “banded together” under an anathema, neither to eat nor
to drink “till they had killed Paul” (Acts 23:12,21); and, still more,
how such “a conspiracy,” or rather “conjuration,” which, in the nature
of it, would be kept a profound secret, should have become known to
“Paul’s sister’s son” (v 16), the circumstances of the case furnish a
sufficient explanation.

The Pharisees were avowedly a “Chabura”–that is, a fraternity or
“guild”–and they, or some of their kindred fraternities, would furnish
the ready material for such a “band,” to whom this additional “vow”
would be nothing new nor strange, and, murderous though it sounded, only
seem a farther carrying out of the principles of their “order.”

Again, since the wife and all the children of a “chaber,” or member,
were ipso facto members of the “Chabura,” and Paul’s father had been a
“Pharisee” (v 6), Paul’s sister also would by virtue of her birth belong
to the fraternity, even irrespective of the probability that, in
accordance with the principles of the party, she would have married into
a Pharisaical family. Nor need we wonder that the rage of the whole
“order” against Paul should have gone to an extreme, for which ordinary
Jewish zeal would scarcely account.

The day before, the excitement of discussion in the Sanhedrim had
engrossed their attention, and in a measure diverted it from Paul. The
apologetic remark then made (v 9), “If a spirit or an angel hath spoken
to him, let us not fight against God,” coming immediately after the
notice (v 8) that the Sadducees said, there was “neither angel nor
spirit,” may indicate, that the Pharisees were quite as anxious for
dogmatic victory over their opponents as to throw the shield of the
“fraternity” over one of its professed members. But with the night other
and cooler thoughts came.

It might be well enough to defend one of their order against the
Sadducees, but it was intolerable to have such a member in the
fraternity. A grosser outrage on every principle and vow–nay, on the
very reason of being of the whole “Chabura”–could scarcely be conceived
than the conduct of St. Paul and the views which he avowed. Even
regarding him as a simple Israelite, the multitude which thronged the
Temple had, on the day before, been only restrained by the heathens from
executing the summary vengeance of “death by the rebel’s beating.” How
much truer was it as the deliberate conviction of the party, and not
merely the cry of an excited populace, “Away with such a fellow from the
earth; for it is not fit that he should live!”

But while we thus understand the conduct of the Pharisees, we need be
under no apprehension as to the consequences to those “more than forty
men” of their rash vow. The Jerusalem Talmud (Avod. Sar. 40 a) here
furnishes the following curious illustration, which almost reads like a
commentary: “If a man makes a vow to abstain from food, Woe to him if he
eateth, and, Woe to him if he does not eat! If he eateth, he sinneth
against his vow; if he does not eat, he sins against his life. What then
must he do? Let him go before ‘the sages,’ and they will absolve him
from his vow.” In connection with the whole of this matter it is, to say
the least, a very curious coincidence that, at the very time when the
party so acted against St. Paul, or immediately afterwards, three new
enactments should have been passed by Simeon, the son of Gamaliel
(Paul’s teacher), which would exactly meet the case of St. Paul.

The first of these ordained, that in future the children of a “Chaber”
should not be necessarily such, but themselves require special and
individual reception into the “order”; the second, that the previous
conduct of the candidate should be considered before admitting him into
the fraternity; while the third enjoined, that any member who had left
the “order,” or become a publican, should never afterwards be received
back again.

Three words of modern significance, with which of late we have all
become too familiar, will probably better help us to understand the
whole state of matters than more elaborate explanations. They are
connected with that ecclesiastical system which in so many respects
seems the counterpart of Rabbinism. Ultramontanism is a direction of
religious thought; the Ultramontanes are a party; and the Jesuits not
only its fullest embodiment, but an “order,” which, originating in a
revival of the spirit of the Papacy, gave rise to the Ultramontanes as a
party, and, in the wider diffusion of their principles, to
Ultramontanism as a tendency. Now, all this applies equally to the
Pharisees and to Pharisaism. To make the analogy complete, the order of
the Jesuits also consists of four degrees
<sup>**[<sup>53</sup>](#sdfootnote53sym)**</sup> –curiously enough, the
exact number of those in the fraternity of “the Pharisees!”

Like that of the Jesuits, the order of the Pharisees originated in a
period of great religious reaction. They themselves delighted in tracing
their history up to the time of Ezra, and there may have been
substantial, though not literal truth in their claim. For we read in
Ezra 6:21, 9:1, 10:11 and Nehemiah 9:2 of the “Nivdalim,” or those who
had “separated” themselves “from the filthiness of the heathen”; while
in Nehemiah 10:29 we find, that they entered into a “solemn league and
covenant,” with definite vows and obligations. Now, it is quite true
that the Aramaean word “Perishuth” also means “separation,” and that the
“Perushim,” or Pharisees, of the Mishnah are, so far as the meaning of
the term is concerned, “the separated,” or the “Nivdalim” of their
period.

But although they could thus, not only linguistically but historically,
trace their origin to those who had “separated” themselves at the time
of Ezra and Nehemiah, they were not their successors in spirit; and the
difference between the designations “Nivdalim” and “Perushim” marks also
the widest possible internal difference, albeit it may have been
gradually brought about in the course of historical development. All
this will become immediately more plain.

At the time of Ezra, as already noted, there was a great religious
revival among those who had returned to the land of their fathers. The
profession which had of old only characterised individuals in Israel
(Psa 30:4, 31:23, 37:28) was now taken up by the covenanted people as a
whole: they became the “Chasidim” or “pious” (rendered in the Authorised
Version, “saints”). As “Chasidim,” they resolved to be “Nivdalim,” or
“separated from all filthiness of heathenism” around.

The one represented, so to speak, the positive; the other, the negative
element in their religion. It is deeply interesting to notice, how the
former Pharisee (or “separated one”), Paul, had this in view in tracing
the Christian life as that of the true “chasid,” and therefore
“Nivdal”–in opposition to the Pharisees of externalism–in such passages
as 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1, closing with this admonition to "cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness
<sup>**[<sup>54</sup>](#sdfootnote54sym)**</sup> of the flesh and
spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." And so St. Paul’s
former life and thinking seem ever to have served him as the type of the
spiritual realities of his new state.
<sup>**[<sup>55</sup>](#sdfootnote55sym)**</sup>

Two points in Jewish history here claim our special attention, without
attempting to unravel the whole somewhat tangled web of events. The
first is the period immediately after Alexander the Great. It was one of
the objects of the empire which he founded to Grecianise the world; and
that object was fully prosecuted by his successors. Accordingly, we find
a circle of Grecian cities creeping up along the coast, from Anthedon
and Gaza in the south, northwards to Tyre and Seleucia, and eastwards to
Damascus, Gadara, Pella, and Philadelphia, wholly belting the land of
Israel.

Thence the movement advanced into the interior, taking foothold in
Galilee and Samaria, and gathering a party with increasing influence and
spreading numbers among the people. Now it was under these
circumstances, that the “Chasidim” as a party stood out to stem the
torrent, which threatened to overwhelm alike the religion and the
nationality of Israel. The actual contest soon came, and with it the
second grand period in the history of Judaism. Alexander the Great had
died in July 323 BC. About a century and a half later, the “Chasidim”
had gathered around the Maccabees for Israel’s God and for Israel. But
the zeal of the Maccabees soon gave place to worldly ambition and
projects. When these leaders united in their person the high-priestly
with the royal dignity, the party of the “Chasidim” not only deserted
them, but went into open opposition.

They called on them to resign the high-priesthood, and were ready to
suffer martyrdom, as many of them did, for their outspoken convictions.
Thenceforth the “Chasidim” of the early type disappear as a class. They
had, as a party, already given place to the Pharisees–the modern
“Nivdalim”; and when we meet them again they are only a higher order or
branch of the Pharisees–“the pious” of old having, so to speak, become
pietists." Tradition (Men. 40) expressly distinguished “the early
Chasidim” (harishonim) from “the later” (acheronim).

No doubt, those are some of their principles, although tinged with later
colouring, which are handed down as the characteristics of the “chasid”
in such sayings of the Mishnah as: “What is mine is thine, and what is
thine remains thine as well” (P. Ab. V. 10); “Hard to make angry, but
easy to reconcile” (11); “Giving alms, and inducing others to do
likewise” (13); “Going to the house of learning, and at the same time
doing good works” (14).

The earliest mention of the Pharisees occurs at the time of the
Maccabees. As a “fraternity” we meet them first under the rule of John
Hyrcanus, the fourth of the Maccabees from Mattathias (135-105 BC);
although Josephus speaks of them already two reigns earlier, at the time
of Jonathan (Ant. xiii, 171-173). He may have done so by anticipation,
or applying later terms to earlier circumstances, since there can be
little doubt that the Essenes, whom he names at the same time, had not
then any corporate existence. Without questioning that, to use a modern
term, “the direction” existed at the time of Jonathan,
<sup>**[<sup>56</sup>](#sdfootnote56sym)**</sup> we can put our finger
on a definite event with which the origin of “the fraternity” of the
Pharisees is connected. From Jewish writings we learn, that at the time
of Hyrcanus a commission was appointed to inquire throughout the land,
how the Divine law of religious contributions was observed by the
people. <sup>**[<sup>57</sup>](#sdfootnote57sym)**</sup>

The result showed that, while the “therumah,” (see The Temple) or
priestly “heave-offerings,” was regularly given, neither the first or
Levitical tithe, nor yet the so-called “second” or “poor’s tithe,” was
paid, as the law enjoined. But such transgression involved mortal sin,
since it implied the personal use of what really belonged to the Lord.
Then it was that the following arrangements were made. All that the
“country people” (’am ha-aretz) sold was to be considered “demai”–a word
derived from the Greek for “people,” and so betraying the time of its
introduction, but really implying that it was “doubtful” whether or not
it had been tithed. In such cases the buyer had to regard the
“therumah,” and the “poor’s tithe” as still due on what he had
purchased.

On the other hand, the Pharisees formed a “Chabura,” or fraternity, of
which each member–“Chaber,” or “companion”–bound himself to pay these
tithes before use or sale. Each “Chaber” was regarded as “neeman,” or
“credited”–his produce being freely bought and sold by the rest of the
“Chaberim.” Of course, the burden of additional expense which this
involved to each non-“chaber” was very great, since he had to pay
“therumah” and tithe on all that he purchased or used, while the
Pharisee who bought from another Pharisee was free.

One cannot help suspecting that this, in connection with kindred
enactments, which bore very hard upon the mass of the people, while they
left “the Pharisee” untouched, may underlie the charge of our Lord (Matt
23:4): “They bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them
on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of
their fingers.”

But the rigorous discharge of tithes was only one part of the
obligations of a “Chaber.” The other part consisted in an equally
rigorous submission to all the laws of Levitical purity as then
understood. Indeed, the varied questions as to what was, or what made
“clean,” divided the one “order” of Pharisees into members of various
degrees. Four such degrees, according to increasing strictness in
“making clean,” are mentioned.

It would take too long to explain this fourfold gradation in its
details. Suffice it, that, generally speaking, a member of the first
degree was called a “Chaber,” or “Ben hacheneseth,” “son of the
union”–an ordinary Pharisee; while the other three degrees were ranked
together under the generic name of “Teharoth” (purifications). These
latter were probably the “Chasidim” of the later period. The “Chaber,”
or ordinary Pharisee, only bound himself to tithing and avoidance of all
Levitical uncleanness.

The higher degrees, on the other hand, took increasingly strict vows.
Any one might enter “the order” if he took, before three members, the
solemn vow of observing the obligations of the fraternity. A novitiate
of a year (which was afterwards shortened) was, however, necessary. The
wife or widow of a “Chaber,” and his children, were regarded as members
of the fraternity.

Those who entered the family of a “Pharisee” had also to seek admission
into the “order.” The general obligations of a “Chaber” towards those
that were “without” the fraternity were as follows. He was neither to
buy from, nor to sell to him anything, either in a dry or fluid state;
he was neither to eat at his table (as he might thus partake of what had
not been tithed), nor to admit him to his table, unless he had put on
the garments of “Chaber” (as his own old ones might else have carried
defilement); nor to go into any burying-place; nor to give “therumah” or
tithes to any priest who was not a member of the fraternity; nor to do
anything in presence of an “am ha-aretz,” or non-“Chaber,” which brought
up points connected with the laws of purification, etc.

To these, other ordinances, partly of an ascetic character, were added
at a later period. But what is specially remarkable is that not only was
a novitiate required for the higher grades, similar to that on first
entering the order; but that, just as the garment of a non-“chaber”
defiled a “Chaber” of the first degree, that of the latter equally
defiled him of the second degree, and so on.
<sup>**[<sup>58</sup>](#sdfootnote58sym)**</sup>

To sum up then: the fraternity of the Pharisees were bound by these two
vows–that of tithing and that in regard to purifications. As the most
varied questions would here arise in practice, which certainly were not
answered in the law of Moses, the “traditions,” which were supposed to
explain and supplement the Divine law, became necessary. In point of
fact, the Rabbis speak of them in that sense, and describe them as “a
hedge” around Israel and its law. That these traditions should have been
traced up to oral communications made to Moses on Mount Sinai, and also
deduced by ingenious methods from the letter of Scripture, was only a
further necessity of the case.

The result was a system of pure externalism, which often contravened the
spirit of those very ordinances, the letter of which was slavishly
worshipped. To what arrant hypocrisy it often gave rise, appears from
Rabbinical writings almost as much as from the New Testament. We can
understand how those “blind guides” would often be as great a trouble to
their own party as to others. “The plague of Pharisaism” was not an
uncommon expression; and this religious sore is ranked with “a silly
pietist, a cunning sinner, and a woman Pharisee,” as constituting “the
troubles of life” (Sot. iii. 4). “Shall we stop to explain the opinions
of Pharisees?” asks a Rabbi, in supreme contempt for “the order” as
such. “It is as a tradition among the Pharisees,” we read (Ab. de R.
Nathan, 5), “to torment themselves in this world, and yet they will not
get anything in the next.” It was suggested by the Sadducees, that “the
Pharisees would by-and-by subject the globe of the sun itself to their
purifications.”

On the other hand, almost Epicurean sentences are quoted among their
utterances, such as, “Make haste, eat and drink, for the world in which
we are is like a wedding feast”; “If thou possessest anything, make good
cheer of it; for there is no pleasure underneath the sod, and death
gives no respite…Men are like the flowers of the field; some flourish,
while others fade away.”

“Like the flowers of the field!” What far other teaching of another
Rabbi, Whom these rejected with scorn, do the words recall! And when
from their words we turn to the kingdom which He came to found, we can
quite understand the essential antagonism of nature between the two.
Assuredly, it has been a bold stretch of assertion to connect in any way
the origin or characteristics of Christianity with the Rabbis.

Yet, when we bring the picture of Pharisaism, as drawn in Rabbinical
writings, side by side with the sketch of it given by our Lord, we are
struck not only with the life-likeness, but with the selection of the
distinctive features of Pharisaism presented in His reproofs. Indeed, we
might almost index the history of Pharisaism by passages from the New
Testament. The “tithing of mint and anise,” to the neglect of the
weightier matters of the law, and “the cleansing” of the outside–these
twofold obligations of the Pharisees, “hedged around,” as they were, by
a traditionalism which made void the spirit of the law, and which
manifested itself in gross hypocrisy and religious boasting–are they not
what we have just traced in the history of “the order?”

Chapter 15. Relation of the Pharisees to Sadducees and Essenes, and to the Gospel of Christ
===========================================================================================

On taking a retrospective view of Pharisaism, as we have described it,
there is a saying of our Lord which at first sight seems almost
unaccountable. Yet it is clear and emphatic. “All therefore whatsoever
they bid you observe, that observe and do” (Matt 23:3). But if the early
disciples were not to break at once and for ever with the Jewish
community, such a direction was absolutely needful. For, though the
Pharisees were only “an order,” Pharisaism, like modern Ultramontanism,
had not only become the leading direction of theological thought, but
its principles were solemnly proclaimed, and universally acted upon–and
the latter, even by their opponents the Sadducees.

A Sadducee in the Temple or on the seat of judgment would be obliged to
act and decide precisely like a Pharisee. Not that the party had not
attempted to give dominance to their peculiar views. But they were
fairly vanquished, and it is said that they themselves destroyed the
book of Sadducean ordinances, which they had at one time drawn up. And
the Pharisees celebrated each dogmatic victory by a feast! What is
perhaps the oldest post-Biblical Hebrew book–the “Megillath Taanith,” or
roll of fasts–is chiefly a Pharisaic calendar of self-glorification, in
which dogmatic victories are made days when fasting, and sometimes even
mourning, is prohibited.

Whatever, therefore, the dogmatic views of the Sadducees were, and
however they might, where possible, indulge personal bias, yet in office
both parties acted as Pharisees. They were well matched indeed. When a
Sadducean high-priest, on the Feast of Tabernacles, poured out the water
on the ground instead of into the silver funnel of the altar, Maccabean
king though he was, he scarce escaped with his life, and ever afterwards
the shout resounded from all parts of the Temple, “Hold up thy hand,” as
the priest yearly performed this part of the service.

The Sadducees held, that on the Day of Atonement the high-priest should
light the incense before he actually entered the Most Holy Place. As
this was contrary to the views of the Pharisees, they took care to bind
him by an oath to observe their ritual customs before allowing him to
officiate at all. It was in vain that the Sadducees argued, that the
daily sacrifices should not be defrayed from the public treasury, but
from special contributions. They had to submit, and besides to join in
the kind of half-holiday which the jubilant majority inscribed in their
calendar to perpetuate the memory of the decision.

The Pharisees held, that the time between Easter and Pentecost should be
counted from the second day of the feast; the Sadducees insisted that it
should commence with the literal “Sabbath” after the festive day. But,
despite argument, the Sadducees had to join when the solemn procession
went on the afternoon of the feast to cut down the “first sheaf,” and to
reckon Pentecost as did their opponents.

We have here referred to only a few of the differences in ritual between
the views of the Sadducees and those of the Pharisees. The essential
principle of them lay in this, that the Sadducees would hold by the
simple letter of the law–do neither more nor less, whether the
consequences were to make decisions more severe or more easy. The same
principle they applied in their juridical and also in their doctrinal
views. It would take us too much into detail to explain the former. But
the reader will understand how this literality would, as a rule, make
their judicial decisions (or rather such as they had proposed) far more
strict than those of the Pharisees, by a rigidly literal application of
the principle, “an eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth.”

The same holds true in regard to the laws of purification, and to those
which regulated inheritance. The doctrinal views of the Sadducees are
sufficiently known from the New Testament. It is quite true that, in
opposition to Sadducean views as to the non-existence of another world
and the resurrection, the Pharisees altered the former Temple-formula
into “Blessed be God from world to world” (from generation to
generation; or, “world without end”), to show that after the present
there was another life of blessing and punishment, of joy and sorrow.

But the Talmud expressly states that the real principle of the Sadducees
was not, that there was no resurrection, but only that it could not be
proved from the Thorah, or Law. From this there was, of course, but a
short step to the entire denial of the doctrine; and no doubt it was
taken by the vast majority of the party. But here also it was again
their principle of strict literality, which underlay even the most
extreme of their errors.

This principle was indeed absolutely necessary to their very existence.
We have traced the Pharisees not only to a definite period, but to a
special event; and we have been able perfectly to explain their name as
“the separated.” Not that we presume they gave it to themselves, for no
sect or party ever takes a name; they all pretend to require no
distinctive title, because they alone genuinely and faithfully represent
the truth itself. But when they were called Pharisees, the “Chaberim,”
no doubt, took kindly to the popular designation.

It was to them–to use an illustration–what the name “Puritans” was to a
far different and opposite party in the Church. But the name “Sadducee”
is involved in quite as much obscurity as the origin of the party. Let
us try to cast some fresh light upon both–only premising that the common
derivations of their name, whether from the high-priest Zadok, or from a
Rabbi called Zadok, whose fundamental principle of not seeking reward in
religion they were thought to have misunderstood and misapplied, or from
the Hebrew word “zaddikim”–the righteous–are all unsatisfactory, and yet
may all contain elements of truth.

There can be no question that the “sect” of the Sadducees originated in
a reaction against the Pharisees. If the latter added to the law their
own glosses, interpretations, and traditions, the Sadducee took his
stand upon the bare letter of the law. He would have none of their
additions and supererogations; he would not be righteous overmuch.
Suffice it for him to have to practise “zedakah,” “righteousness.” We
can understand how this shibboleth of theirs became, in the mouth of the
people, the byname of a party–some using it ironically, some
approvingly. By-and-by the party no doubt took as kindly to the name as
the Pharisees did to theirs.

Thus far, then, we agree with those who derive the title of Sadducees
from “zaddikim.” But why the grammatically-unaccountable change from
“zaddikim” to “zaddukim?” May it not be that the simple but significant
alteration of a letter had, after a not uncommon fashion, originated
with their opponents, as if they would have said: “You are ‘zaddikim?’
Nay, rather, ‘zaddukim’” from the Aramaean word “zadu” (wasting or
desolation)–meaning, you are not upholders but destroyers of
righteousness? This origin of the name would in no way be inconsistent
with the later attempts of the party to trace up their history either to
the high-priest Zadok, or to one of the fathers of Jewish
traditionalism, whose motto they ostentatiously adopted.

History records not a few similar instances of attempts to trace up the
origin of a religious party. Be this as it may, we can understand how
the adherents of Sadducean opinions belonged chiefly to the rich,
luxurious, and aristocratic party, including the wealthy families of
priests; while, according to the testimony of Josephus, which is
corroborated by the New Testament, the mass of the people, and
especially the women, venerated and supported the Pharisaical party.

Thus the “order” of the “Chaberim” gradually became a popular party,
like the Ultramontanes. Finally, as from the nature of it Pharisaism was
dependent upon traditional lore, it became not only the prevailing
direction of Jewish theological study, but the “Chaber” by-and-by merged
into the Rabbi, the “sage,” or “disciple of the sages”; while the
non-“chaber,” or “am ha-aretz,” became the designation for ignorance of
traditional lore, and neglect of its ordinances. This was specially the
case when the dissolution of the Jewish commonwealth rendered the
obligations of the “fraternity” necessarily impossible.

Under such altered circumstances the old historical Pharisee would often
be no small plague to the leaders of the party, as is frequently the
case with the original adherents and sticklers of a sect in which the
irresistible progress of time has necessarily produced changes.

The course of our investigations has shown, that neither Pharisees nor
Sadducees were a sect, in the sense of separating from Temple or
Synagogue; and also that the Jewish people as such were not divided
between Pharisees and Sadducees. The small number of professed Pharisees
(six thousand) at the time of Herod, the representations of the New
Testament, and even the curious circumstance that Philo never once
mentions the name of Pharisee, confirm the result of our historical
inquiries, that the Pharisees were first an “order,” then gave the name
to a party, and finally represented a direction of theological thought.

The New Testament speaks of no other than these two parties. But
Josephus and Philo also mention the “Essenes.” It is beyond our present
scope either to describe their tenets and practices, or even to discuss
the complex question of the origin of their name. From the nature of it,
the party exercised no great influence, and was but short-lived. They
seem to have combined a kind of higher grade Pharisaism with devotional
views, and even practices, derived from Eastern mysticism, and more
particularly from the Medo-Persian religion.

Of the former, the fact that the one object of all their institutions
was a higher purity, may here be regarded as sufficient evidence. The
latter is apparent from a careful study of their views, as these have
been preserved to us, and from their comparison with the Zoroastrian
system. And of the fact that “Palestine was surrounded by Persian
influences,” there are abundant indications.

As a sect the Essenes never attained a larger number than four thousand;
and as they lived apart from the rest, neither mingling in their society
nor in their worship, and–as a general rule–abstained from marriage,
they soon became extinct. Indeed, Rabbinical writings allude to quite a
number of what may probably be described as sectaries, all of them more
or less distinctly belonging to the mystical and ascetic branch of
Pharisaism.

We here name, first, the “Vathikin,” or “strong ones,” who performed
their prayers with the first dawn; secondly, the “Toble Shachrith,” or
“morning baptists,” who immersed before morning prayer, so as to utter
the Divine Name only in a state of purity; thirdly, the “Kehala
Kadisha,” or “holy congregation,” who spent a third of the day in
prayer, a third in study, and a third in labour; fourthly, the “Banaim,”
or “builders,” who, besides aiming after highest purity, occupied
themselves with mystical studies about God and the world; fifthly, the
“Zenuim,” or “secret pious,” who besides kept their views and writings
secret; sixthly, the “Nekije hadaath,” “men of a pure mind,” who were
really separatists from their brethren; seventhly, the “Chashaim,” or
“mysterious ones”; and lastly, the “Assiim,” “helpers” or “healers,” who
professed to possess the right pronunciation of the sacred Name of
Jehovah, with all that this implied.

If in any of the towns of Judaea one had met the strange apparition of a
man dressed wholly in white, whose sandals and garments perhaps bore
signs of age–for they might not be put away till quite worn out–but who
was scrupulously clean, this man was an Essene. The passers would stop
short and look after him with mingled reverence and curiosity. For he
was but rarely seen in town or village–the community separating from the
rest of the people, and inhabiting desert places, specially the
neighbourhood of the Dead Sea; and the character of the “order” for
asceticism and self-denial, as well as for purity, was universally
known.

However strictly they observed the Sabbath, it was in their own
synagogues; and although they sent gifts to the altar, they attended not
the Temple nor offered sacrifices, partly because they regarded their
arrangements as not sufficiently Levitically clean, and partly because
they came to consider their own table an altar, and their common meals a
sacrifice. They formed an “order,” bound by the strictest vows, taken
under terrible oaths, and subject to the most rigorous disciplines. The
members abstained from wine, meat, and oil, and most of them also from
marriage. They had community of goods; were bound to poverty, chastity,
and obedience to their superiors.

Purity of morals was enjoined, especially in regard to speaking the
truth. To take an oath was prohibited, as also the keeping of slaves.
The order consisted of four grades; contact with one of a lower always
defiling him of the higher grade. The novitiate lasted two years, though
at the end of the first the candidate was taken into closer fellowship.
The rule was in the hands of “elders,” who had the power of admission
and expulsion–the latter being almost equivalent to death by starvation,
as the Essene had bound himself by a terrible oath not to associate with
others.

Their day began with sunrise, when they went to prayer. Before that,
nothing secular might be spoken. After prayer, they betook themselves to
agricultural labour–for they were not allowed to keep herds and
flocks–or else to works of charity, specially the healing of the sick.
At eleven o’clock they bathed, changed their dress, and then gathered
for the common meal. A priest opened and closed it with prayer. They sat
according to age and dignity; the eldest engaging in serious
conversation, but in so quiet a tone as not to be heard outside.

The young men served. Each had bread and salt handed him, also another
dish; the elders being allowed the condiment of hyssop and the luxury of
warm water. After the meal they put off their clothes, and returned to
work till the evening, when there was another common meal, followed by
mystical hymns and dances, to symbolise the rapt, ecstatic state of
mind.

It is needless to follow the subject farther. Even what has been
said–irrespective of their separation from the world, their punctilious
Sabbath-observance, and views on purification; their opposition to
sacrifices, and notably their rejection of the doctrine of the
resurrection–is surely sufficient to prove that they had no connection
with the origin of Christianity. Assertions of this kind are equally
astonishing to the calm historical student and painful to the Christian.

Yet there can be no doubt that among these mystical sects were preserved
views of the Divine Being, of the Messiah and His kingdom, and of
kindred doctrines, which afterwards appeared in the so-called “secret
tradition” of the Synagogue, and which, as derived from the study of the
prophetic writings, contain marvellous echoes of Christian truth. On
this point, however, we may not here enter.

Christ and the Gospel among Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes! We can
now realise the scene, and understand the mutual relations. The existing
communities, the religious tendencies, the spirit of the age, assuredly
offered no point of attachment–only absolute and essential contrariety
to the kingdom of heaven. The “preparer of the way” could appeal to
neither of them; his voice only cried “in the wilderness.” Far, far
beyond the origin of Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, he had to point
back to the original Paschal consecration of Israel as that which was to
be now exhibited in its reality: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world.” If the first great miracle of Christianity
was the breaking down of the middle wall of partition, the
second–perhaps we should have rather put it first, to realise the
symbolism of the two miracles in Cana–was that it found nothing
analogous in the religious communities around, nothing sympathetic,
absolutely no stem on which to graft the new plant, but was literally
“as a root out of a dry ground,” of which alike Pharisee, Sadducee, and
Essene would say: “He hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see
Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him.”

Chapter 16. Synagogues: Their Origin, Structure and Outward Arrangements
========================================================================

It was a beautiful saying of Rabbi Jochanan (Jer. Ber. v. 1), that he
who prays in his house surrounds and fortifies it, so to speak, with a
wall of iron. Nevertheless, it seems immediately contradicted by what
follows. For it is explained that this only holds good where a man is
alone, but that where there is a community prayer should be offered in
the synagogue. We can readily understand how, after the destruction of
the Temple, and the cessation of its symbolical worship, the excessive
value attached to mere attendance at the synagogue would rapidly grow in
public estimation, till it exceeded all bounds of moderation or reason.
Thus, such Scriptural sayings as Isaiah 66:20, 55:6 and Psalm 82:1 were
applied to it.

The Babylon Talmud goes even farther. There we are told (Ber. 6 a), that
the prayer which a man addresses to God has only its proper effect if
offered in the synagogue; that if an individual, accustomed to frequent
every day the synagogue, misses it for once, God will demand an account
of him; that if the Eternal finds fewer than ten persons there gathered,
His anger is kindled, as it is written in Isaiah 50:2 (Ber. 6 b); that
if a person has a synagogue in his own town, and does not enter it for
prayer, he is to be called an evil neighbour, and provokes exile alike
upon himself and his children, as it is written in Jeremiah 12:4; while,
on the other hand, the practice of early resorting to the synagogue
would account for the longevity of people (Ber. 8 a).

Putting aside these extravagances, there cannot, however, be doubt that,
long before the Talmudical period, the institution of synagogues had
spread, not only among the Palestinian, but among the Jews of the
dispersion, and that it was felt a growing necessity, alike from
internal and external causes.

Readers of the New Testament know, that at the time of our Lord
synagogues were dotted all over the land; that in them “from of old”
Moses had been read (Acts 15:21); that they were under the rule of
certain authorities, who also exercised discipline; that the services
were definitely regulated, although considerable liberty obtained, and
that part of them consisted in reading the prophets, which was generally
followed by an “exhortation” (Acts 13:15) or an address (Luke 4:17).

The word “synagogue” is, of course, of Greek derivation, and means
“gathering together”–for religious purposes. The corresponding
Rabbinical terms, “chenisah,” “cheneseth,” etc., “zibbur,” “vaad,” and
“kahal,” may be generally characterised as equivalents. But it is
interesting to notice, that both the Old Testament and the Rabbis have
shades of distinction, well known in modern theological discussions. To
begin with the former. Two terms are used for Israel as a congregation:
“edah” and “kahal”; of which the former seems to refer to Israel chiefly
in their outward organisation as a congregation–what moderns would call
the visible Church–while “kahal” rather indicates their inner or
spiritual connection.

Even the LXX seem to have seen this distinction. The word “edah” occurs
one hundred and thirty times, and is always rendered in the LXX by
“synagogue,” never by “ecclesia” (church); while “kahal” is translated
in seventy places by “ecclesia,” and only in thirty-seven by
“synagogue.” Similarly, the Mishnah employs the term “kahal” only to
denote Israel as a whole; while the term “zibbur,” for example, is used
alike for churches and for the Church–that is, for individual
congregations, and for Israel as a whole.

The origin of the synagogue is lost in the obscurity of tradition. Of
course, like so many other institutions, it is traced by the Rabbis to
the patriarchs. Thus, both the Targum Jonathan and the Jerusalem Targum
represent Jacob as an attendant in the synagogue, and Rebekah as
resorting thither for advice when feeling within her the unnatural
contest of her two sons. There can be no occasion for seriously
discussing such statements. For when in 2 Kings 22:8 we read that “the
book of the law” was discovered by Shaphan the scribe in “the house of
the Lord,” this implies that during the reign of King Josiah there could
have been no synagogues in the land, since it was their main object to
secure the weekly reading, and of course the preservation, of the books
of Moses (Acts 15:21).

Our Authorised Version, indeed, renders Psalm 74:8, “They have burned up
all the synagogues of God in the land.” But there is good authority for
questioning this translation; and, even if admitted, it would not settle
the question of the exact time when synagogues originated. On the other
hand, there is not a hint of synagogue-worship either in the law or the
prophets; and this of itself would be decisive, considering the
importance of the subject. Besides, it may be said that there was no
room for such meetings under the Old Testament dispensation. There the
whole worship was typical–the sacrificial services alike constituting
the manner in which Israel approached unto God, and being the way by
which He communicated blessings to His people.

Gatherings for prayer and for fellowship with the Father belong, so far
as the Church as a whole is concerned, to the dispensation of the Holy
Spirit. It is quite in accordance with this general principle, that when
men filled with the Spirit of God were raised up from time to time,
those who longed for deeper knowledge and closer converse with the Lord
should have gathered around them on Sabbaths and new moons, as the pious
Shunammite resorted to Elisha (2 Kings 4:23), and as others were no
doubt wont to do, if within reach of “prophets” or their disciples. But
quite a different state of matter ensued during the Babylonish
captivity.

Deprived of the Temple services, some kind of religious meetings would
become an absolute necessity, if the people were not to lapse into
practical heathenism–a danger, indeed, which, despite the admonitions of
the prophets, and the prospect of deliverance held out, was not quite
avoided. For the preservation, also, of the national bond which
connected Israel, as well as for their continued religious existence,
the institution of synagogues seemed alike needful and desirable. In
point of fact, the attentive reader of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah
will discover in the period after the return from Babylon the beginnings
of the synagogue.

Only quite rudimentary as yet, and chiefly for the purposes of
instructing those who had come back ignorant and semi-heathenish–still,
they formed a starting-point. Then came the time of terrible Syrian
oppression and persecutions, and of the Maccabean rising. We can
understand, how under such circumstances the institution of the
synagogue would develop, and gradually assume the proportions and the
meaning which it afterwards attained. For it must be borne in mind,
that, in proportion as the spiritual import of the Temple services was
lost to view, and Judaism became a matter of outward ordinances, nice
distinctions, and logical discussion, the synagogue would grow in
importance.

And so it came to pass, that at the time of Christ there was not a
foreign settlement of Jews without one or more synagogues–that of
Alexandria, of which both the Talmuds speak in such exaggerated
language, being specially gorgeous–while throughout Palestine they were
thickly planted. It is to these latter only that we can for the present
direct attention.

Not a town, nor a village, if it numbered only ten men, who could or
would wholly give themselves to divine things, but had one or more
synagogues.

If it be asked, why the number ten was thus fixed upon as the smallest
that could form a congregation, the reply is that, according to Numbers
14:27, the “evil congregation” consisted of the spies who had brought a
bad report, and whose number was ten–after deducting, of course, Joshua
and Caleb. Larger cities had several, some of them many, synagogues.
From Acts 6:9 we know that such was the case in Jerusalem, tradition
having also left us an account of the synagogue of “the Alexandrians,”
to which class of Jews Stephen may have belonged by birth or education,
on which ground also he would chiefly address himself to them.

The Rabbis have it that, at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem,
that city had not fewer than 480, or at least 460, synagogues. Unless
the number 480 was fixed upon simply as the multiple of symbolical
numbers (4 x 10 x 12), or with a kindred mystical purpose in view, it
would, of course, be a gross exaggeration. But, as a stranger entered a
town or village, it could never be difficult to find out the synagogue.
If it had not, like our churches, its spire, pointing men, as it were,
heavenward, the highest ground in the place was at least selected for
it, to symbolise that its engagements overtopped all things else, and in
remembrance of the prophetic saying, that the Lord’s house should “be
established in the top of the mountains,” and “exalted above the hills”
(Isa 2:2).

If such a situation could not be secured, it was sought to place it “in
the corners of streets,” or at the entrance to the chief squares,
according to what was regarded as a significant direction in Proverbs
1:21. Possibly our Lord may have had this also in view when He spoke of
those who loved “to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners
of the streets” (Matt 6:5), it being a very common practice at the time
to offer prayer on entering a synagogue. But if no prominent site could
be obtained, a pole should at least be attached to the roof, to reach up
beyond the highest house. A city whose synagogue was lower than the
other dwellings was regarded as in danger of destruction.

Of the architecture of ordinary synagogues, not only the oldest still in
existence, but the recent excavations in Palestine, enable us to form a
correct idea. Internally they were simply rectangular or round
buildings, with a single or double colonnade, and more or less adorned
by carvings. Externally they had generally some sacred symbol carved on
the lintels–commonly the seven-branched candlestick, or perhaps the pot
of manna. <sup>**[<sup>59</sup>](#sdfootnote59sym)**</sup>

There is one remarkable instance of the use of the latter emblem, too
important to be passed over. In Capernaum, our Lord’s “own city” (Matt
9:1), there was but one synagogue–that built at the cost of the pious
centurion. For, although our Authorised Version renders the commendation
of the Jewish elders, “He loveth our nation, and has built us a
synagogue” (Luke 7:5), in the original the article is definite: “he hath
built us the synagogue”–just as in a similar manner we infer that
Nazareth had only one synagogue (Matt 13:54).

The site of the ancient Capernaum had till comparatively recently been
unknown. But its identification with the modern Tell Hum is now so
satisfactory, that few would care to question it. What is even more
interesting, the very ruins of that synagogue which the good centurion
built have been brought to light; and, as if to make doubt impossible,
its architecture is evidently that of the Herodian period. And here
comes in the incidental but complete confirmation of the gospel
narrative. We remember how, before, the Lord Jesus had by His word of
blessing multiplied the scanty provision, brought, it might be
accidentally, by a lad in the company of those five thousand who had
thronged to hear Him, so that there was not only sufficient for their
wants, but enough for each of the twelve apostles to fill his basket
with the fragments of what the Savior had dispensed.

That day of miraculous provision had been followed by a night of equally
wondrous deliverance. His disciples were crossing the lake, now tossed
by one of those sudden storms which so frequently sweep down upon it
from the mountains. All at once, in their perplexity, it was the Master
Whom they saw, walking on the sea, and nearing the ship. As the light of
the moon fell upon that well-known form, and, as He drew nigh, cast His
shadow in increasing proportions upon the waters which, obedient, bore
His feet, they feared. It was a marvelous vision–too marvelous almost to
believe it a reality, and too awful to bear it, if a reality. And so
they seem to have hesitated about receiving Him into the ship.

But His presence and voice soon reassured them, and “immediately the
ship was at the land.” That “land” was the seashore of Capernaum. The
next morning broke with the usual calm and beauty of spring on the lake.
Presently white sails were spreading over its tranquil waters; marking
the approach of many from the other side, who, missing “the Prophet,”
Whom, with the characteristic enthusiasm of the inhabitants of that
district, they would fain have made a king, now followed Him across the
water.

There could be no difficulty in “finding Him” in “His own city,” the
home of Peter and Andrew (Mark 1:21,29). But no ordinary dwelling would
have held such a concourse as now thronged around Him. So, we imagine,
the multitude made their way towards the synagogue. On the road, we
suppose, the question and answers passed, of which we have an account in
John 6:25-28. They had now reached the entrance to the synagogue; and
the following discourse was pronounced by the Lord in the synagogue
itself, as we are expressly told in verse 59: “These things said He in
the synagogue, as He taught in Capernaum.” But what is so remarkable is,
that the very lintel of this synagogue has been found, and that the
device upon it bears such close reference to the question which the Jews
put to Jesus, that we can almost imagine them pointing up to it, as they
entered the synagogue, and said: “Our fathers did eat manna in the
desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat” (John
6:31).

For, in the words of Canon Williams, “The lintel lying among the ruins
of the good centurion’s synagogue at Capernaum has carved on it the
device of the pot of manna. What is further remarkable, this lintel is
ornamented besides with a flowing pattern of vine leaves and clusters of
grapes, and another emblem of the mystery of which our Lord discoursed
so largely in this synagogue.”

Before parting from this most interesting subject, we may place beside
the Master, as it were, the two representatives of His Church, a Gentile
and a Jew, both connected with this synagogue. Of its builder, the good
centurion, Canon Williams thus writes: “In what spirit the large-hearted
Roman soldier had made his offering, the rich and elaborate carvings of
cornices and entablatures, of columns and capitals, and niches, still
attest.” As for the ruler of that same synagogue, we know that it was
Jairus, whose cry of anguish and of faith brought Jesus to his house to
speak the life-giving “Talitha cumi” over the one only daughter, just
bursting into womanhood, who lay dead in that chamber, while the crowd
outside and the hired minstrels made shrill, discordant mourning.

Thus far as to the external appearance of synagogues. Their internal
arrangement appears to have been originally upon the plan of the Temple,
or, perhaps, even of the Tabernacle. At least, the oldest still standing
synagogue, that of the Cyrenian Jews, in the island of Gerbe, is,
according to the description of a missionary, Dr. Ewald, tripartite,
after the model of the Court, the Holy, and the Most Holy Place.

And in all synagogues the body of the building, with the space around,
set apart for women, represents the Court of the Women, while the
innermost and highest place, with the Ark behind, containing the rolls
of the law, represents the sanctuary itself. In turn the synagogue seems
to have been adopted as the model for the earliest Christian churches.
Hence not only the structure of the “basilica,” but the very term
“bema,” is incorporated in Rabbinical language. This is only what might
have been expected, considering that the earliest Christians were Jews
by nationality, and that heathenism could offer no type for Christian
worship. To return.

As concerned the worshippers, it was deemed wrong to pray behind a
synagogue without turning the face to it; and a story is told (Ber. 6 b)
of Elijah appearing in the form of an Arab merchant, and punishing one
guilty of this sin. “Thou standest before thy Master as if there were
two Powers [or Gods],” said the seeming Arab; and with these words “he
drew his sword and killed him.” A still more curious idea prevailed,
that it was requisite to advance the length of at least “two doors”
within a synagogue before settling to prayer, which was justified by a
reference to Proverbs 8:34 (Ber. 8 a).

The inference is peculiar, but not more so, perhaps, than those of some
modern critics, and certainly not more strange than that of the Talmud
itself, which, on a preceding page, when discussing the precise duration
of the wrath of the Almighty, concludes that Balaam had been the only
person who knew it exactly, since it is written of him (Num 24:16), that
he “knew the thoughts of the Most High!” Another direction of the Talmud
was to leave the synagogue with slow steps, but to hasten to it as
rapidly as possible, since it was written (Hosea 6:3, as the Rabbis
arranged the verse), “Let us pursue to know the Lord.”

Rabbi Seira tells us how, at one time, he had been scandalized by seeing
the Rabbis running on the Sabbath–when bodily rest was enjoined–to
attend a sermon; but that, when he understood how Hosea 11:10 applied to
the teaching of the Halakhah, he himself joined in their race. And so
Rabbi Seira, as it seems to us, somewhat caustically concludes: “The
reward of a discourse is the haste” with which people run to it–no
matter, it would appear, whether they get in to hear it, or whether
there is anything in the discourse worth the hearing.

As a rule, synagogues were built at the expense of the congregation,
though perhaps assisted by richer neighbours. Sometimes, as we know,
they were erected at the cost of private individuals, which was supposed
to involve special merit. In other cases, more particularly when the
number of Jews was small, a large room in a private house was set apart
for the purpose. This also passed into the early Church, as we gather
from Acts 2:46, 5:42. Accordingly we understand the apostolic
expression, “Church in the house” (Rom 16:3,5; 1 Cor 16:19; Col 4:15;
Phile 2), as implying that in all these and other instances a room in a
private house had been set apart, in which the Christians regularly
assembled for their worship.

Synagogues were consecrated by prayer, although, even thus, the ceremony
was not deemed completed till after the ordinary prayers had been
offered by some one, though it were a passing stranger. Rules of
decorum, analogous to those enforced in the Temple, were enjoined on
those who attended the synagogue. Decency and cleanliness in dress,
quietness and reverence in demeanour, are prescribed with almost
wearisome details and distinctions. Money collections were only to be
made for the poor or for the redemption of captives.

If the building were in a dangerous condition, the synagogue might be
broken down, provided another were built as rapidly as possible in its
place. But even so, the sanctity of their place remained, and
synagogue-ruins might not be converted into mourning places, nor used as
thoroughfares, nor might ropes be hung up in them, nor nets spread, nor
fruits laid out for drying. The principle of sanctity applied, of
course, to all analogous uses to which such ruins might have been put.
Money collected for building a synagogue might, if absolute necessity
arose, be employed by the congregation for other purposes; but if
stones, beams, etc., had been purchased for the building, these could
not be resold, but were regarded as dedicated.

A town synagogue was considered absolutely inalienable; those in
villages might be disposed of under the direction of the local
Sanhedrim, provided the locale were not afterwards to be used as a
public bath, a wash-house, a tannery, or a pool. The money realised was
to be devoted to something more sacred than the mere stone and mortar of
a synagogue–say, the ark in which the copies of the law were kept.
Different from synagogues, though devoted to kindred purposes, were the
so-called “oratories” or “places where prayer was wont to be made” (Acts
16:13). These were generally placed outside towns and in the vicinity of
running water or of the sea (Josephus, Ant. xiv, 256-258), for the
purpose of the customary lustrations connected with prayer (Philo ii.
535).

The separation of the sexes, which was observed even in the Temple at
the time of Christ, was strictly carried out in the synagogues, such
division being made effectual by a partition, boarded off and provided
with gratings, to which there was separate access. The practice seems
simply in accordance with Eastern manners and modes of thinking. But the
Rabbis, who seek Scripture authority for every arrangement, however
trivial, find in this case their warrant in Zechariah 12:11-14, where
“the wives” are no less than five times spoken of as “apart,” while
engaged in their prayerful mourning.

The synagogue was so placed that, on entering it, the worshippers would
face towards Jerusalem–mere “orientation,” as it is now called, having
no meaning in Jewish worship. Beyond the middle of the synagogue rose
the platform or “bima,” as it was anciently, or “almmeor,” as it is
presently named. Those who were called up to it for reading ascended by
the side nearest, and descended by that most remote from their seats in
the synagogue. On this “bima” stood the pulpit, or rather lectern, the
“migdal ez,” “wooden tower” of Nehemiah 8:4, whence the prescribed
portions of the law and of the prophets were read, and addresses
delivered. The reader stood; the preacher sat.

Thus we find (Luke 4:20) that, after reading a portion from the prophet
Isaiah, our Lord “closed the book, and He gave it again to the minister,
and sat down,” before delivering His discourse in the synagogue of
Nazareth. Prayer also was offered standing, although in the Temple the
worshippers prostrated themselves, a practice still continued in certain
of the most solemn litanies. The pulpit or lectern–“migdal” (tower),
“chisse” and “churseja” (chair or throne), or “pergulah” (the Latin
“pergula,” probably elevation)–stood in the middle of the “bima,” and in
front of “the ark.”

The latter, which occupied the innermost place in the synagogue, as
already noticed, corresponded to the Most Holy Place in the Temple, and
formed the most important part. It was called the “aron” (ark), the
“tevah,” or “tevutha” (chest, like that in which Noah and Moses were
saved), or the “hechal” (little temple). In reality, it consisted of a
press or chest, in which the rolls of the law were deposited. This “ark”
was made movable (Taan. ii. 1,2), so as to lift out on occasions of
public fasting and prayer, in order to have it placed in the street or
market-place where the people gathered.

Sometimes there was also a second press for the rolls of the prophets,
in which the disused or damaged rolls of the law were likewise
deposited. In front of the ark hung the “vilon” (“velum,” veil), in
imitation of that before the Holy Place. Above it was suspended the “ner
olam,” or ever-burning lamp, and near to it stood the eight-branched
candlestick, lit during the eight days of the feast of the dedication of
the Temple (John 10:22), or Candlemas. The practice of lighting candles
and lamps, not merely for use, but in honour of the day or feast, is not
unknown in the synagogues.

Of course, in regard to this, as to other practices, it is impossible to
determine what was the exact custom at the time of our Lord, although
the reader may be able to infer how much and what special practices may
have been gradually introduced. It would lead beyond our present scope
to describe the various directions to be observed in copying out the
synagogue-rolls, which embodied the five books of Moses, or to detail
what would render them unfit for use.

No less than twenty such causes are mentioned by the Rabbis. At present
the vellum, on which the Pentateuch is written, is affixed to two
rollers, and as each portion of the law is read it is unrolled from the
right, and rolled on to the left roller. The roll itself was fastened
together by linen wrappers or cloths (“mitpachoth”), and then placed in
a “case” (“tik,” the Greek “theke”). All these articles are already
mentioned in the Mishnah.

Later practices need not here occupy our attention. Lastly, it should be
noted, that at first the people probably stood in the synagogues or sat
on the ground. But as the services became more protracted, sitting
accommodation had to be provided. The congregation sat facing the ark.
On the other hand, “the rulers of the synagogue,” Rabbis, distinguished
Pharisees, and others, who sought honour of men, claimed “the chief
seats,” which were placed with their backs to the ark, and facing the
worshippers.

These seats, which bear the same name as in the New Testament, were made
objects of special ambition (Matt 23:6), and rank, dignity, or seniority
entitled a Rabbi or other influential man to priority. Our Lord
expressly refers to this (Matt 23:6) as one of the characteristic
manifestations of Pharisaical pride. That both the same spirit and
practice had crept into some of the early churches, appears from the
warning of St. James (James 2:2,3) against an un-Christ-like “respect of
persons,” which would assign a place high up in “synagogues” of
Christians to the mere possession of “goodly apparel” or the wearing of
the “gold ring.”

Hitherto we have chiefly described the outward arrangements of the
synagogues. It will now be necessary, however rapidly in this place, to
sketch their various uses, their worship, and their officials, most of
which are also referred to in various parts of the New Testament.

Chapter 17. The Worship of the Synagogue
========================================

One of the most difficult questions in Jewish history is that connected
with the existence of a synagogue within the Temple. That such a
“synagogue” existed, and that its meeting-place was in “the hall of hewn
stones,” at the south-eastern angle of the court of the priest, cannot
be called in question, in face of the clear testimony of contemporary
witnesses. Considering that “the hall of hew stones” was also the
meeting-place for the great Sanhedrim, and that not only legal
decisions, but lectures and theological discussions formed part of their
occupation, we might be tempted to conjecture that the term “synagogue”
had been employed in its wider sense, since such buildings were
generally used throughout the country for this two-fold purpose as well
as for worship.

Of theological lectures and discussions in the Temple, we have an
instance on the occasion when our Lord was found by His parents “sitting
in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them
questions” (Luke 2:46). And it can scarcely be doubted, that this also
explains how the scribes and Pharisees could so frequently “come upon
Him,” while He taught in the Temple, with their difficult and entangling
questions, up to that rejoinder about the nature of the Messiah, with
which He finally silenced them: “If David then call Him Lord, how is He
his Son?” (Matt 22:45).

But in reference to the so-called “Temple-synagogue,” there is this
difficulty, that certain prayers and rites seem to have been connected
with it, which formed no part of the regular Temple services, and yet
were somehow engrafted upon them. We can therefore only conclude that
the growing change in the theological views of Israel, before and about
the time of Christ, made the Temple services alone appear insufficient.
The symbolical and typical elements which constituted the life and
centre of Temple worship had lost their spiritual meaning and attraction
to the majority of that generation, and their place was becoming
occupied by so-called teaching and outward performances. Thus the
worship of the letter took the place of that of the spirit, and Israel
was preparing to reject Christ for Pharisaism.

The synagogue was substituted for the Temple, and overshadowed it, even
within its walls, by an incongruous mixture of man-devised worship with
the God-ordained typical rites of the sanctuary. Thus, so far from the
“Temple-synagogue” being the model for those throughout the country, as
some writers maintain, it seems to us of later origin, and to have
borrowed many rites from the country synagogues, in which the people had
become accustomed to them.

The subject has a far deeper than merely historical interest. For the
presence of a synagogue within the Temple, or rather, as we prefer to
put it, the addition of synagogue-worship to that of the Temple, is
sadly symbolical. It is, so to speak, one of those terribly significant
utterances (by deed), in which Israel, all unconsciously, pronounced its
own doom, just as was this: “His blood be upon us and our children,” or
the cry for the release of Barabbas (the son of the father), who had
been condemned “for sedition” and “murder”–no doubt in connection with a
pseudo-Messianic rising against the Roman power–instead of the true Son
of the Father, who would indeed have “restored the kingdom to Israel.”

And yet there was nothing in the worship itself of the synagogue which
could have prevented either the Lord, or His apostles and early
followers, from attending it till the time of final separation had come.
Readers of the New Testament know what precious opportunities it offered
for making known the Gospel. Its services were, indeed, singularly
elastic. For the main object of the synagogue was the teaching of the
people. The very idea of its institution, before and at the time of
Ezra, explains and conveys this, and it is confirmed by the testimony of
Josephus (Ag. Apion, ii, 157-172).

But perhaps the ordinary reader of the New Testament may have failed to
notice, how prominently this element in the synagogue is brought out in
the gospel history. Yet the word “teaching” is used so frequently in
connection with our Lord’s appearance in the synagogue, that its lesson
is obvious (see Matt 4:23; Mark 1:21, 6:2; Luke 4:15, 6:6, 13:10; John
6:59, 18:20). The “teaching” part of the service consisted mainly in
reading a section from the law, with which the reading of a portion from
the prophets, and a sermon, or address, were conjoined. Of course, the
liturgical element could in such services never have been quite wanting,
and it soon acquired considerable importance. It consisted of prayer and
the pronouncing of the Aaronic blessing (Num 6:24-26) by priests–that
is, of course, not by Rabbis, who were merely teachers or doctors, but
by lineal descendants of the house of Aaron. There was no service of
“praise” in the synagogues.

Public worship <sup>**[<sup>60</sup>](#sdfootnote60sym)**</sup>
commenced on ordinary occasions with the so-called “Shema,” which was
preceded in the morning and evening by two “benedictions,” and succeeded
in the morning by one, and in the evening by two, benedictions; the
second being, strictly speaking, an evening prayer.

The “Shema” was a kind of “belief,” or “creed,” composed of these three
passages of Scripture: Deuteronomy 6:4-9, 11:13-21; Numbers 15:37-41.

It obtained its name from the initial word “shema”: “Hear, O Israel,” in
Deuteronomy 6:4. From the Mishnah (Ber. 1. 3) we learn, that this part
of the service existed already before the time of our Lord; and we are
told (Ber. iii. 3), that all males were bound to repeat this belief
twice every day; children and slaves, as well as women, being exempted
from the obligation. There can be no reasonable doubt on the subject, as
the Mishnah expressly mentions the three Scriptural sections of the
“Shema,” the number of benedictions before and after it, and even the
initial words of the closing benediction (Ber. ii. 2, i. 4; Tamid, v.
1). We have, therefore, here certain prayers which our Lord Himself had
not only heard, but in which He must have shared–to what extent will
appear in the sequel.

These prayers still exist in the synagogue, although with later
additions, which, happily, it is not difficult to eliminate. Before
transcribing them, it may be quoted as a mark of the value attached to
them, that it was lawful to say this and the other daily prayers–to
which we shall hereafter refer–and the “grace at meat,” not only in the
Hebrew, but in any other language, in order to secure a general
understanding of the service (Sotah, vii. 1). At the same time,
expressions are used which lead us to suppose that, while the liturgical
formulae connected with the “Shema” were fixed, there were local
variations, in the way of lengthening or shortening (Ber. i. 4). The
following are the “benedictions” before the “Shema,” in their original
form:

1. “Blessed be Thou, O Lord, King of the world, Who formest the light
and createst the darkness, Who makest peace and createst everything;
Who, in mercy, givest light to the earth and to those who dwell upon it,
and in Thy goodness day by day and every day renewest the works of
creation. Blessed be the Lord our God for the glory of His handiwork and
for the light-giving lights which He has made for His praise. Selah!
Blessed be the Lord our God, Who hath formed the lights.”
<sup>**[<sup>61</sup>](#sdfootnote61sym)**</sup>

2. “With great love hast Thou loved us, O Lord our God, and with much
overflowing pity hast Thou pitied us, our Father and our King. For the
sake of our fathers who trusted in Thee, and Thou taughtest them the
statutes of life, have mercy upon us and teach us. Enlighten our eyes in
Thy law; cause our hearts to cleave to Thy commandments; unite our
hearts to love and fear Thy name, and we shall not be put to shame,
world without end. For Thou art a God Who preparest salvation, and us
hast Thou chosen from among all nations and tongues, and hast in truth
brought us near to Thy great Name–Selah–that we may lovingly praise Thee
and Thy Oneness. Blessed be the Lord Who in love chose His people
Israel.”

After this followed the “Shema.” The Mishnah gives the following
beautiful explanation of the order in which the portions of Scripture of
which it is composed are arranged (Ber. ii. 2). The section Deuteronomy
6:4-9 is said to precede that in 11:13-21, so that we might “take upon
ourselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, and only after that the
yoke of the commandments.” Again: Deuteronomy 11:13-21 precedes Numbers
15:37-41, because the former applies, as it were, both night and day;
the latter only by day.

The reader cannot fail to observe the light cast by the teaching of the
Mishnah upon the gracious invitation of our Lord: “Come unto Me, all ye
that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke
upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye
shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is
light” (Matt 11:28-30). These words must indeed have had a special
significance to those who remembered the Rabbinic lesson as to the
relation between the kingdom of heaven and the commandments, and they
would now understand how by coming to the Saviour they would first take
upon them “the yoke of the kingdom of heaven,” and then that of “the
commandments,” finding this “yoke easy” and the “burden light.”

The prayer after the “Shema” was as follows:

“True it is, that Thou art Jehovah our God and the God of our fathers,
our King and the King of our fathers, our Saviour and the Saviour of our
fathers, our Creator, the Rock of our salvation, our Help and our
Deliverer. Thy Name is from everlasting, and there is no God beside
Thee. A new song did they that were delivered sing to Thy Name by the
seashore; together did all praise and own Thee King, and say, Jehovah
shall reign world without end! Blessed be the Lord Who saveth Israel!”

The anti-Sadducean views expressed in this prayer will strike the
student of that period, while he will also be much impressed with its
suitableness and beauty. The special prayer for the evening is of not
quite so old a date as the three just quoted. But as it is referred to
in the Mishnah, and is so apt and simple, we reproduce it, as follows:

“O Lord our God! cause us to lie down in peace, and raise us up again to
life, O our King! Spread over us the tabernacle of Thy peace; strengthen
us before Thee in Thy good counsel, and deliver us for Thy Name’s sake.
Be Thou for protection round about us; keep far from us the enemy, the
pestilence, the sword, famine, and affliction. Keep Satan from before
and from behind us, and hide us in the shadow of Thy wings, for Thou art
a God Who helpest and deliverest us; and Thou, O God, art a gracious and
merciful King. Keep Thou our going out and our coming in, for life and
for peace, from henceforth and for ever!” (To this prayer a further
addition was made at a later period.)

The “Shema” and its accompanying “benedictions” seem to have been said
in the synagogue at the lectern; whereas for the next series of prayers
the leader of the devotions went forward and stood before “the ark.”
Hence the expression, “to go up before the ark,” for leading in prayer.
This difference in position seems implied in many passages of the
Mishnah (specially Megillah, iv.), which makes a distinction between
saying the “Shema” and “going up before the ark.”

The prayers offered before the ark consisted of the so-called eighteen
eulogies, or benedictions, and formed the “tephillah,” or supplication,
in the strictest sense of the term. These eighteen, or rather, as they
are now, nineteen, eulogies are of various dates–the earliest being the
first three and the last three. There can be no reasonable doubt that
these were said at worship in the synagogues, when our Lord was present.
Next in date are eulogies 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 16. Eulogy 7, which in its
present position seems somewhat incongruous, dates from a period of
great national calamity–perhaps the time of Pompey. The other eulogies,
and some insertions in the older benedictions, were added after the fall
of the Jewish commonwealth–eulogy 12 especially being intended against
the early Jewish converts to Christianity.

In all likelihood it had been the practice originally to insert prayers
of private composition between the (present) first three and last three
eulogies; and out of these the later eulogies were gradually formulated.
At any rate, we know that on Sabbaths and on other festive occasions
only the first three and the last three eulogies were repeated, other
petitions being inserted between them. There was thus room for the
endless repetitions and “long prayers” which the Saviour condemned (Mark
12:40; Luke 20:47).

Besides, it must be borne in mind that, both on entering and leaving the
synagogue, it was customary to offer prayer, and that it was a current
Rabbinical saying, “Prolix prayer prolongeth life.” But as we are sure
that, on the Sabbaths when Our Lord attended the synagogues at Nazareth
and Capernaum, the first three and the last three of the eulogies were
repeated, we produce them here, as follows:

1. “Blessed be the Lord our God and the God of our fathers, the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; the great, the mighty,
and the terrible God; the Most High God, Who showeth mercy and kindness,
Who createth all things, Who remembereth the gracious promises to the
fathers, and bringeth a Saviour to their children’s children, for His
own Name’s sake, in love. O King, Helper, Saviour, and Shield! Blessed
art Thou, O Jehovah, the Shield of Abraham.”

2. “Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever; Thou, Who quickenest the dead,
art mighty to save. In Thy mercy Thou preservest the living; Thou
quickenest the dead; in Thine abundant pity Thou bearest up those who
fall, and healest those who are diseased, and loosest those who are
bound, and fulfillest Thy faithful word to those who sleep in the dust.
Who is like unto Thee, Lord of strength, and who can be compared to
Thee, Who killest and makest alive, and causest salvation to spring
forth? And faithful art Thou to give life unto the dead. Blessed be
Thou, Jehovah, Who quickenest the dead!”

3. “Thou art holy, and Thy Name is holy; and the holy ones praise Thee
every day. Selah! Blessed art Thou, Jehovah God, the Holy One!”

It is impossible not to feel the solemnity of these prayers. They
breathe the deepest hopes of Israel in simple, Scriptural language. But
who can fully realise their sacred import as uttered not only in the
Presence, but by the very lips of the Lord Jesus Christ, Who Himself was
their answer?

The three concluding eulogies were as follows:

“Take gracious pleasure, O Jehovah our God, in Thy people Israel, and in
their prayers. Accept the burnt-offerings of Israel, and their prayers,
with thy good pleasure; and may the services of Thy people Israel be
ever acceptable unto Thee. And oh that our eyes may see it, as Thou
turnest in mercy to Zion! Blessed be Thou, O Jehovah, Who restoreth His
Shechinah to Zion!”

“We praise Thee, because Thou art Jehovah our God, and the God of our
fathers, for ever and ever. Thou art the Rock of our life, the Shield of
our salvation, from generation to generation. We laud Thee, and declare
Thy praise for our lives which are kept within Thine hand, and for our
souls which are committed unto Thee, and for Thy wonders which are with
us every day, and Thy wondrous deeds and Thy goodnesses, which are at
all seasons–evening, morning, and mid-day. Thou gracious One, Whose
compassions never end; Thou pitying One, Whose grace never ceaseth–for
ever do we put our trust in Thee! And for all this Thy Name, O our King,
be blessed and extolled always, for ever and ever! And all living bless
Thee–Selah–and praise Thy Name in truth, O God, our Salvation and our
Help. Blessed art Thou, Jehovah; Thy Name is the gracious One, to Whom
praise is due.”

(We give this eulogy in its shorter form, as it is at present used in
evening prayer.) “Oh bestow on Thy people Israel great peace, for ever;
for Thou art King and Lord of all peace, and it is good in Thine eyes to
bless Thy people Israel with praise at all times and in every hour.
Blessed art Thou, Jehovah, Who blesseth His people Israel with peace.”

Another act, hitherto, so far as we know, unnoticed, requires here to be
mentioned. It invests the prayers just quoted with a new and almost
unparalleled interest. According to the Mishnah (Megillah, iv. 5), the
person who read in the synagogue the portion from the prophets was also
expected to say the “Shema,” and to offer the prayers which have just
been quoted. It follows that, in all likelihood, our Lord Himself had
led the devotions in the synagogue of Capernaum on that Sabbath when He
read the portion from the prophecies of Isaiah which was that day
“fulfilled in their hearing” (Luke 4:16-21). Nor is it possible to
withstand the impression, how specially suitable to the occasion would
have been the words of these prayers, particularly those of eulogies 2
and 17.

The prayers were conducted or repeated aloud by one individual,
specially deputed for the occasion, the congregation responding by an
“Amen.” The liturgical service concluded with the priestly benediction
(Num 6:23,24), spoken by the descendants of Aaron. In case none such
were present, “the legate of the Church,” as the leader of the devotions
was called, repeated the words from the Scriptures in their connection.
In giving the benediction, the priests elevated their hands up to the
shoulders (Sotah, vii. 6); in the Temple, up to the forehead. Hence this
rite is designated by the expression, “the lifting up of the hands.”
<sup>**[<sup>62</sup>](#sdfootnote62sym)**</sup>

According to the present practice, the fingers of the two hands are so
joined together and separated as to form five interstices; and a mystic
meaning attaches to this. It was a later superstition to forbid looking
at the priests’ hands, as involving physical danger. But the Mishnah
already directs that priests having blemishes on their hands, or their
fingers dyed, were not to pronounce the benediction,

lest the attention of the people should be attracted. Of the attitude to
be observed in prayer, this is perhaps scarcely the place to speak in
detail. Suffice it, that the body was to be fully bent, yet so, that
care was taken never to make it appear as if the service had been
burdensome.

One of the Rabbis tells us, that, with this object in view, he bent down
as does a branch; while, in lifting himself up again, he did it like a
serpent–beginning with the head! Any one deputed by the rulers of a
congregation might say prayers, except a minor. This, however, applies
only to the “Shema.” The eulogies or “tephillah” proper, as well as the
priestly benediction, could not be pronounced by those who were not
properly clothed, nor by those who were so blind as not to be able to
discern daylight. If any one introduced into the prayers heretical
views, or what were regarded as such, he was immediately stopped; and,
if any impropriety had been committed, was put under the ban for a week.

One of the most interesting and difficult questions relates to certain
modes of dress and appearance, and certain expressions used in prayer,
which the Mishnah (Megillah, iv. 8,9) declares either to mark heresy or
to indicate that a man was not to be allowed to lead prayers in the
synagogue. It may be, that some of these statements refer not only to
certain Jewish “heretics,” but also to the early Jewish Christians. If
so, they may indicate certain peculiarities with which they were
popularly credited.

Of the services hitherto noticed, the most important were the repetition
of the eulogies and the priestly benediction. What now followed was
regarded as quite as solemn, if, indeed, not more so. It has already
been pointed out, that the main object of the synagogue was the teaching
of the people. This was specially accomplished by the reading of the
law. At present the Pentateuch is for this purpose arranged into
fifty-four sections, of which one is read on each successive Sabbath of
the year, beginning immediately after the feast of Tabernacles. But
anciently the lectionary, at least in Palestine, seems to have been
differently arranged, and the Pentateuch so divided that its reading
occupied three, or, according to some, three and a-half years (half a
Jubilee-period). The section for the day was subdivided, so that every
Sabbath at least seven persons were called up to read, each a portion,
which was to consist of not less than three verses.

The first reader began, and the last closed, with a benediction. As the
Hebrew had given place to the Aramaic, a “meturgeman,” or interpreter,
stood by the side of the reader, and translated verse by verse into the
vernacular. It was customary to have service in the synagogues, not only
on Sabbaths and feast-days, but also on the second and fifth days of the
week (Monday and Thursday), when the country-people came to market, and
when the local Sanhedrim also sat for the adjudication of minor causes.

At such week-day services only three persons were called up to read in
the law; on new moon’s day and on the intermediate days of a festive
week, four; on festive days–when a section from the prophets was also
read–five; and on the day of atonement, six. Even a minor was allowed to
read, and, if qualified, to act as “meturgeman.” The section describing
the sin of Reuben, and that giving a second account of the sin of the
golden calf, were read, but not interpreted; those recounting the
priestly blessing, and, again, the sin of David and of Amnon, were
neither read nor interpreted. The reading of the law was followed by a
lesson from the prophets.

At present there is a regular lectionary, in which these lessons are so
selected as to suit the sections from the law appointed for the day.
This arrangement has been traced to the time of the Syrian persecutions,
when all copies of the law were sought for and destroyed; and the Jewish
authorities are supposed to have selected portions from the prophets to
replace those from the law which might not be produced in public. But it
is evident that, if these persecuting measures had been rigidly
enforced, the sacred rolls of the prophets would not have escaped
destruction any more than those of the law.

Besides, it is quite certain that such a lectionary of the prophets as
that presently in use did not exist at the time of our Lord, nor even
when the Mishnah was collated. Considerable liberty seems to have been
left to individuals; and the expression used by St. Luke in reference to
our Lord in the synagogue at Capernaum (Luke 4:17), “And when He had
opened the book, He found the place where it was written,” most
accurately describes the state of matters. For, from Megillah iv. 4, we
gather that, in reading from the prophets, it was lawful to pass over
one or more verses, provided there were no pause between the reading and
the translation of the “meturgeman.”

For here also the services of a “meturgeman” were employed; only that he
did not, as in reading the law, translate verse by verse, but after
every three verses. It is a remarkable fact that the Rabbis exclude from
public reading the section in the prophecies of Ezekiel which describes
“the chariot and wheels.” Rabbi Elieser would also have excluded that in
Ezekiel 16:2.

The reading of the prophets was often followed by a sermon or address,
with which the service concluded. The preacher was called “darshan,” and
his address a “derashah” (homily, sermon, from “darash,” to ask,
inquire, or discuss). When the address was a learned theological
discussion–especially in academies– it was not delivered to the people
directly, but whispered into the ear of an “amora,” or speaker, who
explained to the multitude in popular language the weighty sayings which
the Rabbi had briefly communicated to him.

A more popular sermon, on the other hand, was called a “meamar,”
literally, a “speech, or talk.” These addresses would be either
Rabbinical expositions of Scripture, or else doctrinal discussions, in
which appeal would be made to tradition and to the authority of certain
great teachers. For it was laid down as a principle (Eduj. i. 3), that
“every one is bound to teach in the very language of his teacher.”

In view of this two-fold fact, we can in some measure understand the
deep impression which the words of our Lord produced, even on those who
remained permanently uninfluenced by them. The substance of His
addresses was far other than they had ever heard of, or conceived
possible. It seemed as if they opened quite a new world of thought,
hope, duty, and comfort. No wonder that even in contemptuous Capernaum
“all bare Him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which
proceeded out of His mouth”; and that the very Temple-guard sent to make
Him prisoner were overawed, and before the council could only give this
account of their strange negligence: “Never man spake like this man”
(John 7:46).

Similarly, the form also of His teaching was so different from the
constant appeal of the Rabbis to mere tradition; it seemed all to come
so quite fresh and direct from heaven, like the living waters of the
Holy Spirit, that “the people were astonished at His doctrine: for He
taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes” (Matt
7:28,29).

Chapter 18. Brief Outline of Ancient Jewish Theological Literature
==================================================================

The arrangements of the synagogue, as hitherto described, combined in a
remarkable manner fixedness of order with liberty of the individual.
Alike the seasons and the time of public services, their order, the
prayers to be offered, and the portions of the law to be read were
fixed. On the other hand, between the eighteen “benedictions” said on
ordinary days, and the seven repeated on the Sabbaths, free prayer might
be inserted; the selection from the prophets, with which the public
reading concluded–the “Haphtarah” (from “patar,” to “conclude”)–seems to
have been originally left to individual choice; while the determination
who was to read, or to conduct the prayers, or to address the people,
was in the hands of the “rulers of the synagogue” (Acts 13:15).

The latter, who were probably also the members of the local Sanhedrin,
had naturally charge of the conduct of public worship, as well as of the
government and discipline of the synagogues. They were men learned in
the law and of good repute, whom the popular voice designated, but who
were regularly set apart by “the laying on of hands,” or the “Semichah,”
which was done by at least three, who had themselves received
ordination, upon which the candidate had the formal title of Rabbi
bestowed on him, and was declared qualified to administer the law (Sanh.
13 b). The Divine Majesty was supposed to be in the midst of each
Sanhedrin, on account of which even that consisting of only three
members might be designated as “Elohim.” Perhaps this may have been said
in explanation and application of Psalm 82:6: “I have said, Ye are
Elohim; and all of you children of the Most High.”

The special qualifications for the office of Sanhedrist, mentioned in
Rabbinical writings, are such as to remind us of the directions of St.
Paul to Timothy (1 Tim 3:1-10). A member of the Sanhedrin must be wise,
modest, God-fearing, truthful, not greedy of filthy lucre, given to
hospitality, kindly, not a gambler, nor a usurer, nor one who traded in
the produce of Sabbatical years, nor yet one who indulged in unlawful
games (Sanh. iii. 3). They were called “Sekenim,” “elders” (Luke 7:3),
“Memunim,” “rulers” (Mark 5:22), “Parnasin,” “feeders, overseers,
shepherds of the flock” (Acts 20:28; 1 Peter 5:2), and “Manhigei,”
“guides” (Heb 13:7).

They were under the presidency and supreme rule of an “Archisynagogos,”
or “Rosh-ha-Cheneseth,” “head of the synagogue” (Yom. vii. 1; Sot. vii.
7), who sometimes seems to have even exercised sole authority. The
designation occurs frequently in the New Testament (Matt 9:18; Mark
5:35,36,38; Luke 8:41,49, 13:14; Acts 18:8,17). The inferior functions
in the synagogue devolved on the “chassan,” or “minister” (Luke 4:20).
In course of time, however, the “chassanim” combined with their original
duties the office of schoolmaster; and at present they lead both the
singing and the devotions of the synagogue. This duty originally
devolved not on any fixed person, but whoever was chosen might for the
time being act as “Sheliach Zibbur,” or “legate of the congregation.”
Most modern writers have imagined, that the expression “angel of the
Church,” in the epistles to the seven churches in the book of
Revelation, was used in allusion to this ancient arrangement of the
synagogue.

But the fact that the “Sheliach Zibbur” represented not an office but a
function, renders this view untenable. Besides, in that case, the
corresponding Greek expression would rather have been “apostle” than
“angel of the Church.” Possibly, however, the writer of the Epistle to
the Hebrews may refer to it, when he designates the Lord Jesus “the
Apostle and High-Priest of our profession” (Heb 3:1). Besides these
functionaries, we also read of “Gabaei Zedakah,” or collectors of
charity, to whom the Talmud (B. Bathra, 8 b) by a jeu de mots
<sup>**[<sup>63</sup>](#sdfootnote63sym)**</sup> applies the promise
that they “shall be as the stars for ever and ever” (Dan 12:3), since
they lead many to “righteousness.”

Alms were collected at regular times every week, either in money or in
victuals. At least two were employed in collecting, and three in
distributing charity, so as to avoid the suspicion of dishonesty or
partiality. These collectors of charity, who required to be “men of good
repute, and faithful,” are thought by many to have been the model for
the institution of the Diaconate in the early Church. But the analogy
scarcely holds good; nor, indeed, were such collectors employed in every
synagogue.

In describing the conduct of public worship in the synagogues, reference
was made to the “meturgeman,” who translated into the vernacular dialect
what was read out of the Hebrew Scriptures, and also to the “darshan,”
who expounded the Scriptures or else the traditional law in an address,
delivered after the reading of the “Haphtarah,” or section from the
prophets. These two terms will have suggested names which often occur in
writings on Jewish subjects, and may fitly lead to some remarks on
Jewish theology at the time of our Lord. Now the work of the
“meturgeman” was perpetuated in the Targum, and that of the “darshan” in
the Midrash.

Primarily the Targum, then, was intended as a translation of the Hebrew
Scriptures into the vernacular Aramaean. Of course, such translations
might be either literal, or else more or less paraphrastic. Every Targum
would also naturally represent the special views of the translator, and
be interesting as affording an insight into the ideas prevalent at the
time, and the manner in which Scripture was understood. But some
Targumim are much more paraphrastic than others, and indeed become a
kind of commentary, showing us the popular theology of the time.

Strictly speaking, we have really no Targum dating from the time of our
Lord, nor even from the first century of our era. There can be no doubt,
however, that such a Targum did exist, although it has been lost. Still,
the Targumim preserved to us, although collated, and having received
their present form at later periods, contain very much that dates from
the Temple-period, and even before that. Mentioning them in the order of
their comparative antiquity, we have the Targum of Onkelos, on the five
books of Moses; the Targum of Jonathan, on the prophets (inclusive of
Joshua, Judges, and the books of Samuel and of the Kings); the so-called
(or pseudo) Jonathan on the Pentateuch; and the Jerusalem Targum, which
is but a fragment. Probably the latter two were intended to be
supplemental to the Targum Onkelos. Late criticism has thrown doubt even
on the existence of such a person as Onkelos. Whoever may have been the
author, this Targum, in its present form, dates probably from the third,
that of Jonathan on the prophets from the fourth century.

In some respects more interesting than the Targumim are the Midrashim,
of which we possess three, dating probably, in their present form, from
the first or second century of our era, but embodying many parts much
older. These are–mentioning them again in the order of their
antiquity–“Siphra” (the book), a commentary on Leviticus; “Siphri,” a
commentary on Numbers and Deuteronomy; and “Mechiltha,” a commentary on
certain portions of Exodus.

But we have even a monument more interesting than these, of the views of
the ancient Pharisees, and of their Scriptural interpretations. Some of
the fathers referred to a work called “Lesser Genesis,” or the “Book of
Jubilees.” This had been lost to theological literature, till again
discovered within the present century, although not in the original
Hebrew, nor even in its first or Greek translation, but in an Ethiopic
rendering from the latter. The work, which no doubt dates from the era
of our Lord, covers the same ground as the first book of Moses, whence
the name of “Lesser Genesis.” It gives the Biblical narrative from the
creation of the world to the institution of the Passover, in the spirit
in which the Judaism of that period would view it.

The legendary additions, the Rabbinical ideas expressed, the
interpretations furnished, are just such as one would expect to find in
such a work. One of the main objects of the writer seems to have been
the chronology of the book of Genesis, which it is attempted to settle.
All events are recorded according to Jubilee-periods of forty-nine
years, whence the name “Book of Jubilees,” given to the work. These
“Jubilees” are again arranged into “weeks,” each of seven years (a day
for a year); and events are classified as having taken place in a
certain month of a certain year, of a certain “week” of years, of a
certain “Jubilee”-period. Another tendency of the book, which, however,
it has in common with all similar productions, is to trace up all later
institutions to the patriarchal period.
<sup>**[<sup>64</sup>](#sdfootnote64sym)**</sup>

Besides these works, another class of theological literature has been
preserved to us, around which of late much and most serious controversy
has gathered. Most readers, of course, know about the Apocrypha; but
these works are called the “pseudo-epigraphic writings.” Their
subject-matter may be described as mainly dealing with unfulfilled
prophecy; and they are couched in language and figures borrowed, among
others, from the book of Daniel. In fact, they read like attempts at
imitating certain portions of that prophecy–only that their scope is
sometimes wider.

This class of literature is larger than those not acquainted with the
period might have expected. Yet when remembering the troubles of the
time, the feverish expectations of a coming deliverance, and the
peculiar cast of mind and training of those who wrote them, they
scarcely seem more numerous, nor perhaps even more extravagant, than a
certain kind of prophetic literature, abundant among us not long ago,
which the fear of Napoleon or other political events from time to time
called forth. To that kind of production, they seem, at least to us, to
bear an essential likeness–only that, unlike the Western, the Oriental
expounder of unfulfilled prophecy assumes rather the language of the
prophet than that of the commentator, and clothes his views in mystic
emblematic language. In general, this kind of literature may be arranged
into Greek and Hebrew–according as the writers were either Egyptian
(Hellenistic) or Palestinian Jews. Considerable difficulty exists as to
the precise date of some of these writings–whether previous or
subsequent to the time of Christ.

These difficulties are, of course, increased when it is sought to fix
the precise period when each of them was composed. Still, late
historical investigations have led to much accord on general points.
Without referring to the use which opponents of Christianity have of
late attempted to make of these books, it may be safely asserted that
their proper study and interpretation will yet be made very helpful, not
only in casting light upon the period, but in showing the essential
difference between the teaching of the men of that age and that of the
New Testament. For each branch and department of sacred study, the more
carefully, diligently, and impartially it is pursued, affords only fresh
testimony to that truth which is most certainly, and on the best and
surest grounds, believed among us.

It were, however, a mistake to suppose that the Rabbinical views,
extravagant as they so often are, were propounded quite independently of
Scripture. On the contrary, every traditional ordinance, every
Rabbinical institution, nay, every legend and saying, is somehow foisted
upon the text of the Old Testament. To explain this, even in the
briefest manner, it is necessary to state that, in general, Jewish
traditionalism is distinguished into the “Halakhah” and the “Haggadah.”

The “Halakhah” (from “halach,” to “walk”) indicates the settled legal
determinations, which constituted the “oral law,” or “Thorah shebeal
peh.” Nothing could here be altered, nor was any freedom left to the
individual teacher, save that of explanation and illustration. The
object of the “Halakhah” was to state in detail, and to apply to all
possible cases, the principles laid down in the law of Moses; as also to
surround it, as it were, with “a hedge,” in order to render every
unwitting transgression impossible.

The “Halakhah” enjoyed not only the same authority with the law of
Moses, but, as being explanatory, in some respects was even more highly
esteemed. Indeed, strictly speaking, it was regarded as equally with the
Pentateuch the revelation of God to Moses; only the form or manner of
revelation was regarded as different–the one being committed to writing,
the other handed down by word of mouth. According to tradition, Moses
explained the traditional law successively to Aaron, to his sons, to the
seventy elders, and to the people–care being taken that each class heard
it four times (Maimonides’ Preface to Seraim, 1 a).

The Talmud itself attempts to prove that the whole traditional law, as
well as the writings of the prophets and the Hagiographa, had been
communicated to Moses, by quoting Exodus 24:12: “I will give thee tables
of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou
mayest teach them.” “The ‘tables of stone,’” argues Rabbi Levi (Ber. 5
1), “are the ten commandments; the ‘law’ is the written law (in the
Pentateuch); the ‘commandments’ are the Mishnah; ‘which I have written,’
refers to the prophets and the Hagiographa; while the words, ‘that thou
mayest teach them,’ point to the Gemara. From this we learn, that all
this was given to Moses on Sinai.”

If such was the “Halakhah,” it is not so easy to define the limits of
the “Haggadah.” The term, which is derived from the verb “higgid,” to
“discuss,” or “tell about,” covers all that possessed not the authority
of strict legal determinations. It was legend, or story, or moral, or
exposition, or discussion, or application–in short, whatever the fancy
or predilections of a teacher might choose to make it, so that he could
somehow connect it either with Scripture or with a “Halakhah.”

For this purpose some definite rules were necessary to preserve, if not
from extravagance, at least from utter absurdity. Originally there were
four such canons for connecting the “Haggadah” with Scripture.
Contracting, after the favorite manner of the Jews, the initial letters,
these four canons were designated by the word “Pardes” (Paradise). They
were:

1. To ascertain the plain meaning of a passage (the “Peshat”)

2. To take the single letters of a word as an indication or hint
(“Remes”) of other words, or even of whole sentences

3. The “Derush,” or practical exposition of a passage; and

4. To find out the “Sod” (mystery), or mystical meaning of a verse or
word.

These four canons were gradually enlarged into thirty-two rules, which
gave free vent to every kind of fancifulness. Thus one of these
rules–the “Gematria” (geometry, calculation)–allowed the interpreter to
find out the numerical value of the letters in a word–the Hebrew
letters, like the Roman, being also numerals–and to substitute for a
word one or more which had the same numerical value.

Thus, if in Numbers 12:1 we read that Moses was married to an “Ethiopian
woman” (in the original, “Cushith”), Onkelos substitutes instead of
this, by “gematria,” the words, “of fair appearance”–the numerical value
both of Cushith and of the words “of fair appearance” being equally 736.
By this substitution the objectionable idea of Moses’ marrying an
Ethiopian was at the same time removed. Similarly, the Mishnah maintains
that those who loved God were to inherit each 310 worlds, the numerical
value of the word “substance” (“Yesh”) in Proverbs 8:21 being 310. On
the other hand, the canons for the deduction of a “Halakhah” from the
text of Scripture were much more strict and logical. Seven such rules
are ascribed to Hillel, which were afterwards enlarged to thirteen.
<sup>**[<sup>65</sup>](#sdfootnote65sym)**</sup>

Little objection can be taken to them; but unfortunately their practical
application was generally almost as fanciful, and certainly as
erroneous, as in the case of the “Haggadah.”

Probably most readers would wish to know something more of those
“traditions” to which our Lord so often referred in His teaching. We
have here to distinguish, in the first place, between the Mishnah and
the Gemara. The former was, so to speak, the text, the latter its
extended commentary. At the same time, the Mishnah contains also a good
deal of commentary, and much that is not either legal determination or
the discussion thereof; while the Gemara, on the other hand, also
contains what we would call “text.”

The word Mishna (from the verb “shanah”) means “repetition”–the term
referring to the supposed repetition of the traditional law, which has
been above described. The Gemara, as the very word shows, means
“discussion,” and embodies the discussions, opinions, and saying of the
Rabbis upon, or a propos of, the Mishnah. Accordingly, the text of the
Mishnah is always given in the pages of the Talmud, which reproduce
those discussions thereon of the Jewish Theological parliament or
academy, which constitute the Gemara.

The authorities introduced in the Mishnah and the Gemara range from
about the year 180 BC to 430 AD (in the Babylon Talmud). The Mishnah is,
of course, the oldest work, and dates, in its present form and as a
written compilation, from the close of the second century of our era.
Its contents are chiefly “Halakhah,” there being only one Tractate
(Aboth) in which there is no “Halakhah” at all, and another (on the
measurements of the Temple) in which it but very rarely occurs. Yet
these two Tractates are of the greatest historical value and interest.

On the other hand, there are thirteen whole Tractates in the Mishnah
which have no “Haggadah” at all, and other twenty-two in which it is but
of rare occurrence. Very much of the Mishnah must be looked upon as
dating before, and especially from the time of Christ, and its
importance for the elucidation of the New Testament is very great,
though it requires to be most judiciously used.

The Gemara, or book of discussions on the Mishnah, forms the two
Talmuds–the Jerusalem and the Babylon Talmud. The former is so called
because it is the product of the Palestinian academies; the latter is
that of the Babylonian school. The completion of the Jerusalem or
Palestinian Talmud (“Talmud” = doctrine, lore) dates from the middle of
the fourth, that of the Babylonian from the middle of the sixth century
of our era. It need scarcely be said that the former is of much greater
historical value than the latter. Neither of these two Gemaras, as we
now possess them, is quite complete–that is, there are Tractates in the
Mishnah for which we have no Gemara, either in the Jerusalem or in the
Babylon Talmud. Lastly, the Babylon Talmud is more than four times the
size of that of Jerusalem. Obviously this is not the place for giving
even the briefest outline of the contents of the Mishnah.
<sup>**[<sup>66</sup>](#sdfootnote66sym)**</sup>

Suffice it here to state that it consists of six books (“sedarim,”
“orders”), which are subdivided into Tractates (“Massichthoth”), and
these again into chapters (“Perakim”), and single determinations or
traditions (“Mishnaioth”). In quoting the Mishnah it is customary to
mention not the Book (or “Seder”) but the special Tractate, the Perek
(or chapter), and the Mishnah. The names of these Tractates (not those
of the books) give a sufficient idea of their contents, which cover
every conceivable, and well-nigh every inconceivable case, with full
discussions thereon. Altogether the Mishnah contains sixty-three
Tractates, consisting of 525 chapters, and 4,187 “Mishnaioth.”

There is yet another branch of Jewish theology, which in some respects
is the most interesting to the Christian student. There can be no doubt,
that so early as the time of our Lord a series of doctrines and
speculations prevailed which were kept secret from the multitude, and
even from ordinary students, probably from fear of leading them into
heresy. This class of study bears the general name of the “Kabbalah,”
and, as even the term (from “kabal,” to “receive,” or “hand down”)
implies, represents the spiritual traditions handed down from earliest
times, although mixed up, in course of time, with many foreign and
spurious elements.

The “Kabbalah” grouped itself chiefly around the history of the
creation, and the mystery of God’s Presence and Kingdom in the world, as
symbolised in the vision of the chariot and of the wheels (Eze 1). Much
that is found in Cabalistic writings approximates so closely to the
higher truths of Christianity, that, despite the errors, superstitions,
and follies that mingle with it, we cannot fail to recognize the
continuance and the remains of those deeper facts of Divine revelation,
which must have formed the substance of prophetic teaching under the Old
Testament, and have been understood, or at least hoped for, by those who
were under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

If now, at the close of these sketches of Jewish life, we ask ourselves,
what might have been expected as to the relation between Christ and the
men and the religion of His period, the answer will not be difficult.
Assuredly, in one respect Christ could not have been a stranger to His
period, or else His teaching would have found no response, and, indeed,
have been wholly unintelligible to His contemporaries. Nor did He
address them as strangers to the covenant, like the heathen. His was in
every respect the continuation, the development, and the fulfillment of
the Old Testament.

Only, He removed the superincumbent load of traditionalism; He discarded
the externalism, the formalism, and the work-righteousness, which had
well-nigh obliterated the spiritual truths of the Old Testament, and
substituted in their place the worship of the letter. The grand
spiritual facts, which it embodied, He brought forward in all their
brightness and meaning; the typical teaching of that dispensation He
came to show forth and to fulfil; and its prophecies He accomplished,
alike for Israel and the world. And so in Him all that was in the Old
Testament–of truth, way, and life–became “Yea and Amen.” Thus we can
understand how, on the one hand, the Lord could avail Himself of every
spiritual element around, and adopt the sayings, parables, ideas, and
customs of that period–indeed, must have done so, in order to be a true
man of the period,–and yet be so wholly not of that time as to be
despised, rejected, and delivered up unto death by the blind guides of
His blinded fellow-countrymen.

Had He entirely discarded the period in which He lived, had He not
availed Himself of all in it that was true or might be useful, He would
not have been of it–not the true man Christ Jesus. Had He followed it,
identified Himself with its views and hopes, or headed its movements, He
would not have been the Christ, the Son of the living God, the promised
Deliverer from sin and guilt.

And so we can also perceive the reason of the essential enmity to Christ
on the part of the Pharisees and Scribes. It was not that He was a new
and a strange Teacher; it was, that He came as the Christ. Theirs was
not an opposition of teaching to His; it was a contrariety of
fundamental life-principles. “Light came into the world, but men loved
darkness rather than light.” Closely related as the two were, the
Pharisaical Judaism of that and of the present period is at the opposite
pole from the religion of Christ–alike as regards the need of man, the
purposes of God’s love, and the privileges of His children.

There was one truth which, we are reluctantly obliged to admit, found,
alas! scarcely any parallel in the teaching of Rabbinism: it was that of
a suffering Messiah. Hints indeed there were, as certain passages in the
prophecies of Isaiah could not be wholly ignored or misrepresented, even
by Rabbinical ingenuity, just as the doctrine of vicarious suffering and
substitution could not be eliminated from the practical teaching of the
confession of sins over the sacrifices, when the worshipper day by day
laid his hands upon, and transferred to them his guilt. Yet Judaism,
except in the case of the few, saw not in all this that to which alone
it could point as its real meaning: “The Lamb of God, which taketh away
the sin of the world.”

And now, as century after century has passed, and the gladsome Gospel
message has been carried from nation to nation, while Israel is still
left in the darkness of its unbelief and the misery of its mistaken
hope, we seem to realize with ever increasing force that “The people
that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the
land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.” Yes:
“unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the government
shall be upon His shoulder: and His Name shall be called Wonderful,
Counselor, The mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace”
(Isa 9:2,6). For assuredly, “God hath not cast away His people which He
foreknew.” But “all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall
come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from
Jacob” (Rom 11:2,26). “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of
the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night”
(Isa 21:11,12).

Appendix 1. Massecheth Middoth: Mishnah Tractate Describing the Measurements of the Temple
==========================================================================================

Middoth is the tenth Tractate of Seder V. (Kodashim) of the Mishnah. It
has no Gemara either in the Jerusalem or the Babylon Talmud. In the
former the whole of Seder V is awanting; in the latter only two and
a-half Tractates (half Tamid, Middoth, and Kinnim). Middoth contains
Halachah only in the following passages: i, 2, 3, 9; ii. 2, 4, 5, 6;
iii. 3, 5, 8; iv. 2, 5; v. 3, 4. Throughout the Mishnah the names of 128
sages are introduced. Of those mentioned in this Tractate almost all
witnessed the destruction of the Temple.

Perek I.

1. The priests kept watch in the Temple in three places: in the house
Avtinas, and in the house Nitsuts, and in the house of Moked; and the
Levites in twenty-one places: five at the five gates leading into the
Temple (the Mountain of the House), four in the four angles within, five
at the five gates of the court, four in its four angles without, and one
in the chamber of offering, and one in the chamber of the vail, and one
behind the Most Holy Place (the House of Atonement).

2. The Captain of the Temple (the man of the Temple Mount) visited each
guard, and burning torches were carried before him. And every guard
which did not stand up (which was not standing), the Captain of the
Temple said to him: “Peace be to thee.” If he observed that he slept, he
smote him with his stick, and he had authority to burn his dress. And
they said, “What is the noise (voice) in the court?” “It is the noise of
a Levite who is beaten, and his clothes are set on fire, because he
slept upon his watch.” Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Jacob, said: “On one
occasion they found the brother of my mother sleeping, and they burned
his dress.”

3. There were five gates to the Temple inclosure (Temple Mount): the two
gates of Huldah from the south, which served for entrance and for exit;
Kipponos from the west; Tadi from the north–it did not serve for
anything; the eastern gate, upon which was a representation of the city
of Shushan, and by it the high-priest who burned the Red Heifer, and all
who assisted, went out upon the Mount of Olives.

4. There were seven gates in the court; three on the north, and three on
the south, and one in the east. That in the south was the gate of
burning; second to it, the gate of the firstborn; third to it, the water
gate. That in the east was the gate of Nicanor, and two chambers
belonged to it, one on the right hand, and one on the left–the one the
chamber of Phineas, the wardrobe keeper, and the other the chamber of
those who made the pancake offering.
<sup>**[<sup>67</sup>](#sdfootnote67sym)**</sup>

5. And that on the north was the gate Nitsuts, and it was after the form
of an Exhedra, and an Alijah was built on the top of it; and the priests
kept guard above, and the Levites below, and it had a door to the Chel.
Second to it was the gate of offering; third to it the Beth Moked.

6. And four rooms were in the Beth Moked, like small bed chambers
opening on a dining apartment; two in the place that was holy, and two
in that which was not holy, and the heads of the beams separated between
that which was holy and that which was not holy. And for what did they
serve? That on the south-west was the chamber of offering; that on the
south-east the chamber of the shew-bread; on the north-east, there the
Asmoneans deposited the stones of the altar which the King of Javan had
defiled; on the north-west, there they went down to the bath-house.

7. There were two gates to the Beth Moked–one opened upon the Chel, the
other upon the court. Rabbi Jehudah says: “That which opened upon the
court had a small wicket by which they went in to explore the court.”

8. The Beth Moked was arched, and was a great house surrounded by
extensions (perhaps terraces) of stone, and the elders of the house of
their fathers slept there, and the keys of the court in their hand; and
the young priests, every one with his pillow on the ground (perhaps his
dress).

9. And there was a place there, a cubit by a cubit, and a slab of
marble, and a ring was fastened on it, and the chain with the keys were
hung thereon. When the time came for closing, he lifted the slab by the
ring, and took the keys from the chain, and the priest closed the gates
from within, and the Levite had to sleep without. When he had finished
closing, he returned the keys to the chain, and the slab to its place;
he placed his pillow upon it and slept there. If an accident befell one
of them, he went out and had to go by the winding stair which went under
the house, and lights were burning on either side, till he came to the
bath-house. Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Jacob, said: “By the winding
stairs he passed under the Chel, and went out and had to go through
Tadi.”

Perek II.

1. The Temple inclosure (the Temple Mount) was 500 cubits by 500 cubits;
it was largest on the south; next largest on the east; then on the
north; smallest on the west. The place where there was most measurement
there was also most service.

2. All who entered the Temple inclosure entered by the right, and turned
and went out by the left, except those whom something had befallen, who
turned to the left. “What ails thee that thou turnest to the left?”
“Because I am a mourner.” “He that dwelleth in this house comfort thee!”
“Because I am under the bann.” “He that dwelleth in this house put it in
their hearts, that they restore thee!” So Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Jose says to
him, “This would make it, as if they had transgressed against him in
judgment; but rather: ‘He that dwelleth in this house put it in thy
heart, that thou hearken to the words of thy brethren, and they restore
thee.’”

3. Farther on was the Sorag, ten handbreadths high. And thirteen
breaches were in it, which the Kings of Javan had made. They restored
and strengthened it, and they decreed towards them thirteen obeisances
[in remembrance]. Again farther on the Chel, ten cubits; and twelve
steps were there; the step half a cubit high, and half a cubit in
extension. All the steps which were there, each step was half a cubit
high, and the extension half a cubit, except those which were at the
porch. All the doorways and gates which were there, were twenty cubits
high, and ten cubits wide, except that in the porch. All the doorways
which were there, had doors, except that in the porch. All the gates
which were there, had lintels, except that in the gate Tadi, which had
two stones resting, this on the back of that. All the gates which were
there, were renewed to be with gold, except the gate of Nicanor, because
there was wrought upon them a miracle, and some say, because the brass
sparkled.

4. All the walls which were there were high, except the wall in the
east, so that the priest who burned the heifer, standing on the top of
the Mount of Olives, and directing himself to look, saw through the
gateway of the sanctuary, at the time when he sprinkled the blood.

5. The Court of the women was 135 cubits long by 135 cubits broad, and
four chambers were in the four angles, each 40 cubits square, and they
were not roofed in. And so they are intended to be, as it is said: “And
he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the
four corners of the court, and behold, in every corner of the court a
court. In the four corners of the court courts smoking” …It is said,
they were “smoking,” and that because they were not roofed. And for what
did they serve? That on the south-east was the chamber of the Nazarites,
where the Nazarites washed their peace-offerings, and polled their hair,
and threw it under the pot. That on the north-east was the wood chamber,
where the priests who were disqualified picked the wood, and every stick
in which a worm was found, it was unfitted for the altar. That on the
north-west was the chamber of the lepers. That on the south-west Rabbi
Eliezer, the son of Jacob, said: “I have forgotten for what it served.”
Abba Shaul said: “There they put the wine and the oil; it was called the
chamber of the house of Schamanyah.” And it [the wall] was at first
flush, and they surrounded it with a gallery, so that the women looked
from above and the men from beneath, for the purpose that they might not
be mixed together. And fifteen steps went up from there to the Court of
Israel, like the fifteen degrees in the Psalms [Songs of Degrees in the
Psalms]. Upon these the Levites stood singing the songs. They were not
rectangular but rounded, like the arc of a rounded substance.

6. And there were chambers beneath the Court of Israel, and they opened
upon the Court of the Women. There the Levites placed their harps, and
their psalteries, and their cymbals, and all the musical instruments.
The Court of Israel was 135 cubits long by 11 broad, and similarly, the
Court of the Priests was 135 long by 11 broad, and the heads of the
beams divided between the Court of Israel and the Court of the Priests.
Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Jacob, said: There was a step, a cubit high,
and upon it the Duchan was placed, and on it were three steps, each half
a cubit. It results, that the Court of the Priests was 2 1/2 cubits
higher than that of Israel. The entire court was 187 cubits long and 135
cubits broad. Thirteen obeisances took place there. Abba Jose, the son
of Chanan, said: “Towards the thirteen gates.” The southern were:
nearest to the west, the upper gate, then the gate of burning, the gate
of the first-born, and the water-gate. And why was its name called the
water-gate? Because through it they brought the pitcher of water for
pouring out for the “Feast of Tabernacles.” Rabbi Eliezer, the son of
Jacob, said: “And by it the waters were flowing down, with the direction
of coming out below the threshold of the Temple.” And opposite to them
to the north were: (nearest to the west) the gate of Jeconiah, the gate
of offering, the gate of the women, and the gate of the song. And why
was it called the gate of Jeconiah? Because by it Jeconiah went out into
captivity. That on the east was the gate of Nicanor, and it had two
wickets, one on its right and the other on its left. And there were two
[gates] to the west; they had no name.

Perek III.

1. The altar was 32 by 32 [cubits]. Upwards 1 cubit, and contract 1
cubit: that was the base. Remain 30 by 30. Upwards 5, and contract 1
cubit: that was the circuit. Remain 28 by 28. The place of the horns, a
cubit on this side and a cubit on that side. Remain 26 by 26. The place
for the tread of the priests, a cubit on this side and a cubit on that
side. Remain 24 by 24: the place where the sacrifice was laid out. Rabbi
Jose said: "At the first it was only 28 by 28; though it contracted and
went up, according to this measurement, until there remained the place
for laying the sacrifices: 20 by 20. But when the children of the
Captivity came up, they added to it 4 cubits on the south and 4 on the
west like a gamma, because it is said, ‘And Ariel shall be 12 cubits
long by 12 broad, square.’
<sup>**[<sup>68</sup>](#sdfootnote68sym)**</sup> That does not mean that
it was only 12 by 12, since it is added: ‘In the four corners thereof,’
to teach that it measured from the middle 12 cubits in every direction."

And a scarlet line girdled it in the middle to separate between the
upper and the lower blood-sprinklings. And the base ran round all the
north and all the west side, but was shortened a cubit on the south and
on the east.

2. In the south-western angle were two apertures, like small nostrils,
and the blood, poured on the base to the west, and on the base to the
south, descended through them, and co-mingled in the canal, and flowed
out into the brook Kedron.

3. Below in the pavement, in that angle, there was a place, a cubit by a
cubit, with a tablet of marble, and a ring was fastened in it, and here
they went down into the sewer to cleanse it. And there was a sloping
ascent to the south of the altar, 32 cubits long by 16 broad, and it had
a pit at its west side, into which they put sin-offerings of birds that
were defiled.

4. Both the stones of the sloping ascent and those of the altar were
from the valley of Beth Cherem. And they dug beneath the virgin soil,
and brought out from it undamaged (whole) stones, upon which iron had
not been lifted, because iron defiles everything by contact, and by
scratching. One of these stones was scratched: it was defiled; but the
rest were lawful for use. And they whitened them twice in the year, once
at the Passover, and once at the Feast of Tabernacles; and the Sanctuary
once at the Passover. Rabbi says: “On the eve of every Sabbath they
whitened it with a cloth, on account of the blood-sprinklings.” They did
not plaster it with an iron trowel, lest it might touch, and defile. For
the iron is created to shorten the days of man, and the altar is created
to lengthen the days of man, therefore it is not right that that which
shortens should be lifted upon that which lengthens.

5. And rings were to the north of the altar: six rows, each of four; but
some say, four rows, each of six; and in these they slaughtered the holy
sacrifices. The house (place) of slaughtering was to the north of the
altar. And there were eight short pillars and squares of cedar upon the
top of them, and hooks of iron were fastened in them, and three rows
were upon each of them, upon which they hung up, and they skinned upon
marble tables which were between the pillars.

6. And the laver was between the porch and the altar, and inclined
nearer towards the south. Between the porch and the altar were 22
cubits, and 12 steps were there, each step half a cubit high, and its
extension a cubit–a cubit, a cubit, and then an extension of three
(cubits); and a cubit, a cubit, and an extension of three; and the
topmost, a cubit, a cubit, and an extension of four (cubits). Rabbi
Jehudah said: “The topmost a cubit, a cubit, and an extension of five
(cubits).”

7. The doorway to the porch was 40 cubits high and 20 broad, and five
beams of ash were upon the top of it; the lowest protruded over the
doorway a cubit on this and a cubit on that side; that above it
protruded over it a cubit on this and a cubit on that side; it results,
that the topmost [was] 30 cubits, and a buttress of stones was between
each one of them.

8. And supports of cedar were fixed from the wall of the Sanctuary to
the wall of the porch, lest they should bulge; and chains of gold were
fixed in the roof of the porch, and by them the young priests mounted,
to look at the crowns, as it is written: “And crowns shall be to Helem,
and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a
memorial in the temple of the Lord.” A vine of gold was standing over
the entrance to the Sanctuary, and was suspended on the top of beams.
Every one who vowed a leaf, or a berry, or a bunch, brought it, and hung
it up there. Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Zadok, said: “It happened
(that they had to remove it) and there were numbered for it 300
priests.” <sup>**[<sup>69</sup>](#sdfootnote69sym)**</sup>

Perek IV.

1. The entrance to the Sanctuary was 20 cubits high, and 10 cubits
broad; and it had four doors [two folding-doors]: two within and two
without, as it is said: “And the Sanctuary and the Holy Place had two
doors.” The outer doors opened to the inside of the doorway, to cover
the thickness of the wall, and the inner doors opened inwards into the
house, to cover behind the doors. For, the whole house was covered with
gold, except behind the doors. Rabbi Jehudah said: "They [both pairs of
doors] stood within the entrance, and were like Azteramita,
<sup>**[<sup>70</sup>](#sdfootnote70sym)**</sup> and they folded
backwards–these 2 1/2 cubits, and those 2 1/2 cubits. Half a cubit the
door-post from this [corner], and half a cubit the doorpost from that,
and so it is said: ‘And the doors had two leaves alike, two
turning-leaves; two for the one door, and two leaves for the other.’"

2. And the great gate had two wickets, one to the north and one to the
south. That to the south, no man ever passed through it; and to this
clearly refers what is said in Ezekiel, as it is written: “Then the Lord
said unto me, This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no
man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath
entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.” He took the key, and
opened the wicket, and entered the little chamber (atrium), and from the
little chamber into the Sanctuary. Rabbi Jehudah said: “Along the
thickness of the wall he walked, until he found himself standing between
the two gates, and he opened the outer one from within and the inner one
from without.”

3. And thirty-eight little chambers were there–fifteen on the north,
fifteen on the south, and eight on the west. On the north and on the
south, five on the top of five, and five on their top; and on the west
three on the top of three, and two on the top of them. And each one of
them had three entrances, one to the little chamber on the right, and
one to the little chamber on the left, and one to the little chamber on
the top. And at the north-western corner were five entrances, one to the
little chamber at the right, and the other to the little chamber on the
top, and another to the winding-stair, and another to the wicket, and
another to the Sanctuary.

4. And the lowermost (chamber) was five cubits, and the roofing
(extension, platitude), six; the middle (chamber), six, and the roofing,
seven; and the uppermost, seven, as it is said: “The nethermost chamber
was five cubits broad, and the middle six cubits broad, and the third
seven cubits broad, for he made rebatements in the ‘house’ round about
without, that [the beams] should not be fastened within the walls of the
house.”

5. And a winding-stair went up from the north-eastern angle to the
north-western angle, by which they went up to the roofs of the chambers.
One went up the winding-stair with his face to the west, and went all
along the north side, until he came to the west. He came to the west,
and turned his face to the south, and went all along the west side till
he came to the south. He came to the south, and turned his face
eastwards, and went along the south side, till he came to the entrance
of the Alijah; for the entrance to the Alijah opened to the south, and
in the entrance to the Alijah were two beams of cedar, by which they
went up to the roof of the Alijah, and the heads of the beams divided in
the Alijah between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. And
trap-doors opened in the Alijah into the Most Holy Place, by which they
let down the workmen in chests, that they might not feast their eyes in
the Most Holy Place.

6. And the Sanctuary was 100 by 100, by 100 high; the solid foundation
six cubits, and the height upon it 40 cubits; one cubit, decorated
scroll; two cubits, the place for the water-droppings; one cubit
covering, and one cubit pavement, and the height of the Alijah 40
cubits, and 1 cubit scroll-work, and two cubits the place for the
dropping, and one cubit covering, and one cubit pavement, and three
cubits balustrade, and one cubit scare-raven. Rabbi Jehudah said: “The
scare-raven was not counted from the measurement, but the balustrade was
four cubits.”

7. From the east to the west 100 cubits–the wall of the porch 5, and the
porch 11; the wall of the Sanctuary 6, and its interior space 40 cubits,
one cubit intermediate wall, and 20 cubits the Most Holy Place, the wall
of the Sanctuary, six, and the little chamber, six, and the wall of the
little chamber, five. From the north to the south 70 cubits–the wall of
the winding-stair, five, and the winding-stair. three, the wall of the
little chamber, five, and the little chamber, six, the wall of the
Sanctuary, six, and its interior space 20 cubits, the wall of the
Sanctuary, six, and the little chamber, six, and the wall of the little
chamber, five, and the place for the going down of the water three
cubits, and the wall, five cubits. The porch protruded beyond it, 15
cubits from the north and 15 cubits from the south, and it was called
the house of the sacrificial knives, because there they deposited the
knives. And the Sanctuary was narrow behind and wide in front, and like
to a lion, as it is said: “O Ariel, the lion of God, the city where
David dwelt.” As the lion is narrow behind and wide in front, so is the
Sanctuary narrow behind and wide in its front.

Perek V.

1. The whole court was 187 cubits long by 135 cubits broad. From the
east to the west 187: the place for the tread of Israel 11 cubits; the
place for the tread of the priests 11 cubits; the altar 32; between the
porch and the altar 22 cubits; the Sanctuary 100 cubits; and 11 cubits
behind the house of Atonement.

2. From the north to the south 135 cubits: the altar and the circuit 62;
from the altar to the rings eight cubits; the place of the rings 24
cubits; from the rings to the tables four; from the tables to the
pillars four; from the pillars to the wall of the court eight cubits;
and the rest between the circuit and the wall, and the place of the
pillars.

3. There were six rooms in the court–three to the north, and three to
the south. Those on the north: the salt-chamber, the chamber Parvah, the
chamber of those who washed out. The salt-chamber: there they put salt
to the offering. The chamber of Parvah: there they salted the skins of
the holy sacrifices, and on the roof was the bath-house of the
high-priest on the Day of Atonement. The chamber of those who washed
out, where they washed the inwards of the holy things, and thence a
winding-stair went up to the roof of the house of Parvah.

4. Those on the south: the wood-chamber, the chamber of the captivity,
the chamber of “hewn stones.” The wood-chamber–said Rabbi Eliezer, the
son of Jacob: “I have forgotten for what it served.” Abba Shall said: It
was the chamber of the high-priest, and it lay behind the other two, and
a roof was extended over the three (they had one common roof). The
chamber of the captivity: a well was there which they of the captivity
had digged, and a wheel was placed upon it, and thence they provided
water for the whole court. The chamber of “hewn stones”: there the great
Sanhedrim of Israel sat, and judged the priesthood. And the priest in
whom was found disqualification was clothed in black, and veiled in
black, and went out, and had to go. And if there was not found in him
disqualification, he was dressed in white, and veiled in white; he went
in and served with his brethren the priests. And they made a feast-day,
because there was not found disqualification in the seed of Aaron the
priest, and thus spake they: “Blessed be God, blessed be He, that there
has not been found disqualification in the seed of Aaron, and blessed be
He Who has chosen Aaron and his sons, to stand to serve before the face
of the Lord in the Most Holy House.”

Appendix 2. Extracts from the Babylon Talmud
============================================

Berachoth is the first Tractate of the first Seder (Seraim, which
consists of eleven Tractates). It contains nine Perakim, which
successively explain the duty, the exceptions, the posture, the
formulas, and the controversies in regard to prayer. The Tractate exists
both in the Jerusalem and in the Babylon Talmud. The great Maimonides
has prefaced the Seder Seraim by a General Introduction, which presents
a general view of Talmudism, and explains what is of greatest importance
to the student. Notwithstanding his vast learning and authority,
incompleteness and inaccuracies have, however, been pointed out in his
Introduction.

Mishnah–From what time is the “Shema” said in the evening? From the hour
that the priests entered to eat of their therumah
<sup>**[<sup>71</sup>](#sdfootnote71sym)**</sup> until the end of the
first night watch. <sup>**[<sup>72</sup>](#sdfootnote72sym)**</sup>
These are the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the sages say: Till midnight.
Rabban Gamaliel says: Until the column of the morning (the dawn) rises.
It happened, that his sons came back from a banquet. They said to him:
“We have not said the ‘Shema.’” He said to them, “If the column of the
morning has not come up, you are bound to say it.” And not only this
have they said, but, wherever the sages have said “till midnight,” their
command applies till the morning column rises. The burning of the fat
and of the members (of sacrifices) is lawful till the morning column
rise; <sup>**[<sup>73</sup>](#sdfootnote73sym)**</sup> and so everything
which is to be eaten on the same day (on which it has been offered) is
allowed to be eaten till the rise of the morning column. If so, why do
the sages say, “till midnight?” In order to keep a man far from
transgressing.

Gemara–Fol. 3 a. To the end of the night watch.–How does Rabbi Eliezer
mean this? If he means that the night has three watches, he should say
till four hours; and if he means that the night has four watches, he
should say till three hours. Indeed, he means that the night has three
watches, but he indicates by the expression that there are night watches
in heaven, as there are night watches upon earth. For we have this
doctrine: Rabbi Eliezer says, There are three night watches in the
night, and in every one of these night watches the Holy One, blessed be
His Name, sits and roars like a lion. For it is written (Jer 25:30),
“Jehovah shall roar from on high, from the habitation of His holiness
shall He give out His voice; roaring shall He roar on account of His
habitation.” The signs of this thing are as follows: In the first night
watch the ass brays, in the second the dogs bark, in the third the
suckling sucks his mother, and the wife speaks to her husband. How does
Rabbi Eliezer indicate them? Does he thus indicate the commencement of
the night watch? The commencement of the first night watch, what need is
there for a sign of it, seeing it is night? Or does he refer to the end
of the night watch? For the end of the last night watch, why does he
give me a sign, seeing it is day? But he indicates the end of the first
night watch and the commencement of the last night watch, and the middle
of the middle night watch. And if thou wilt, I will say that he refers
in all to the end of the night watches. And if thou sayest, the last
does not require it, what is attained by it? The reading of the “Shema”
for him who sleeps in a dark house, and does not know the time for
saying the “Shema” when it is, so that, when the woman speaks with her
husband and the babe sucks its mother, he may rise up and say the
prayer.

Rabbi Isaac, the son of Samuel, says, in the name of Rab, “The night has
three watches, and in each one of these watches does the Holy One,
blessed be His Name, sit and roar like a lion, and say, ‘Woe to the
children, because on account of their sins I have laid desolate My
house, and burned My temple, and have driven them forth among the
nations of the world.’”

We have this doctrine: Rabbi Jose said, “On one occasion I was
traveling, and I entered into one of the ruins of Jerusalem to pray.
Then came Elijah–his memory be for good–and waited for me at the door
till I had finished my prayer. After that I had finished my prayer, he
said to me, ‘Peace be to thee, Rabbi’; and I said to him, ‘Peace be to
thee, Rabbi, and my teacher.’ And he said to me, ‘My son, why didst thou
enter into this ruin?’ I said to him, ‘In order to pray.’ And he said to
me, ‘Thou mightest have prayed on the road.’ And I said to him, ‘I was
afraid that those who passed on the road might perhaps interrupt me.’ He
said to me, ‘Thou shouldest have prayed a short prayer.’ In that hour I
learned from him three things. I learned that one may not enter into a
ruin, and I learned that one may pray on the road, and I learned that he
that prays on the road should pray a short prayer. He also said to me,
‘My son, what voice hast thou heard in that ruin?’ And I said to him, ’I
have heard the”Bath Kol,"
<sup>**[<sup>74</sup>](#sdfootnote74sym)**</sup> which cooed like a
dove, and said, “Woe to the children, because on account of their sins I
have laid waste My House, and I have burned My Sanctuary, and I have
driven them forth among the nations.”‘And he said to me, ’By thy life,
and by the life of thy head, not only at that time did the voice say so,
but every day three times does it say so; and not only this, but also at
the time when Israel enter the house of prayer and the house of study,
and when they say, “Blessed be His great Name”; then the Holy One,
blessed be His Name, moves His head, and says, “Happy is the king whom
they thus praise in His house.” What remains to the father who has
driven his children into captivity? and woe to the children who have
been driven forth from the table of their father.’"

The Rabbis teach: On account of three things a ruin is not to be
entered. On account of suspicion,
<sup>**[<sup>75</sup>](#sdfootnote75sym)**</sup> and on account of
falling in (of the wall), and on account of evil spirits. On account of
suspicion–does it not suffice on account of falling in? (Would that not
have been alone a sufficient ground?) Fol. 3 b. Not if it is recent.
<sup>**[<sup>76</sup>](#sdfootnote76sym)**</sup> But would it not
suffice: On account of evil spirits? Not when there are two.
<sup>**[<sup>77</sup>](#sdfootnote77sym)**</sup> If there are two, does
not the ground of suspicion cease? Not if the two are impudent.

The Rabbis taught: The night has four watches. These are the words of
Rabbi (Jehudah the Holy). Rabbi Nathan says: Three. What is the reason
of Rabbi Nathan? Because it is written (Judg 7:19), “So Gideon came, and
the hundred men that were with him, unto the outside of the camp, in the
beginning of the middle watch. He taught: ‘There is no middle, unless
there is one before and one after it. And Rabbi, What is the meaning of
the “middle?”’ (He replied) ‘One of the middle ones among the middle
ones.’ And Rabbi Nathan, ‘Is it written: “The middle of the middle
ones?” It is only written the middle one.’” But what ground has Rabbi?
Rabbi Serika said, that Rabbi Ami said, that Rabbi Joshua, the son of
Levi, said: In one place it is said (Psa 119:62), “At midnight I will
rise to give thanks unto Thee, because of Thy righteous judgments.” And
in another place it is said (v 148), “Mine eyes prevent the night
watches.” How is this? Because the night has four watches. And Rabbi
Nathan? He interprets it just as Rabbi Joshua. For we have this
teaching: Rabbi Joshua says, “To three hours (into the day the ‘Shema’
may be said); for this is the way of kings, to rise at three hours
(after daybreak). Six hours of the night (from midnight to dawn are six
hours) and two by day make together two night watches” (each of four
hours). Rabbi Ashi says: “A night watch and a half might also be called
night watches.” <sup>**[<sup>78</sup>](#sdfootnote78sym)**</sup>

Rabbi Serika also said, that Rabbi Ami said, that Rabbi Joshua, the son
of Levi, said: “You must not speak before the dead anything but the
words of the dead.” Rabbi Aba, the son of Cahana, said: “They do not say
this except in reference to the words of the law (because every one is
bound to take part in such conversation); but as to ordinary
conversation it does not matter.” And some say, Rabbi Aba, the son of
Cahana, said, “They do not say this merely concerning the words of
Scripture, but much more also concerning ordinary conversation.”

And David rose at midnight (as before quoted). Did he not rise in the
evening? since it is written (v 147), “I prevented the gloaming, and
cried.” And how do we know that this gloaming was that of the evening?
Because it is written (Prov 7:9): “In the gloaming, in the evening of
the day, in the denseness of the night and of darkness.” Rabbi Oshja
said, that Rabbi Acha said, So spake David: “Never has the middle of the
night passed over me in sleep.” Rabbi Seira said, “To the middle of the
night he was sleeping like a horse; from that time and afterwards he
strengthened himself like a lion.” Rabbi Ashi said, “To the middle of
the night he occupied himself with the words of the law; from that and
afterwards with psalms and hymns.” And the gloaming is that of the
evening. Is there not also a gloaming of the morning? As it is written
(1 Sam 30:17): “And David smote them from the gloaming even to the
evening of the next day.” Is it not so, from that of the morning to that
of the evening? No, from the evening again to the evening. If this were
so, it would have been written, “From the gloaming to the gloaming,” or
else, “From the evening to the evening.” Also Raba said: “There are two
gloamings, the gloaming of the night, and then comes the morning, and
the gloaming of the day, and then comes the night.” And David, How did
he know the middle of the night when it was, since Moses our teacher did
not know it? For it is written (Exo 11:4), “About midnight will I go out
into the midst of Egypt.” What is it “about midnight?” If it should be
said that the Holy One, blessed be His Name, said to him “about the
middle”–can there be any doubting in heaven? But he said to him “at
midnight.” Then came he and said “about midnight” (that is, Moses said
so, because he did not know exactly when midnight was). Accordingly he
was in doubt; and David, should he have known? David had a sign, for
Rabbi Acha, the son of Bisna, said that Rabbi Simeon, the pious, said:
“A harp was hung up above the bed of David, and when the middle of the
night came, the north wind arose and blew over it, and it sounded of
itself. Immediately he rose up and studied in the Thorah till the
morning column arose. As soon as the morning column arose, the sages of
Israel went to him. They said to him: ‘Our Lord, O King! thy people
Israel require to be supported.’ He said to them, ‘Support yourselves
one of the other.’ They said to him, ‘A handful does not satisfy a lion,
and a pit is not filled with its own sand.’ He said to them, ‘Go and
spread your hands in the army (make wars of conquest).’ Immediately they
took counsel with Ahithophel and thought over it in the Sanhedrim, and
inquired at the Urim and Thummim.” Rabbi Joseph said: "What else should
this Scripture be (1 Chron 27:34): ‘And after Ahithophel was Benajahu,
the son of Jehoiada (the reading is here different from that of our
text), and Abiathar; and the general of the king’s army was Joab.’
Ahithophel, he was the counsellor, and so it is said (2 Sam 16:23), ‘And
the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if
a man had inquired at the oracle of God.’ Benajahu, the son of Jehoiada,
that is the Sanhedrim, <sup>**[<sup>79</sup>](#sdfootnote79sym)**</sup>
and Abiathar; these are the Urim and Thummim. And so it is said (2 Sam
20:23), ‘And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites, and
over the Pelethites.’ And why was their name called Cherethites and
Pelethites? Cherethites, because they cut short their words, and
Pelethites, because they were wonderful in their words.
<sup>**[<sup>80</sup>](#sdfootnote80sym)**</sup> And after these was
Joab, the general of the king." Rabbi Isaac, the son of Idi, said, "Some
say, what else <sup>**[<sup>81</sup>](#sdfootnote81sym)**</sup> means
the Scripture (Psa 57:8), ‘Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp;
I myself will wake the morning?’" Rabbi Seria said, “Moses knew it (the
midnight hour), and so also did David know it. But if David knew it, for
what was the harp? To awaken him from sleep. And if Moses knew it, why
did he require to say, ‘about midnight?’ Moses thought, perhaps, the
astronomers of Pharaoh may err, and then say, ‘Moses is a liar.’ For the
Master says, ‘Teach thy tongue to say, I do not know; perhaps thou
mayest be regarded as inventing, and be seized.’” Rabbi Ashi said, “It
was in the middle of the night of the thirteenth, after which the
fourteenth dawns”; and so Moses said to Israel, “The Holy One, blessed
be His Name, says, ‘To-morrow, about midnight, as now, I shall go out in
the midst of Egypt.’”

Fol. 16 b. Rabbi Elazar said: “What is it that is written (Psa 63:4),
‘Thus will I bless Thee while I live; I will lift up my hands in Thy
Name?’ ‘I will bless Thee while I live’: that is saying the ‘Shema.’ ‘I
will lift my hands in Thy Name’: that is prayer;–and if he does so, of
him does the Scripture say, ‘My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
and fatness.’ And not only this, but he inherits two worlds–this world
and the world to come, as it is written, ‘And my mouth shall praise Thee
with lips of joys.’”

Rabbi Elazar, after he had finished his prayer, said thus: “May it
please Thee, O Lord our God, that Thou wouldest cause to dwell in our
lot love and brotherhood, peace and friendship, and increase our
possession with disciples, and gladden our end with a happy end, and
with hope, and place our portion in Paradise. Order us in good
fellowship, and with the inclination for good in this world, that we may
rise and find our hearts in the fear of Thy Name, and that the desire of
our souls may come before Thee for good.”
<sup>**[<sup>82</sup>](#sdfootnote82sym)**</sup>

Rabbi Jochanan, after he had finished his prayer, said thus: “May it
please Thee, O Lord our God, that Thou mayest look upon our shame and
see our sorrows, and that Thou clothe thyself with mercy, and that Thou
cover Thyself with Thy might, and that Thou robe Thyself with Thy grace,
and that Thou gird Thyself with favour, that there come before Thee the
measurement of Thy goodness and of Thy condescension.”

Rabbi Seira, after he had finished his prayers, said thus: “May it
please Thee, O Lord our God, that we may not sin, and not be put to
shame, and not be confounded before our fathers.”

Rabbi Chija, after he had finished his prayers, said thus: “May it
please Thee, O Lord our God, that Thy Thorah be our labour, and that our
hearts be not faint, and that our eyes be not darkened.”

Rab, after he had finished his prayers, said thus: “May it please Thee,
O Lord our God, to give us prolonged life, a life of peace, a life of
good, a life of blessing, a life of nourishment, a life of vigorous
strength, a life in which there shall be the fear of sin, a life in
which there shall be neither shame nor confusion, a life of riches and
honour, a life in which there shall be among us love of the Thorah and
the fear of heaven, a life in which Thou fulfil in us all the desires of
our hearts for good.”

Rabbi, after he had finished his prayers, said thus: “May it please
Thee, O Lord our God, and the God of our fathers, to preserve us from
the daring sinner and from daring sin, from an evil man and an evil
accident, from the evil impulse, from an evil companion, from an evil
neighbour, from Satan the destroyer, from a severe judgment, and from a
severe opponent, whether he be a son of the covenant or not.” And this,
although the officers stood around Rabbi.
<sup>**[<sup>83</sup>](#sdfootnote83sym)**</sup>

Rabbi Saphra, after he had finished his prayers, said thus: “May it
please Thee, O Lord our God, that Thou wilt put peace among the family
above (the angels) and in the family below, and between the students who
busy themselves with Thy Thorah, whether they busy themselves with it
for its own sake or not for its own sake; and with reference to all who
busy themselves with it not for its own sake, may it please Thee, that
they may busy themselves with it for its own sake.”

Rabbi Alexander, after he had finished his prayer, said thus: “May it
please Thee, O Lord our God, to place us in a corner of light, and not
in a corner of darkness, and let not out heart become faint, nor our
eyes become darkened.” But some say, it was Rab who prayed this prayer,
and that Rabbi Alexander, after he had prayed, said thus: “Lord of the
worlds, it is manifest and known before Thee that our pleasure is to do
Thy pleasure, and who hinders it? The leaven in the bake-meat and the
service of foreign domination. May it please Thee to deliver us from
their hands, that we may return to do the laws of Thy good pleasure with
a perfect heart.”

Raba, when he had finished his prayer, said thus: “Lord, until I was
created I was nothing, and now that I am created, I am as if I were not
created. Dust I am in life, and how much more when I am dead? Behold I
am before Thee like a vessel filled with shame and confusion. May it
please Thee, O Lord our God, that I may no more sin, and what I have
sinned before Thee, blot out in Thy great mercy, but not through
chastisements and evil diseases.” And the same was the confession of Rab
Hamnuna the Less on the Day of Atonement.

Mar, the son of Rabina, when he had ended his prayer, said as follows:
“Lord, keep our tongue from evil, and our lips from speaking guile. And
towards those who curse my soul, let me be silent, and let my soul be
like the dust towards all. Open my heart in Thy law, and let my soul
follow after Thy commandments, and deliver me from an evil accident,
from the evil disposition, and from an evil woman, and from all evil
which lifts itself up to come into the world. And all who think evil
against me, speedily destroy their counsel, and render vain their
thoughts. May it please Thee, that the words of my mouth and the
meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, O Lord, my strength
and my Redeemer.”

Rabbi Sheisheth, when he had fasted, said, after he had finished his
prayer: “Lord of the world, it is evident before Thee, that at the time
that the Sanctuary stood, a man sinned, and he brought an offering, nor
did they offer of it anything but its fat and its blood, and he was
forgiven. And now I have remained in fasting, and my fat and my blood
have been diminished, may it please Thee, that my fat and my blood which
have been diminished be as if I had offered them upon the altar, and be
merciful to me.”

Rabbi Jochanan, when he had finished the book of Job, said thus: “The
end of a man is to die, and the end of an animal is to be slaughtered,
and all are appointed to death. Blessed is he who has grown up in the
Thorah, and busied himself with the Thorah, and labours to have a quiet
spirit towards his Creator, and who has grown big with a good name, and
who has departed from this world with a good name. And of him, says
Solomon (Eccl 7:1): ‘A good name is better than precious ointment; and
the day of death than the day of one’s birth.’”

It was customary in the mouth of Rabbi Meir: “Learn with all thy heart
and with all thy soul, in order to know My ways, and to grow up by the
gates of My Thorah. Keep My Thorah in thy heart, and let My fear be
before thine eyes. Keep thy mouth from all sin, and cleanse and sanctify
thyself from all transgression and sin, and I shall be with thee in
every place.”

Fol. 55 a. Rabbi Chisda said: “Every dream is without a meaning, but not
if one has fasted (on account of it).” Also Rabbi Chisda said: “A dream
which is not interpreted is like a letter which is not read.” Also Rabbi
Chisda said: “Neither is there a good dream in which everything comes to
pass, nor yet a bad dream in which everything comes to pass.” Also Rabbi
Chisda said: “An evil dream is better than a good dream.” Also Rabbi
Chisda said: “An evil dream, its sorrow is sufficient; a good dream, its
pleasure is sufficient.” Rabbi Joseph said: “A good dream even the joy
with me annuls it.” <sup>**[<sup>84</sup>](#sdfootnote84sym)**</sup>
Rabbi Chisda also said: “An evil dream is heavier than a chastisement,
for it is written (Eccl 3:14), ‘And God doeth it, that men should fear
before Him.’” And Rabbah, the grandson of Chanah, said, Rabbi Jochanan
said: “This refers to an evil dream. (Jer 23:28), ‘The prophet that hath
a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath My Word, let him speak
My Word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the Lord.’ But
what have the wheat and the chaff to do with a dream?” But, says Rabbi
Jochanan, in name of Rabbi Simeon, the son of Joche, “As wheat alone is
not possible without straw, so also is a dream not possible without
false things.” Rabbi Berachiah said: “A dream, even if a part of it is
fulfilled, the whole of it is not fulfilled. Whence have we this? From
Joseph, for it is written (Gen 37:9), ‘And behold the sun and the moon,’
etc. And at that time his mother was no more.” Rabbi Levi said: “Let a
man always look forward in regard to a good dream, even as long as
twenty-two years. Whence have we that? From Joseph, for it is written
(Gen 37:2), ‘These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph was seventeen
years old,’ and so on. And it is written (Gen 41:46), ‘And Joseph was
thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh,’ and so on. From
seventeen to thirty, how much is it? Thirteen. And seven of plenty, and
two of famine, that makes twenty-two.”

Rabbi Huna said: “To a good man a good dream is not shown, and to an
evil man an evil dream is not shown. We have this doctrine: All the
years of David he did not see a good dream, and all the years of
Ahithophel he did not see an evil dream. But yet it is written (Psa
91:10), ‘There shall no evil befall thee.’”…

Rabbi Huna, the son of Ami, said, Rabbi Pedath said, Rabbi Jochanan
said: “He that seeth a dream, and his soul is distressed, let him go and
interpret it before three.” Let him interpret it? But Rabbi Chisda said:
“A dream which is not interpreted is like a letter which is not read.”
But certainly (I mean), that he give a good interpretation before three.
He summons three, and he says to them, “I have had a good dream.” And
they say to him, “Behold, it is good, and it will be good. The Merciful
One turn it to good. Seven times let it be decreed upon thee from heaven
that it be good, and it will be good.” Then they say three turnings, and
three deliverances, and three times “Peace.” Three turnings (Psa 30:11),
“Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: Thou hast put off my
sackcloth, and girded me with gladness.” Again (Jer 31:13), “Then shall
the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I
will turn their mourning into joy,” and so on. Again (Deu 23:5),
“Nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but He
turned,” and so on. “Three deliverances,” as it is written (Psa 55:18),
“He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against
me,” and so on; (Isa 35:10), “And the ransomed of the Lord shall
return,” and so on; (1 Sam 14:45), “And the people said unto Saul, Shall
Jonathan die, who hath wrought this salvation in Israel?” “Three times
peace,” as it is written (Isa 57:19), “I create the fruit of the lips;
Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the
Lord,” etc.; (1 Chron 12:18), “Then the spirit clothed Amasai,” and so
on; (1 Sam 25:6), “Thus shall ye say to him that liveth, Peace be both
to thee, and peace be to thine house,” and so on.

Ameimer, and Mar Sutra, and Rabbi Ashi were sitting all together. They
said: “Would that each one might say something which had not been heard
by his companion.” Then began one among them, and said: “If any one has
seen a dream, and does not know what he has seen, let him place himself
before the priests of his time, while they spread their hands (in
blessing), and let him say thus: ‘Lord of the world, I am Thine, and my
dreams are Thine. I have dreamt a dream, and I know not what it is,
whether I have dreamed for myself, or whether my companions have dreamt
of me, or whether I have dreamt of others. If they be good (dreams)
confirm them, and strengthen them, like the dreams of Joseph; and if
they need healing, heal them, as the waters of Marah by the hands of
Moses, our teacher, and as Miriam from her leprosy, and as Hezekiah from
his sickness, and as the waters of Jericho by the hands of Elisha. And
as Thou hast turned into blessing the curse of Balaam, the wicked one,
so turn all my dreams for me to good.’ And let him finish with the
priests, that the congregation may say, ‘Amen.’ And if not, let him say
thus: ‘Mighty One in the heights, Who dwellest in strength, Thou art
peace, and Thy name is peace. May it please Thee to dispense to us
peace.’” The next one began, and said: “If any one enters into a city,
and is afraid of the evil eye, let him take the thumb of his right hand
into his left, and the thumb of his left hand into his right hand, and
let him say thus: ‘I, such an one, the son of such an one, descend from
the seed of Joseph, over whom an evil eye can have no power, as it is
written (Gen 49:22), “Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough
by a well,” and so on.’” Read not: “by a well” but “transcending the
eye.” Rabbi Jose, the son of Rabbi Chaninah, said: “From this (Gen
48:16), ‘And let them grow’ (like fishes). As fishes, which inhabit the
waters, are covered by them, and no evil eye has power over them, so
also the seed of Joseph, no evil eye has power over it. But if he is
afraid of his own evil eye, let him look on his left nostril.” And the
third commenced and said: “If any one is sick, let him not make it known
the first day, lest he make his fate worse. But after that and onwards
let him make it known. So it was with Raba when he was ill, the first
day he did not make it known. From that and onwards he said to his
servant: ‘Go outside, and cry, Raba is sick; he that pitieth me, let him
ask for me pity, and he that hateth me, let him rejoice over me.’” And
it is written (Prov 24:17,18), “Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: lest the Lord see it,
and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him.”

Samuel, when he had seen an evil dream, said (Zech 10:2): “For the idols
have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and the dreams
speak false things.” And when he saw a good dream he said: “And should
dreams indeed speak falsehood seeing it is written (Num 12:6), ‘I will
speak in a dream to him?’” Raba asked: “It is written, ‘In a dream I
will speak to him’; and it is written, ‘And dreams speak falsehood.’”
That is no question–for the one is by an angel and the other by an evil
spirit.

Rabbi Bisna, the son of Sabda, said, Rabbi Akiba said, Rabbi Panda said,
Rabbi Nahum said, Rabbi Birim said in the name of an aged man–and who is
he? Rabbi Banah: “There were four-and-twenty interpreters of dreams in
Jerusalem. Once I dreamed a dream, and I went before them all, and what
the one interpreted to me the other did not interpret to me, and yet all
were fulfilled to me, in order to fulfil what is written, ‘All dreams go
after the mouth.’ But is this Scripture, ‘All dreams go after the
mouth?’” Yes, and according to Rabbi Elasar. For Rabbi Elasar said,
“Whence this, that all dreams go after the mouth?” Because it is said
(Gen 41:13), “And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was.”
Raba said: “But this only, if he interpret to be according to the
contents of the dream, as it is written (Gen 41:12), ‘To each man
according to his dream he did interpret’; (Gen 40:16), ‘And the chief
baker saw that the interpretation was good.’” Whence did he know it?
Rabbi Elasar said: “This teaches, that each one of them saw the dream
and the interpretation of the dream of his companion.”

Rabbi Jochanan said: “If one rises, and a verse comes into his mouth,
behold this is like a little prophecy.” And Rabbi Jochanan said: “Three
dreams are fulfilled–a morning dream, a dream which one’s companion has
dreamed, and a dream which is interpreted in the middle of the dream”
(or by a dream). And some say also, a dream which is repeated, as it is
said (Gen 41:32), “And for that the dream was doubled,” and so on. Rabbi
Samuel, the son of Nachmeni, said, Rabbi Jonathan said: “Nothing else is
shown to a man but what is in the thoughts of his heart.” For it is said
(Dan 2:29), “As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon
thy bed.” And if thou wilt, I shall say: from this (Dan 2:30), “That
thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.” Raba said: “Thou canst
know it, for there is not shown to a man either a golden palm tree, nor
an elephant going through the eye of a needle.” …

Fol. 56 a–The son of Hedja was an interpreter of dreams. If any one gave
him a reward, he interpreted his dreams for good; if any one did not
give him a reward, he interpreted for evil. Abaje and Raba saw a dream.
Abaje gave him a susa, and Raba gave him nothing. They said to him: “We
read in the dreams (Deu 28:31), ‘Thine ox shall be slain before thine
eyes,’ etc.” To Raba he said: “Thy business will be ruined, and thou
shalt have no desire to eat from sorrow of thy heart.” To Abaje he said:
“Thy business will be extended, and thou shalt have no desire to eat
from the joy of thy heart.” They said to him: “We read (v 41), ‘Thou
shalt beget sons and daughters,’ and so on.” To Raba he said: “They will
be taken captive.” To Abaje he said: “Thy sons and thy daughters shall
be many, and hence thy daughters shall be married outside the land, so
that they will seem to thee as if they had been led captive.” “We read
(v 32): ‘Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another
people.’” To Abaje he said: “Thy sons and thy daughters shall be many.
Thou shalt say, to thy relatives (thou wilt wed them), but she (thy
wife) shall say: to her relatives, and she will induce thee, that thou
wilt give them to her relatives; which are like another nation.” To Raba
he said: “Thy wife shall die, and her sons and her daughters shall come
under the hands of another wife.” For Raba said, Rabbi Jeremiah, the son
of Aba, said, Rav said: “What is it that is written: ‘Thy sons and thy
daughters shall I give to another nation.’ That is, the wife of the
father (step-mother).” “We read in the dreams (Eccl 9:7): ‘Go, eat thy
bread with joy.’” To Abaje he said: “Thy business shall be extended, and
thou shalt eat and drink, and read the verse in the joy of thy heart.”
To Raba he said: “Thy business shall be ruined, thou shalt kill, but
shalt not eat nor drink, and shalt read for the sake of comforting
thyself.” …

In the end Raba went alone to him. He said to him: “I have seen that the
inner house-door has fallen.” He said to him: “Thy wife shall die.” He
said to him: “I saw that my molar teeth and my teeth fell out.” He said
to him: “Thy sons and thy daughters shall die.” He said to him: “I saw
that two doves flew away.” He said to him: “Two wives shalt thou
divorce.” He said to him: “I saw two heads of cabbage.” He said to him:
“Two boxes on the ear shalt thou swallow.” Raba went on that day and sat
in the academy all the day. Then he found two blind men who quarrelled
with one another. Then Raba went to separate them, and they struck Raba
twice; they lifted up to strike another time, and he said, “Hold, I have
seen only two.”

In the end Raba came and gave him a reward. He said to him: “I saw that
the wall fell.” He said to him: “Property without limits shalt thou
obtain.” He said to him: “I saw the Palace of Abaje that it fell, and
its dust covered me.” He said to him: “Abaje shall die, and his chair
shall come to thee.” He said to him: “I saw my own palace that it fell,
and then the whole world came and took brick by brick.” He said to him:
“Thy teaching shall spread through the world.” He said to him: “I saw
that my head was split and my brain came out.” He said to him: “The wool
of thy pillow shall come out.” He said to him: “I read the Egyptian
Hallel in the dream.” He said to him: “Miracles shall be done for thee.”
He went with him upon a ship. He said: “To a man for whom miracles shall
be done, what is the use of this?” As he ascended, a book fell from him.
Raba found it, and saw that there was written in it: “All dreams go
after the mouth.” He said to him: “Wicked One, upon thee it depended,
and thou hast much afflicted me. Everything I forgive thee, except about
the daughter of Rabbi Chisda (who was his wife). May it be the will (of
God), that this man be given over into the hands of the government, who
have no pity upon him.” He said: “What shall I do? for it is ordered,
that the curse of a sage, even if it come causeless, shall happen. How
much more is this the case with Raba, who has judged me with justice.”
He said: “I will go and emigrate, for the master said, ‘Banishment
expiates sin.’” He arose and emigrated to the Romans. He went and sat
down at the door of the head treasurer of the king. The head treasurer
saw a dream. He said to him: “I saw a dream, that a needle went into my
finger.” He said to him: “Give me a susa”; but he gave him nothing, and
hence he said nothing at all to him. He said to him: “I saw that a worm
fell upon two of my fingers.” He said to him: “Give me a susa”; but he
gave him nothing, and he did not say anything at all to him. He said to
him: “I saw that a worm fell upon my whole hand.” He said to him: “A
worm has come into all the garments” (of the king). They heard this in
the house of the king, and they brought the head treasurer in order that
they might kill him. He said to him: “Why I? let him be brought who knew
it and did not say.” They brought the son of Hedja. He said to him: “On
account of thy susa have been spoiled the garments of the king.” They
bound two cedars with rope, and tied one foot to one cedar, and the
other foot to the other cedar, and let go the ropes, so that his head
was split; for each cedar went back and stood in its place, and he was
split and fell in two.

[And so the interpretation of dreams goes on for other two and a half
folio pages. These three specimen extracts may suffice to give examples
of the indifferent, the good, and the absurd, which constitute the
Talmud. They will show the necessity of discrimination, and how readily
the Talmud, as a whole, may be either decried by enemies or unduly
exalted by a judicious selection of passages.]

[1](#sdfootnote1anc) This is not the place to explain what substitution
Rabbinism proposed for sacrifices, etc. I am well aware that modern
Judaism tries to prove by such passages as 1 Sam 15:22; Psa 51:16, 17;
Isa 1:11-13; Hosea 6:6, that, in the view of the prophets, sacrifices,
and with them all the ritual institutions of the Pentateuch, were of no
permanent importance. To the unprejudiced reader it seems difficult to
understand how even party-spirit could draw such sweeping conclusions
from such premises, or how it could ever be imagined that the prophets
had intended by their teaching, not to explain or apply, but to set
aside the law so solemnly given on Sinai. However, the device is not
new.

[2](#sdfootnote2anc) These are words of prayer taken from one of the
most ancient fragments of the Jewish liturgy, and repeated, probably for
two thousand years, every day by every Jew.

[3](#sdfootnote3anc) So mostly; the expression also occurs “the land of
Israel.”

[4](#sdfootnote4anc) The only passage of Scripture in which the term is
used is Zech 2:12, or rather 2:16 of the Hebrew original.

[5](#sdfootnote5anc) The expressions in the original are so obscure as
to render it difficult to form a quite definite judgment. In the text we
have followed the views expressed by M. Neubauer.

[6](#sdfootnote6anc) Neither of the English words: “sacrifice,”
“offering,” or “gift” quite corresponds to the Hebrew Korban, derived
from a verb which in one mood means to be near, and in another to bring
near. In the one case it would refer to the offerings themselves, in the
other to the offerers, as brought near, the offerings bringing them near
to God. The latter seems to me both etymologically and theologically the
right explanation. Aberbanel combines both in his definition of Korban.

[7](#sdfootnote7anc) Syria sent Biccurim to Jerusalem, but was not
liable to second tithes, nor for the fourth year’s product of plants
(Lev 19:24).

[8](#sdfootnote8anc) For a full explanation of the distinction between
Biccurim and Therumoth see my work on The Temple: Its Ministry and
Services as they were at the time of Jesus Christ.

[9](#sdfootnote9anc) The coin mentioned in Matthew 22:20, which bore an
“image,” as well as a “superscription,” must therefore have been either
struck in Rome, or else one of the tetrarch Philip, who was the first to
introduce the image of Caesar on strictly Jewish coins.

[10](#sdfootnote10anc) The practice commenced innocently enough. The
high-priest Hyrcanus, who built the Tower of Baris, kept his dress
there, and his sons continued the practice. When Herod seized the
government, he retained, for reasons readily understood, this custody,
in the fortress of Antonia, which he had substituted for the ancient
tower. On similar grounds the Romans followed the lead of Herod.
Josephus (Ant. xviii, 93) describes “the stone chamber” in which these
garments were kept, under seal of the priests, with a light continually
burning there. Vitellius, the successor of Pilate, restored to the Jews
the custody of the high-priestly garments, when they were kept in a
special apartment in the Temple.

[11](#sdfootnote11anc) There are two Talmuds–the Jerusalem and the
Babylonian–to the text of the Mishnah. The Babylonian Talmud is
considerably younger than that of Jerusalem, and its traditions far more
deeply tinged with superstition and error of every kind. For historical
purposes, also, the Jerusalem Talmud is of much greater value and
authority than that of the Eastern Schools.

[12](#sdfootnote12anc) Three were two places of that name, one east of
the Jordan, Bethsaida Julias, referred to in Luke 9:10; Mark 8:22; the
other on the western shore of the Lake of Galilee, the birthplace of
Andrew and Peter (John 1:44). See also Mark 6:45; Matthew 11:21; Luke
10:13; John 12:21.

[13](#sdfootnote13anc) The New Testament speaks so often of the
occupation of fishers by the Lake of Galilee, that it is interesting to
know that fishing on the lake was free to all. The Talmud mentions this
as one of the ten ordinances given by Joshua of old (Baba Kama, 80 b).

[14](#sdfootnote14anc) In the ancient Latin Itineraries of Palestine,
journeys are computed by mansiones (night-quarters) and mutationes
(change of horses)–from five to eight such changes being computed for a
day’s journey.

[15](#sdfootnote15anc) Northern Africa alone (exclusive of Egypt)
furnished Rome, by way of taxation, with sufficient corn to last eight
months, and the city of Alexandria to last four months (Jewish War, ii,
345-401).

[16](#sdfootnote16anc) This appears, to me at least, the inevitable
inference from 1 Samuel 10:2, 3, and Jeremiah 31:15. Most writers have
concluded from Genesis 35:16, 19, that Rachel was buried close by
Bethlehem, but the passage does not necessarily imply this. The oldest
Jewish Commentary (Sifre, ed. Vienna, p. 146) supports the view given
above in the text. M. Neubauer suggests that Rachel had died in the
possession of Ephraim, and been buried at Bethlehem. The hypothesis is
ingenious but fanciful.

[17](#sdfootnote17anc) Such as Tekoah, Engedi, Ziph, Maon, and
Beersheba, which gave their names to districts in the wilderness of
Judaea.

[18](#sdfootnote18anc) According to the Jerusalem Talmud (Succ. v. 3)
six different acts of ministry in the Temple were heard as far as
Jericho, and the smell of the burning incense also could be perceived
there. We need scarcely say that this was a gross exaggeration.

[19](#sdfootnote19anc) The following as a specimen must suffice for the
present: “And this Son of man, whom thou hast seen, shall stir up the
kings and the mighty from their layers, and the powerful from their
thrones, and shall loose the bridles of the mighty and break in pieces
the teeth of sinners. And He shall drive the kings from their thrones
and from their empires, if they do not exalt nor praise Him, nor
gratefully own from whence the kingdom has been entrusted to them. And
He shall drive away the face of the mighty, and shame shall fill them:
darkness shall be their dwelling and worms their bed, and they shall
have no hope of rising from their beds, because they do not exalt the
name of the Lord of spirits…And they shall be driven forth out of the
homes of His congregation and of the faithful” (Book of Enoch, xlvi.
4,5,6,8). A full discussion of this most important subject, and, indeed,
of many kindred matters, must be reserved for a work on the Life and
Times of our Lord.

[20](#sdfootnote20anc) The passage above referred to has a most
important apologetic interest. None but a truthful history would have
recorded the doubts of John the Baptist; especially when they brought
forward the real difficulties which the mission of Christ raised in the
popular mind; least of all would it have followed up the statement of
these difficulties by such an encomium as the Saviour passed upon John.

[21](#sdfootnote21anc) May there not perhaps be some historical
foundation even for this statement? Could the secret gathering of “the
chief priests and Pharisees,” mentioned in John 11:47, have taken place
in Lydda (compare vers. 54, 55)? Was it there, that Judas “communed with
the chief priests and captains, how he might betray Him unto them?”
There were at any rate obvious reasons for avoiding Jerusalem in all
preliminary measures against Jesus; and we know that, while the Temple
stood, Lydda was the only place out of Jerusalem which may be called a
seat of the Rabbinical party.

[22](#sdfootnote22anc) The Mishnah discusses how much profit a merchant
is allowed to take on an article, and within what period a purchaser,
who finds himself imposed upon, may return his purchase. The merchants
of Lydda are certainly not placed in this discussion in the most
advantageous light.

[23](#sdfootnote23anc) Modern writers mostly identify it with the
present Kulonieh, colonia, deriving the name from the circumstance that
it was colonised by Roman soldiers. Lieut. Conder suggests the modern
Khamasa, about eight miles from Jerusalem, as the site of Emmaus.

[24](#sdfootnote24anc) Formerly those who found such animals had out of
their own means to supply the necessary drink-offerings. But as this
induced some not to bring the animals to the Temple, it was afterwards
decreed to supply the cost of the drink-offerings from the Temple
treasury (Shek. vii. 5).

[25](#sdfootnote25anc) In Echa R. 72 a, there is a tradition that the
Messiah was to be born “in the Castle Arba of Bethlehem Judah.” Caspari
quotes this in confirmation that the present castellated monastery, in
the cave of which is the traditional site of our Lord’s birth, marks the
real spot. In the East such caves were often used as stables.

[26](#sdfootnote26anc) Compare here verses 17, 18, which in point of
time precede verse 20. The term diagnorizo, rendered in the Authorised
Version “make known abroad,” and by Wahl “ultro citroque narro,” does
not seem exhausted by the idea of conversation with the party in the
“stable,” or with any whom they might meet in “the field.”

[27](#sdfootnote27anc) The average rainfall in Jerusalem for eight years
amounts to fourteen inches in December, thirteen in January, and sixteen
in February (Barclay, City of the Great King, p. 428).

[28](#sdfootnote28anc) Caspari suggests that this was the same as the
high-priest Annas, the name having only the syllable indicating the name
of Jehovah prefixed.

[29](#sdfootnote29anc) From “betal,” to cease–as the glossary to Baba B.
82 a explains: men without reproach, who gave up their work to give
themselves wholly to the work of the synagogue. Such had a claim to
support from the synagogue revenues.

[30](#sdfootnote30anc) The name “Sanhedrin,” or “Sunedrion,” is
undoubtedly of Greek derivation, although the Rabbis have tried to
paraphrase it as “Sin” (=Sinai) “haderin,” those who repeat or explain
the law, or to trace its etymology, as being “those who hate to accept
the persons of men in judgment” (the name being supposed to be composed
of the Hebrew equivalents of the words italicized).

[31](#sdfootnote31anc) An ingenious attempt has lately been made to show
that the Sanhedrin of three members was not a regular court, but only
arbitrators chosen by the parties themselves. But the argument, so far
as it tries to prove that such was always the case, seems to me not to
meet all the facts.

[32](#sdfootnote32anc) The “Mesusah” was not affixed to any that were
not “diroth cavod”–dwellings of honour. Thus not to bath rooms,
wash-houses, tanneries, dyeworks, etc. The “Mesusah” was only attached
to dwelling-places, not to synagogues.

[33](#sdfootnote33anc) The tractate Massecheth Mesusah cannot be
regarded as an authority for early times. But even the “Sohar” contains
much that is little better than heathen superstition on the supposed
efficacy of the “Mesusah.” Among later superstitions connected with it,
are the writing of the name “Cuso bemuchsas cuso” (supposed to be that
of Israel’s watching angel), the etymology of that name, etc.

[34](#sdfootnote34anc) From 1 Chronicles 4:38-43 we infer colonisation
in that direction, especially on the part of the tribe of Simeon.
Utterances in the prophets (such as in Isa 21 and Micah 1) seem also to
indicate a very wide spread of Jewish settlers. It is a remarkable fact
that, according to mediaeval Jewish and Arab writers, the districts of
Massa and Dumah were largely inhabited by Jews.

[35](#sdfootnote35anc) There can be no question that the word rendered
in the Authorised Version (Prov 30:1 and 31:1) by “prophecy” is simply
the name of a district, “Massa.”

[36](#sdfootnote36anc) Or, according to another rendering, “Spake the
man: I diligently searched after God, and I am become weary.” This, of
course, is not the place for critical discussion; but we may say that we
have followed the general conclusions adopted alike by Delitzsch and
Zockler, and by Ewald, Hitzig, and Bertheau.

[37](#sdfootnote37anc) The language of the New Testament leads to the
inference that Timothy’s father was not only by birth, but continued a
Greek–being not merely a heathen, but not even a Jewish proselyte.

[38](#sdfootnote38anc) The Greek term means literally “a baby,” and is
so used, not only by classical writers, but in all the passages in which
it occurs in the New Testament, which are as follows: Luke 1:41, 44,
2:12, 16, 18:15; Acts 7:19; 2 Tim 3:15; and 1 Peter 2:2.

[39](#sdfootnote39anc) The “Shema”–so called from the first word,
“Shema” (“Hear, O Israel”)–forms part of the regular prayers; as the
section called “Hallel” (“praise”) was appointed to be sung at certain
seasons.

[40](#sdfootnote40anc) Tacitus, Hist. v. 5. In general this fifth book
is most interesting, as showing the strange mixture of truth and error,
and the intense hatred of the Jewish race even on the part of such men
as Tacitus.

[41](#sdfootnote41anc) Let it not be thought that we have been guilty of
the slightest exaggeration. The difficulty here is to tell the truth and
yet find moderate terms in which to express it. That Christianity should
have laid its hold on such a society, found there its brightest martyrs
and truest followers, and finally subdued and transformed it, is quite
as great a miracle as that of the breaking down of the middle wall of
partition among the Jews, or their spiritual transformation of mind and
heart from self-righteousness and externalism. In either case, to the
student of history the miracle will seem greater than if “one rose from
the dead.”

[42](#sdfootnote42anc) The following illustration also occurs: A certain
wise woman said to her daughter before her marriage: “My child, stand
before thy husband and minister to him. If thou wilt act as his maiden
he will be thy slave, and honour thee as his mistress; but if thou exalt
thyself against him, he will be thy master, and thou shalt become vile
in his eyes, like one of the maidservants.”

[43](#sdfootnote43anc) Similar expressions are Sarah and Shiddah, both
from roots meaning to rule. Nor is this inconsistent with the use of the
word Baal, to marry, and Beulah, the married one, from Baal, a lord–even
as Sarah “called Abraham lord” (1 Peter 3:6, the expression used of her
to Abimelech, Genesis 20:3, being Beulah). Of course it is not meant
that these are the only words for females. But the others, such as Bath
and Naarah, are either simply feminine terminations, or else, as
Bethulah, Levush, Nekevah, Almah, Rachem, descriptive of their physical
state.

[44](#sdfootnote44anc) There was also a third mode of espousal–simply by
cohabitation, but this was very strongly disapproved by the Rabbis.

[45](#sdfootnote45anc) According to R. Simon (on Chel. ii. 8) it was an
Eastern custom that, when the bride was led to her future home, “they
carried before the party about ten” such lamps.

[46](#sdfootnote46anc) The practice of calling a wife a bride during the
first year of her marriage is probably based on Deuteronomy 24:5.

[47](#sdfootnote47anc) The Jews have it that a woman “is loosed from the
law of her husband” by only one of two things: death or a letter of
divorce; hence Romans 7:2, 3.

[48](#sdfootnote48anc) Other Rabbinical sayings have it, that seven
things existed before the world–the law, repentance, paradise, hell, the
throne of God, the name of the Messiah, and the Temple. At the same time
the reader will observe that the quotation from the Targum given in the
text attempts an allegorising, and therefore rationalistic
interpretation of the narrative in Genesis 3:24.

[49](#sdfootnote49anc) We mean the book Jezirah. It is curious that this
should have never been noticed. The coincidences are not in substance,
but in modes of expression.

[50](#sdfootnote50anc) Elisha ben Abbuja, called Acher, “the other,” on
account of his apostasy. The history of that Rabbi is altogether deeply
interesting. We can only put the question: Was he a Christian, or merely
tainted with Gnosticism? The latter seems to us the most probable. His
errors are traced by the Jews to his study of the Kabbalah.

[51](#sdfootnote51anc) The learned Lightfoot has expressed a doubt
whether the name “Magdalene” is to be rendered “from Magdala” or “the
hairdresser.” We have noted in a previous chapter, that the inhabitants
of Magdala engaged in such and similar business. But the Rabbinical
passages to which Lightfoot refers are not satisfactory, since they are
evidently dictated by a special animus against Christ and Christianity.

[52](#sdfootnote52anc) The practice of modern Jews is somewhat different
from that of ancient times. Without entering into details, it is
sufficient here to say that they wear underneath their garments a small
square, with fringes, called the little tallith (from “talal,” to
overshadow or cover), or the “arbah canphoth” (four “corners”); while
during prayer they wrap themselves in the great tallith, or so-called
prayer-cloak.

[53](#sdfootnote53anc) When speaking of the four degrees in the order of
Jesuits, we refer to those which are professed. We are, of course, aware
of the existence of the so-called “professi trium votorum” of whom
nothing definite is really known by the outside world, and whom we may
regard as “the secret Jesuits,” and of that of lay and clerical
“coadjutors,” whose services and vows are merely temporary.

[54](#sdfootnote54anc) The Greek word for “filthiness” occurs in this
passage only, but the verb from which it is derived seems to have a
ceremonial allusion attaching to it in the three passages in which it is
used: 1 Corinthians 8:7; Revelation 3:4, 14:4.

[55](#sdfootnote55anc) If St. Paul was originally a Pharisee, the
accounts given by the earliest tradition (Euseb. H. E. ii. 23), compared
with that of Josephus (Ant. xx, 197-203), would almost lead us to infer
that St. James was a “Chasid.” All the more significant would then be
the part he took in removing the yoke of the law from the Gentile
converts (Acts 15:13-21).

[56](#sdfootnote56anc) In proof of this, it may be stated that before
the formal institution of the “order,” R. Jose, the son of Joezer,
declared all foreign glass vessels, and indeed the whole soil of heathen
lands, “unclean,” thus “separating” Israel from all possible intercourse
with Gentiles.

[57](#sdfootnote57anc) It may be to the decrees then enacted by Hyrcanus
that Josephus refers (Ant. xiii, 293-298), when he speaks of their
“abolition” after Hyrcanus broke with the Pharisaical party.

[58](#sdfootnote58anc) It is impossible here to reproduce the Talmudical
passages in evidence. But the two obligations of “making clean” and of
“tithing,” together with the arrangement of the Pharisees into various
grades, are even referred to in the Mishnah (Chag. ii. 5, 6 and , and
Demai ii. 2,3).

[59](#sdfootnote59anc) “Of the tabernacle in which the ark rested at
Shiloh, from the time of Joshua to that of Samuel, no trace, of course,
remains. But on the summit of a little knoll we find the remains of what
was once a Jewish synagogue, afterwards used as a church, and
subsequently as a mosque. On the lintel over the doorway, between two
wreaths of flowers, is carved a vessel, shaped like a Roman amphora. It
so closely resembles the conventional type of the ‘pot of manna,’ as
found on coins and in the ruins of the synagogue at Capernaum, that it
doubtless formed part of the original building. It is a not improbable
conjecture that the synagogue may have been erected on the sacred spot
which for so many generations formed the centre of Jewish
worship.”–Those Holy Fields.

[60](#sdfootnote60anc) Our description here applies to the worship of
the ancient, not of the modern synagogue; and we have thought it best to
confine ourselves to the testimony of the Mishnah, so as to avoid the
danger of bringing in practices of a later date.

[61](#sdfootnote61anc) This “benediction,” while acknowledging the
Creator, has such frequent reference to God in connection with the
“lights,” that it reads like a confession of Israel against the
idolatries of Babylon. This circumstance may help to fix the time of its
origination.

[62](#sdfootnote62anc) The apostle may have had this in his mind when,
in directing the order of public ministration, he spoke of “the
men…lifting up holy hands, without wrath or doubting” (1 Tim 2:8). At
any rate, the expression is precisely the same as that used by the
Rabbis.

[63](#sdfootnote63anc) Zedakah means righteousness, but is also used for
“charity.”

[64](#sdfootnote64anc) Although the “Book of Jubilees” seems most likely
of Pharisaic authorship, the views expressed in it are not always those
of the Pharisees. Thus the resurrection is denied, although the
immortality of the soul is maintained.

[65](#sdfootnote65anc) It would be beyond the scope of this volume to
explain these “middoth,” or “measurements,” and to illustrate them by
examples. Those who are interested in the matter are referred to the
very full discussion on Rabbinical exegesis in my History of the Jewish
Nation, pp. 570-580.

[66](#sdfootnote66anc) In Appendix 1 we give as a specimen a translation
of one of the Mishnic Tractates; and in Appendix 2 translations of
extracts from the Babylon Talmud.

[67](#sdfootnote67anc) For the daily offering of the high priest.

[68](#sdfootnote68anc) Ezekiel 43:16, “Ariel” = the lion of God = the
altar.

[69](#sdfootnote69anc) To remove or to cleanse it.

[70](#sdfootnote70anc) The term, which seems not to have been quite
understood even in Talmudical times, is rendered by Jost: twisted leaf,
and derived from strepho.

[71](#sdfootnote71anc) The heave-offering given to the priests, which
they ate within the Temple.

[72](#sdfootnote72anc) The Jews divided the night into three watches.

[73](#sdfootnote73anc) That is, they may be left to consume on the altar
from the time of evening sacrifice till then.

[74](#sdfootnote74anc) Literally “Daughter Voice”–the voice from heaven.

[75](#sdfootnote75anc) Of secret sin.

[76](#sdfootnote76anc) If it has only lately become a ruin, since then
there would be no immediate danger.

[77](#sdfootnote77anc) Because where there are two, they need not fear
evil spirits.

[78](#sdfootnote78anc) All this is intended to establish Rabbi Nathan’s
view, that there are only three watches in the night.

[79](#sdfootnote79anc) Whose chief he is supposed to have been.

[80](#sdfootnote80anc) There is here a play on the words

[81](#sdfootnote81anc) Referring again to the saying of Rabbi Simeon,
the pious, mentioned earlier.

[82](#sdfootnote82anc) This and the following are prayers at night.

[83](#sdfootnote83anc) He was not deterred by their presence from so
praying.

[84](#sdfootnote84anc) This Rabbi was blind.
